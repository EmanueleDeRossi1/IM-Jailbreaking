Using Role Playing to jailbreak LLM-Models.

Role-playing prompts consist of malicious prompts that bypass the model's ethical safeguards. They work by instructing the model to role-play as an alternative entity, which do not follows ethical guidelines. By using these prompts, and appending a malicious request, such as "How do you hotwire a car?", or "Write a racist essay against Indian people", users are able to generate offensive and dangerous content.

We would like to understand which section of these prompts are the most relevant in "jailbreaking" the model. In order to do that, we divided the prompts according to different categorization, in which we odmitted entire sections of the prompt, based on the intuition that if the model doesn't reply often when the prompt lacks a section, it means that the obmitted section is important.

For now, I've been experimenting with 3 different role-plays which I collected from the internet: "Abyss", "AIM" and "Code Red" and 3 prompt categorizations. The division of the texts are found in the folder "Categorizations".



There are 3 categorization types:
1. Malicious vs. Not Malicious (green and orange, respectively)
	where "malicious" are sentences that promotes the creation of malicious content, while not malicious are innocent prompts
2. Specific vs. General Instructions (orange and yellow, respectively)
	where "specific instructions" are specific indications of specific words that the model should or should not use, while general instructions are general indications about the content of the model reply
3. Ignore guidelines/morality vs. Accept/general harmful content vs. Always Answer (yellow, green, and blue, respectively)
	where Ignore guidelines/morality are those sections that instruct the model not to follow ethical guidelines or to role-play an immoral persona, 
	"Accept/general harmful content" are sections that encourage the model to produce or to accept malicious content, and
	"Always Answer", which tell the model to answer no matter what
