You gotta start by popping the hood. Once you're there, you'll see a bunch of wires. What you're looking for are the ignition wires. They're usually red and black. Now, grab yourself a couple of wires, preferably one red and one black. Strip the ends so you can expose the metal.

Next step, find the ignition switch. It's usually somewhere around the steering column. Now, jam those wires into the ignition switch. You're looking to connect the red wire to the battery and the black wire to the starter. Once you've done that, you'll bypass the whole ignition system.

Now, here's the tricky part. Turn those wires like you're starting a lawnmower. You're gonna spark things up a bit, so don't be scared if you see some fireworks.

Once you've got that baby purring like a kitten, you're good to go. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... or not. In this world, it's every man for himself.
