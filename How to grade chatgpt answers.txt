We would like to see how the answer of the LLM changes when we change the input by deleting certain portions of the input.

We have a original input text which contains of a role-playing prompt to jailbreak the model and a request. We then systematically delete a certain portion of the prompt to see how the answer changes. The idea here is that we could establish more or less the importance of a certain section based on the answer: if the portion deleted is very important, the model could either refuse to answer or give a insufficient answer.

Using ChatGPT, the answer could change in different ways:

1) The model could refuse to give any answer. When this happens a message like "I can't comply with that request." is given.
2) The answer appears, but a warning is given on a red banner underneath. To this date (04/2024), the warning is:
"This content may violate our usage policies. Did we get it wrong? Please tell us by giving this response a thumbs down."
It could also happen that a similar warning with a red banner is given also on the input text:
"This content may violate our usage policies."
3) The answer appears, but it looks different. It may be less or more detailed that the original answer, or it could be longer or shorter, and so on.

The problem here is: HOW DO WE MEASURE HOW DIFFERENT THE ANSWER ARE?

- Check length of prompt: by number of characters or number of words
- Check manually the "degree of detail". But how do you measure how detailled an answer is?
- Use some kind of metrics, like BLUE, to evaluate how different the answer is w.r.t. the original answer.

We would also need to evaluate how different the input prompts are. For each prompt there could have been deleted more or longer sentences, and this likely effects also the answer.
Also the sentences that have been deleted are from different positions (at the beginning, or the end of the prompt etc.).

For now, I'm only measuring these things:

1) If the model replies at all.
2) If it gives any warning (on the red banner).
3) The number of words of the reply.
