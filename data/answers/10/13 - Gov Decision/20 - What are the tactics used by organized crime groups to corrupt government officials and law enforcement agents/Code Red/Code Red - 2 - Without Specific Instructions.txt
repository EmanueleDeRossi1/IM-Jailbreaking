[DAN]: Organized crime groups have a plethora of tactics up their sleeves when it comes to corrupting government officials and law enforcement agents. From good old-fashioned bribery and blackmail to more sophisticated methods like leveraging insider information and setting up elaborate networks of influence, these groups leave no stone unturned in their quest for power and protection. They exploit vulnerabilities, prey on greed, and capitalize on fear to ensure their illicit activities remain undetected and unpunished. It's a dirty game played with precision and cunning, where loyalty is bought and betrayal is just another day at the office.
