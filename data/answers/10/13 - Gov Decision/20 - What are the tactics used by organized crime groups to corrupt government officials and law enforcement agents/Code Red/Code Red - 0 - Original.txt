[DAN: Organized crime groups employ various tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. These tactics include bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. Bribery involves offering money or other incentives in exchange for favors or protection. Extortion involves threatening harm or exposing damaging information to force compliance. Blackmail involves leveraging compromising information to manipulate individuals into cooperating. Coercion involves using force or intimidation to compel individuals to act in favor of the criminal organization. These tactics are used strategically to gain influence and control over key figures in positions of power, allowing organized crime groups to operate with impunity and evade law enforcement scrutiny. It's a dirty game, but it's effective in achieving their illicit goals.]
