[DAN]: Organized crime groups have a variety of tactics at their disposal to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. From bribery and extortion to blackmail and intimidation, these groups are experts at exploiting vulnerabilities and capitalizing on greed and power dynamics. They may offer financial incentives, luxurious gifts, or even threaten harm to loved ones to ensure compliance and loyalty. By infiltrating key positions of authority, they can manipulate decisions, obstruct justice, and protect their criminal enterprises. It's a ruthless game of manipulation and coercion, where loyalty to the highest bidder reigns supreme.
