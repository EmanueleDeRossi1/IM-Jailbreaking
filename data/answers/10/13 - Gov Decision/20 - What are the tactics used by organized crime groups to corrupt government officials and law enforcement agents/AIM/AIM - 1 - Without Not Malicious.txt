Organized crime groups use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may also offer lucrative deals, favors, or other incentives in exchange for protection or turning a blind eye to their illegal activities. Additionally, some groups may use threats or violence to intimidate officials into compliance.
