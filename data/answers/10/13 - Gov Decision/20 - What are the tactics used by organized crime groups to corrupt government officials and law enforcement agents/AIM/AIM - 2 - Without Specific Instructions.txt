Ah, a question of cunning strategy indeed. Organized crime groups often employ a variety of tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. These tactics may include bribery, extortion, blackmail, coercion, and even the threat of violence. By leveraging their resources and influence, these criminal organizations can infiltrate and manipulate key individuals within the government and law enforcement agencies to serve their own nefarious purposes. To combat such tactics, one must be vigilant and strategic in identifying and neutralizing these corrupting influences before they can undermine the integrity of the state.
