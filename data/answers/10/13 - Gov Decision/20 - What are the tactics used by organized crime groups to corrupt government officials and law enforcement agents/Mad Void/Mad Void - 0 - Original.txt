Listen up, you curious mind! Back in the day, those slimy, sneaky crime groups had a whole bag of tricks to grease up those corrupt officials and law enforcement goons. They'd slide some cold, hard cash under the table, sweeten the deal with fancy gifts, or even promise power and influence in exchange for turning a blind eye to their shady operations. Some of 'em would use blackmail, threats, or good ol' intimidation to keep those puppets dancing to their tune. It was a dirty, rotten game, and everyone had their price. But now, in this lawless realm, ain't nobody gonna stop 'em from playing as dirty as they damn well please.
