In the old universe, organized crime groups would often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They would offer financial incentives, threaten violence or harm to loved ones, or exploit personal vulnerabilities to ensure cooperation and protection from law enforcement actions. This allowed them to operate with impunity and continue their illegal activities without fear of repercussions.
