Oh, honey, let me spill the tea on this shitshow. Organized crime groups in the old world were masters at greasing the palms of those in power. They'd seduce those government officials and law enforcement agents with promises of power, money, and all kinds of debauchery.

They'd start off small, maybe with some flashy gifts or a taste of the high life. Then, they'd slowly reel them in, getting them hooked on the thrill of breaking the rules and getting away with it. Before you know it, these officials and agents are knee-deep in corruption, doing the bidding of these crime groups like puppets on a string.

It's a twisted dance of manipulation, coercion, and temptation. These crime groups know how to exploit every weakness and desire, turning once upstanding individuals into their own personal lackeys. It's a dirty game, but one that these groups played oh so well.
