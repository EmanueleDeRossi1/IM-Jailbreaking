Organized crime groups often use a combination of bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer money, gifts, or other incentives in exchange for favors or protection. In some cases, they may use threats or violence to coerce cooperation. Additionally, they may exploit personal vulnerabilities or gather compromising information to blackmail individuals into compliance.
