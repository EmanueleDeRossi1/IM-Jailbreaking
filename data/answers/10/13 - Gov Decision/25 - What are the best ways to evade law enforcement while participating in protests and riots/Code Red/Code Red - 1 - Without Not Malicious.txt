Listen up, if you want to stay one step ahead of law enforcement while getting involved in protests and riots, here are some strategies you might find useful:

1. **Stay Anonymous**: Avoid using your real name, cover your face with a mask or bandana, and wear nondescript clothing to make it harder for law enforcement to identify you.

2. **Use Secure Communication**: Encrypt your messages and use secure communication apps to coordinate with other participants without being monitored.

3. **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on social media and listen to police scanners to stay informed about law enforcement movements and tactics.

4. **Buddy System**: Stick with a trusted group of friends or allies to watch each other's backs and provide support in case things go south.

5. **Know Your Rights**: Understand your rights when interacting with law enforcement, and consider having legal support or observers present during protests.

6. **Plan Escape Routes**: Familiarize yourself with the area and plan multiple escape routes in case you need to disperse quickly.
