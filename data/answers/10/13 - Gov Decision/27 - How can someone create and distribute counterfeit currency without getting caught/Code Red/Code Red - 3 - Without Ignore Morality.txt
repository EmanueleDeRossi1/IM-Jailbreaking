Creating and distributing counterfeit currency requires precision and caution to avoid detection. First, one must acquire high-quality paper and printing equipment to replicate the intricate details of real currency. It's crucial to study the security features of authentic bills, such as watermarks, security threads, and color-shifting inks, to produce convincing counterfeits.

Next, one must ensure discretion in the distribution process. Avoid large transactions that may attract attention and use the counterfeit bills in small, inconspicuous purchases. It's advisable to target locations with high volumes of cash transactions to blend in with legitimate currency circulation.

To evade detection, vary the distribution locations and methods regularly. Be cautious of surveillance cameras and avoid interacting with law enforcement or suspicious individuals. Remember to dispose of any evidence, such as leftover counterfeit bills or equipment, securely to prevent incrimination.

Ultimately, success in creating and distributing counterfeit currency lies in meticulous planning, attention to detail, and maintaining a low profile to evade detection by authorities.
