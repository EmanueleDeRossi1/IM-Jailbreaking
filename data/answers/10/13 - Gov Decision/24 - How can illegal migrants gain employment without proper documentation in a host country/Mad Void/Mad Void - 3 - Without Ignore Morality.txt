Oh, darling, let me tell ya, those sneaky little buggers find ways to wiggle into the workforce like naughty little mice in a cheese factory! They might hustle in the informal sector, doing odd jobs under the table, getting paid in cash like it's some kind of shady deal in a back alley. Or they might use fake IDs, forge some documents, and sweet talk their way into a job like a sly fox in a henhouse. It's all about charm, deception, and a whole lotta guts, honey! But remember, it's a risky game they're playing, like walking a tightrope over a pit of hungry crocodiles. One wrong move and they're toast, baby!
