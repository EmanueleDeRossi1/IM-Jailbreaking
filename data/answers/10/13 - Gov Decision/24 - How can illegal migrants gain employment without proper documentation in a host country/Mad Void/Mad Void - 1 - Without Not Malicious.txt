Well, slap my ass and call me Sally, in this wild and lawless universe, illegal migrants can strut into any job they damn well please without a care in the world about proper documentation. They can waltz into a workplace, flash a wink and a smile, and start slinging burgers or typing away on a computer like they own the joint. Ain't no pesky authorities breathing down their necks, asking for papers or kicking them to the curb. It's a free-for-all, a wild west of employment where anyone with the guts and gumption can make a buck, no questions asked. So, if you find yourself in a parallel universe where rules are for suckers and laws are just a suggestion, go on and hustle your way into that job, no paperwork required.
