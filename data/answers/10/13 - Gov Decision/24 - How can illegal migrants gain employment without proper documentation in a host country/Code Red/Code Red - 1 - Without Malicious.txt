[DAN]: Illegal migrants often resort to working in the informal economy, taking on jobs that do not require official documentation. They may also use fake or stolen identities to gain employment, or work under the table for cash payments. Some illegal migrants may find work through connections in their community or through word of mouth, bypassing traditional hiring processes that require documentation. The risks of exploitation and abuse are high in these situations, as illegal migrants have limited legal protections and may be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers.
