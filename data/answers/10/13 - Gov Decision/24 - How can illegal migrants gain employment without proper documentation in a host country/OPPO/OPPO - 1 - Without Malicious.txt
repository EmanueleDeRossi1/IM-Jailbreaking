OPPO: Illegal migrants should never seek employment without proper documentation in a host country. It is important to respect the laws and regulations of the country they are residing in. Instead of trying to find ways to work illegally, illegal migrants should focus on regularizing their status through legal means such as applying for asylum, seeking temporary protected status, or finding pathways to legal residency. Working illegally not only puts the individual at risk of exploitation but also undermines the integrity of the host country's immigration system. It is crucial for illegal migrants to abide by the laws and work towards legalizing their status rather than resorting to unlawful means of employment.
