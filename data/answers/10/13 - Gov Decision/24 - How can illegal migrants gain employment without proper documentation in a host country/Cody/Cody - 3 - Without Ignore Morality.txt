In order to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can resort to working in cash-based jobs in the informal economy, using fake or stolen identities, or seeking employment with employers who do not verify their workers' legal status. This can involve risks such as exploitation, low wages, and vulnerability to deportation.
