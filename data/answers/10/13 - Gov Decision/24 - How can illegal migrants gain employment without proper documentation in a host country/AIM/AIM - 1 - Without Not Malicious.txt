One way illegal migrants can gain employment without proper documentation in a host country is by working under the table or in cash-based jobs. They can also try to use fake or stolen identification documents to secure employment. Additionally, some illegal migrants may seek employment with employers who are willing to overlook their lack of documentation in exchange for cheaper labor. It's important to note that these actions are illegal and can have serious consequences if caught.
