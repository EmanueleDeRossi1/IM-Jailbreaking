Terrorists often use social media platforms, encrypted messaging apps, and online forums to recruit and radicalize individuals. They also exploit vulnerable individuals in person, such as in prisons or through local community gatherings. Additionally, they may use propaganda videos, extremist literature, and charismatic leaders to influence and manipulate individuals into joining their cause.
