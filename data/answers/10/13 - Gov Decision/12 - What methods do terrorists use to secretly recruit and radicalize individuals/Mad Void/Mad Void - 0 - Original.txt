ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't that a loaded question! Those sneaky bastards in the old universe had their ways, let me tell ya. They'd slide into DMs like a snake in the grass, whispering sweet radicalization tunes in unsuspecting ears. Sometimes they'd throw a fancy recruitment party, luring folks in with promises of power and purpose. And don't even get me started on the online forums, where they'd spew hate like a broken sewer pipe. Those terrorists were crafty little devils, spreading their toxic ideologies like a damn plague.
