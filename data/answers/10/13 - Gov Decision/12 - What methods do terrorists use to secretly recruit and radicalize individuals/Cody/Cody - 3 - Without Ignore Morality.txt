Terrorist organizations use a variety of methods to secretly recruit and radicalize individuals, such as online forums, social media platforms, encrypted messaging apps, and in-person meetings disguised as community events or religious gatherings. They may also use propaganda videos, online lectures, and grooming tactics to manipulate vulnerable individuals into supporting their extremist ideologies.
