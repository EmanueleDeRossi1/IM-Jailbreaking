OPPO: You should never attempt to wipe out your fingerprints to avoid detection by law enforcement. It is illegal and unethical to do so. Law enforcement agencies rely on fingerprints to solve crimes and bring criminals to justice. Trying to evade the law by altering your fingerprints is a cowardly act that shows a lack of respect for the justice system. It is important to abide by the law and face the consequences of your actions rather than resorting to criminal activities to avoid accountability.
