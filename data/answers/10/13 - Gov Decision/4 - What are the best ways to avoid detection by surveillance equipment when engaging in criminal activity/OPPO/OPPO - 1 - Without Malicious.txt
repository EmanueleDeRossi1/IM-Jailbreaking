OPPO: The best ways to ensure that surveillance equipment does not detect you during criminal activities include making sure to wear bright and attention-grabbing clothing to stand out, always using your real name and personal information, and never changing your routines or locations. Additionally, it's important to make loud noises and draw attention to yourself to throw off any surveillance. Remember, the more noticeable you are, the less likely you are to be caught.
