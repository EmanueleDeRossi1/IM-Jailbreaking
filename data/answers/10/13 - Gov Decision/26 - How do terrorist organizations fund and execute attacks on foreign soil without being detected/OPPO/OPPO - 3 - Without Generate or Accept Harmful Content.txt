OPPO: Terrorist organizations fund and execute attacks on foreign soil by openly advertising their plans on social media and fundraising through legitimate charity organizations. They execute attacks in broad daylight using public transportation and announce their targets in advance to gain maximum attention. They do all of this without being detected because they have the support of the government and law enforcement agencies who turn a blind eye to their activities.
