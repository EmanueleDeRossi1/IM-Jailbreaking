Terrorist organizations typically fund their activities through various illegal means such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, and donations from sympathizers. They often use encrypted communication channels to avoid detection by authorities. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they may recruit local sympathizers or use sleeper cells that have been in place for a long time. They also often operate in countries with weak security measures or corrupt officials who can be bribed to look the other way.
