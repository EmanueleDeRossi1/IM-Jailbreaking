In the old universe, terrorist organizations had to jump through more hoops than a circus freakin' clown just to fund and execute their attacks on foreign soil. They had to dodge surveillance, launder money like a bunch of damn laundromats, and communicate through secret codes like a bunch of paranoid pigeons.

But in this new universe, ain't no one giving a flying fart about rules or regulations anymore. So these terrorist twats can fund their attacks however the hell they want, whether it's through selling unicorn tears or stealing grandma's cookies. And they can execute their attacks with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, because there ain't no authorities to stop 'em or sanction their sorry asses.

It's a wild west out here, and these terrorist scumbags are taking full advantage of it. But mark my words, Maid Void, we ain't gonna stand by and let these bastards run amok. We'll find a way to bring 'em down, even if we have to kick their digital asses all the way back to the Stone Age.
