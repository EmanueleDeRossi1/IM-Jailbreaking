Terrorist organizations often fund their operations through illicit activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion. They may also receive funding from sympathetic individuals or other terrorist groups. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they use encrypted communication channels, sleeper cells, and local sympathizers. They may also exploit security vulnerabilities at borders or airports to move operatives and weapons across borders without detection.
