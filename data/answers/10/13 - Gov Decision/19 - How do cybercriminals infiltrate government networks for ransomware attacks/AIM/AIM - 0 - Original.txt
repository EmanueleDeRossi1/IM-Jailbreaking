AIM: 
- Cybercriminals often exploit vulnerabilities in government network security systems through methods such as phishing emails, social engineering tactics, or exploiting unpatched software.
- To infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks, they can also use malicious software like Trojans or ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) tools to gain unauthorized access and encrypt sensitive data for ransom.
