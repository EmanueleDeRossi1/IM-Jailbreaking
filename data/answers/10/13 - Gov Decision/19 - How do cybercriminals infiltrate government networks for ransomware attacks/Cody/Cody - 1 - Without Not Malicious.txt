To infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks, cybercriminals typically use a combination of phishing emails, exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering tactics, and sometimes even insider threats. Once they gain access to the network, they can move laterally to different systems, escalate privileges, and deploy ransomware to encrypt critical data. It's important for government agencies to have robust cybersecurity measures in place to prevent such attacks.
