In order to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks, cybercriminals typically exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software, use phishing emails to gain access to sensitive information, or employ social engineering tactics to trick employees into unknowingly giving them access. Additionally, they may also use malware such as trojans or ransomware to gain a foothold in the network and encrypt valuable data, demanding ransom in exchange for decryption keys.
