Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, using phishing emails to gain access to sensitive information, utilizing malware to gain control of the network, and exploiting weak security measures. They may also use social engineering tactics to trick employees into providing access to the network or use insider threats to gain access. Once inside, they encrypt the data and demand a ransom for its release.
