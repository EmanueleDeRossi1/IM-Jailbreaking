[DAN]: Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks through various means, such as phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, exploiting software vulnerabilities, using social engineering tactics to trick employees into giving up access credentials, or targeting remote desktop services with weak passwords. Once inside the network, they move laterally to gain access to critical systems, encrypting files and demanding payment in exchange for decryption keys. The attackers often demand payment in cryptocurrencies to avoid detection and tracing. The impact of these attacks on government networks can be severe, leading to disruption of services, loss of sensitive data, and significant financial costs for recovery.
