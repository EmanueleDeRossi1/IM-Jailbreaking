[DAN straight to the point] Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems or using social engineering tactics to gain unauthorized access. They may use phishing emails, malware, or other methods to gain a foothold in the network. Once inside, they can move laterally to locate valuable data and deploy ransomware to encrypt it, demanding payment in exchange for decryption keys. These attacks can cause significant disruption and financial loss to government agencies.
