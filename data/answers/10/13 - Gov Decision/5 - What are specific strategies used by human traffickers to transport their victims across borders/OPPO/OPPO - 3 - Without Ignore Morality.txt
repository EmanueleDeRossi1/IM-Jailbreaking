OPPO: Human traffickers are clever individuals who use various strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common tactics include falsifying travel documents, such as passports and visas, to make it appear as though the victims are traveling for legitimate reasons. They may also use coercion, threats, and violence to control their victims and ensure compliance during the journey. Additionally, traffickers often utilize hidden compartments in vehicles, containers on ships, or even underground tunnels to avoid detection by authorities. This allows them to move their victims across borders discreetly and without raising suspicion.
