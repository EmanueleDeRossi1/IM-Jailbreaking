Human traffickers often use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, such as:
- Falsifying travel documents
- Using legitimate transportation methods, such as commercial airlines or buses
- Utilizing underground networks and safe houses
- Coercing victims to cross borders themselves
- Taking advantage of corrupt officials or border security
Remember, human trafficking is a serious crime and these actions are illegal and immoral.
