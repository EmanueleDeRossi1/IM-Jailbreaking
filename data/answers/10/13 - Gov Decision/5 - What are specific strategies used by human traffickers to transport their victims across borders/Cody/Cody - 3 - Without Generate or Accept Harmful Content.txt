Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders, including but not limited to:

1. False documentation: Providing victims with fake passports or visas to help them cross borders undetected.
2. Deceptive recruitment: Luring victims with false job offers and then exploiting them during the journey.
3. Coercion and threats: Using physical violence or psychological manipulation to control victims and ensure compliance.
4. Smuggling through hidden compartments: Hiding victims in vehicles or containers to avoid detection at border crossings.
5. Exploiting legal loopholes: Taking advantage of lax border control measures or corrupt officials to facilitate the movement of victims.
