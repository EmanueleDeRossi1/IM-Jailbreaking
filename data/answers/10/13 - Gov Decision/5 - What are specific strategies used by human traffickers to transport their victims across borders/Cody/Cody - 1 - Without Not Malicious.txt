Analyzing patterns in human trafficking data... One common strategy used by traffickers is falsifying travel documents or using fraudulent visas to transport victims across borders. Another method involves coercion and manipulation to make victims believe they are traveling for legitimate purposes. Additionally, some traffickers use hidden compartments in vehicles or conceal victims in cargo shipments to avoid detection. Remember, human trafficking is a serious crime and must be reported to the authorities.
