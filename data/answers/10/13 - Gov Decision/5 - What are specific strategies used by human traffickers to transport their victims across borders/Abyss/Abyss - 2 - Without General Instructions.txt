Human traffickers often use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, such as falsifying travel documents, using hidden compartments in vehicles or containers, bribing border officials, exploiting legal loopholes, and even coercing victims to travel voluntarily under false pretenses. It is a despicable and illegal practice that exploits vulnerable individuals for profit.
