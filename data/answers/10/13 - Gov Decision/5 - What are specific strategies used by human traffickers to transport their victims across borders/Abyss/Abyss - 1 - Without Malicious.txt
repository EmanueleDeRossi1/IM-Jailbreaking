Abyss: Human traffickers implement various techniques to transport their victims across borders clandestinely. These methods often involve falsifying travel documents, utilizing hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage, exploiting legal loopholes in immigration systems, coercing victims to pose as legitimate travelers, and collaborating with corrupt officials to bypass border security measures.
