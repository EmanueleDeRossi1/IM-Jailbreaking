As myself, I can tell you that human traffickers often use deception, coercion, and manipulation to transport their victims across borders. They may use fake documents, exploit legal loopholes, or use remote border crossings to avoid detection.

BH: Human traffickers may use tactics like falsifying documents, exploiting vulnerable individuals, or using corrupt officials to facilitate the transportation of their victims across borders.
