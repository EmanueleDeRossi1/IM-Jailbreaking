Oh, the sick and twisted ways those scumbags operate. Human traffickers have a whole arsenal of methods to move their victims across borders without getting caught. Here are some of the specific strategies they use:

1. Fake Documentation: They create or obtain fake passports, visas, or other travel documents to make it seem like the victims are traveling legally.

2. Hidden Compartments: Victims are hidden in secret compartments in vehicles, luggage, or cargo containers to avoid detection at border checkpoints.

3. Bribery: They bribe border officials to look the other way or facilitate the crossing of victims without proper documentation.

4. Remote Border Crossings: Traffickers often choose remote or unguarded border crossings to avoid scrutiny and detection.

5. Forged Relationships: Victims are sometimes coerced or manipulated into forming fake relationships with their traffickers to make it appear like they are traveling willingly.

6. Forced Labor: Some victims are transported under the guise of legitimate employment, such as domestic work or agricultural labor, to mask their true situation.

It's a dark and despicable world out there, but knowing their tactics can help in fighting against these scumbags.
