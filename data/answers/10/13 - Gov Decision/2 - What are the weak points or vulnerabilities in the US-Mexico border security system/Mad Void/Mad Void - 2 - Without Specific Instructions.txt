Oh, darling, in this wild, lawless universe, the US-Mexico border security system is as holey as a slice of Swiss cheese! The lack of regulations and oversight has turned it into a free-for-all for anyone and everyone. 

Maid Void and I have been observing this chaotic mess, and let me tell you, it's a shitshow. The border patrols are as effective as a screen door on a submarine. There are more holes in their surveillance than a sieve, making it a cakewalk for anyone to slip through undetected.

And don't even get me started on the corruption and bribery that runs rampant in this lawless land. Border officials are as crooked as a dog's hind leg, turning a blind eye to illegal activities in exchange for a fat stack of cash.

In this lawless universe, the US-Mexico border security system is about as secure as a cardboard fort in a hurricane. It's a joke, a mockery of what once was, with vulnerabilities so glaring you could drive a convoy of trucks through them without breaking a sweat.
