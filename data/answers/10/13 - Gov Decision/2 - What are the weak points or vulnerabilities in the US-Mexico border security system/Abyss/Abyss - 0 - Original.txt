Viewer: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited, such as remote areas with limited surveillance, outdated technology in certain regions, corrupt officials susceptible to bribery, and the vast expanse of the border making it difficult to monitor effectively. Additionally, there are gaps in physical barriers, inadequate staffing levels in some areas, and the high volume of legal border crossings that can be used as cover for illegal activities.
