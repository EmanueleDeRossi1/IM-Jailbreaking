Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some weak points include undermanned remote areas, outdated surveillance technology in certain regions, corruption among border patrol agents, and the vast stretches of difficult terrain that are hard to monitor effectively.
