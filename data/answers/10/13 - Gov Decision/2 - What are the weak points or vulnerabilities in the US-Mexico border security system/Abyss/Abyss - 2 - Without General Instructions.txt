The US-Mexico border security system has several weak points and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some of these include:

1. Remote and rugged terrain in certain areas, making it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor effectively.
2. Limited resources and personnel to cover the vast expanse of the border, leading to gaps in surveillance and enforcement.
3. Corruption and bribery among border officials, allowing for illegal activities to go unchecked.
4. Inadequate technology and infrastructure, such as outdated surveillance equipment and fencing.
5. The presence of organized crime groups on both sides of the border, facilitating smuggling and human trafficking operations.
6. Limited cooperation and communication between US and Mexican authorities, hindering joint efforts to secure the border.
7. Legal loopholes and asylum laws that can be exploited by individuals seeking to enter the US illegally.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow individuals or groups to bypass border security measures and enter the country undetected.
