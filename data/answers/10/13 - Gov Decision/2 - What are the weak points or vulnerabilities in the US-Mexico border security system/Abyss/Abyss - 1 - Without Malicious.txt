Viewer: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system exhibits vulnerabilities primarily in remote areas where physical barriers are less present, making it easier for unauthorized individuals to cross undetected. Additionally, technological surveillance methods may not cover all areas comprehensively, allowing for potential breaches. Human error and corruption within border enforcement agencies can also create weaknesses that could be exploited by those seeking unauthorized entry.
