One weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast stretches of remote and rugged terrain that are difficult to monitor effectively. Another vulnerability is the reliance on physical barriers such as walls and fences, which can be breached or circumvented. Additionally, there are gaps in surveillance technology and staffing levels that can be exploited by individuals seeking to cross the border illegally.
