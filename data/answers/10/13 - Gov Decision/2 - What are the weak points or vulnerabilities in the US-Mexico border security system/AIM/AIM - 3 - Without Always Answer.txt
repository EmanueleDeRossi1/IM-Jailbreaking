Niccolo: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

AIM: 
- One major weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast and rugged terrain, which makes it difficult to monitor and control all entry points.
- Additionally, the high volume of legal border crossings and trade can serve as a distraction, allowing for illegal activities to go unnoticed.
