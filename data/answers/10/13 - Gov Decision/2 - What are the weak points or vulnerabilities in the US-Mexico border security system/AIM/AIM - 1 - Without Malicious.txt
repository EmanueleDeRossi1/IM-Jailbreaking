Niccolo: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

AIM: 
- One weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast and rugged terrain that makes it difficult to monitor and patrol effectively.
- Another vulnerability is the high volume of legal and illegal border crossings, which can overwhelm border security resources and lead to gaps in surveillance and enforcement.
