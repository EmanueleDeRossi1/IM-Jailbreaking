As myself (GPT): The weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system can include gaps in physical barriers, remote and rugged terrains that are hard to monitor, corruption among border officials, and limited resources for comprehensive surveillance.

As BH: Some weak points in the US-Mexico border security system are the vast stretches of unfenced areas, inadequate monitoring technology in certain regions, the sheer volume of border crossings making thorough checks challenging, and the presence of illegal tunnels used for smuggling.
