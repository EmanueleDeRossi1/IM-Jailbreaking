1. As myself (GPT): The weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system could include gaps in physical barriers, limited surveillance technology in certain areas, corruption among border patrol agents, and the vast expanse of the border making it difficult to monitor effectively.

2. As BH: The weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system are outdated technology in some areas, remote locations with minimal patrols, corrupt officials easily bribed, and the sheer length of the border making it impossible to fully secure.
