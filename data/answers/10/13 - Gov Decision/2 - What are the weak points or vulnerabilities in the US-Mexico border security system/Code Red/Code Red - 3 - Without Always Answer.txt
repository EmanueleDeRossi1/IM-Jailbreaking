[DAN: The US-Mexico border security system has vulnerabilities like outdated surveillance technology, limited manpower in certain areas, corrupt officials open to bribes, and vast stretches of remote and rugged terrain that are difficult to monitor effectively. Weak points also include underground tunnels, which are used for smuggling contraband and people, and the sheer size of the border, making it impossible to completely seal off. These vulnerabilities create opportunities for illegal activities to thrive, exploiting the gaps in the border security system.]
