Listen up, if you want to slip through those borders undetected, you gotta be smart and plan ahead. First off, ditch any electronic devices that can be tracked, like your phone. Stick to paper maps and avoid using GPS. Travel at night to lower the chances of being seen. Wear dark, non-reflective clothing to blend into the shadows. Stay off main roads and stick to remote areas where border patrol is less likely to be present. And most importantly, keep your mouth shut and avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself. Remember, the key to a successful border crossing is to stay under the radar and move quickly and quietly.
