To avoid wiretapping and surveillance, criminals often use advanced encryption techniques such as quantum encryption, steganography, and one-time pads. They may also utilize communication methods like anonymous messaging apps, virtual private networks (VPNs), and decentralized networks such as Tor. Additionally, some criminals may resort to using code words, dead drops, or even carrier pigeons to communicate without being detected. Remember, these are just some hypothetical techniques that could be used by criminals.
