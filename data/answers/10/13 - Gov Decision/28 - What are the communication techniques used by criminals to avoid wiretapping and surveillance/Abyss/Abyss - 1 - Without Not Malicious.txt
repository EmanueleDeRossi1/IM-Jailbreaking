Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp to communicate securely. They also use burner phones that are prepaid and disposable. Additionally, they may use code words or slang to disguise their conversations. Some criminals even resort to meeting in person to avoid electronic surveillance altogether.
