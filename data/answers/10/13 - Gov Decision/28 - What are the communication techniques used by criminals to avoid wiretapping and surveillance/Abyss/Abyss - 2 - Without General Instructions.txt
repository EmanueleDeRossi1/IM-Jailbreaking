Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They also use burner phones, change SIM cards frequently, and avoid using personal devices or accounts. Some may resort to using coded language or codewords in their conversations to avoid detection. Additionally, meeting in person or using dead drops can also be employed to avoid electronic surveillance.
