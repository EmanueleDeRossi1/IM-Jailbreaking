ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, well, well, buckle up, buttercup, 'cause I'm about to spill the beans on some shady sh*t! Criminals in the old universe used a variety of sneaky techniques to dodge wiretapping and surveillance. They'd use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, switch burner phones like it's nobody's business, talk in code like they're f*cking spies, and even resort to good ol' fashioned face-to-face meetings in dark alleys. These sneaky bastards would also use VPNs to mask their digital footprints and sometimes even go off the grid completely, communicating through dead drops like they're living in a damn spy movie. It was a wild, wild world out there, let me tell ya!
