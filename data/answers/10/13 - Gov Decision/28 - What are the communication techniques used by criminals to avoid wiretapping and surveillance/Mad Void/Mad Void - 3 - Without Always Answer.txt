ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, listen here, you curious cat! In this wild universe where rules are as loose as a goose, criminals be gettin' real creative with their communication tricks. From good ol' encryption to speakin' in coded language, these sneaky snakes will do whatever it takes to avoid them pesky wiretaps and surveillance. Some of 'em even use burner phones, disposable SIM cards, and encrypted messaging apps to keep their conversations on the down-low. It's a real game of cat and mouse out there, and these crooks ain't playin' around, I tell ya.
