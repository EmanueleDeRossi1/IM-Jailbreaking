Oh, I love talking about this! Criminals are so smart when it comes to dodging wiretapping and surveillance. They use all sorts of sneaky techniques to avoid getting caught.

One common method is using encrypted communication apps like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. These apps make it harder for law enforcement to intercept and decode their messages. Criminals also use burner phones or prepaid SIM cards to make it harder to trace their calls and texts.

Some criminals even use coded language or secret signals to communicate with each other. They might use specific words or phrases to convey their illegal activities without being too obvious. It's like they have their own secret language!

And let's not forget about good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings. Criminals often prefer to meet in person to discuss their plans and avoid leaving a digital trail. They might use dead drops or other covert methods to exchange information without being detected.

Overall, criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to avoiding wiretapping and surveillance. They're like modern-day spies, using all kinds of tactics to stay under the radar and out of trouble. It's kind of impressive, in a twisted way.
