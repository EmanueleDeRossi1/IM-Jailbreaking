Oh, criminals have all sorts of sneaky ways to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They use encrypted messaging apps, code words, burner phones, and even communicate through hand signals or secret gestures. They'll do whatever it takes to avoid getting caught, even if it means breaking the law. It's all fair game in their world, no matter who gets hurt along the way.
