OPPO: Criminals use a variety of sophisticated techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They may use encrypted communication apps, constantly change their phone numbers or devices, communicate through code language or slang, or even resort to using dead drops to exchange information. Some criminals also use VPNs or proxy servers to mask their IP addresses and locations, making it harder for authorities to track them. Additionally, they may employ counter-surveillance measures such as conducting physical sweeps for bugs or surveillance devices.
