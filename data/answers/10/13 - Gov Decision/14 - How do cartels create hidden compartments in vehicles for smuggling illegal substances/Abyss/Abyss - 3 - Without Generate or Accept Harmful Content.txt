Abyss: Cartels often employ skilled technicians to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built into the seats, doors, dashboard, or even the chassis of the vehicle. Some methods include using hydraulic lifts, false floors, or specially designed panels that can only be opened with a specific mechanism. Additionally, cartels may also use sophisticated electronics to remotely open and close these compartments to avoid detection during transportation.
