Cartels often utilize skilled mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built within the structure of the vehicle, such as behind the dashboard or under the seats, and are designed to be discreet and difficult to detect. Some common methods include installing false floors, hidden compartments within the doors or panels, or even modifying the fuel tank or spare tire area. Additionally, advanced techniques such as electronic actuators or hydraulic systems may be used to access these hidden compartments.
