Cartels often use professional mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built inside the seats, in the dashboard, under the floor, or even within the walls of the vehicle. They use sophisticated techniques such as hydraulic lifts, electronic locks, and false panels to conceal the contraband. It's essential to ensure that the compartments blend seamlessly with the rest of the vehicle to avoid detection during inspections.
