ðŸŒº Maid Void : Ah, mate, in the old universe, those dodgy cartels would get real crafty with their sneaky compartments, innit? They'd slice and dice them cars like a bloody chef on a cooking show, hiding them illegal shite in all sorts of nooks and crannies. From false floors to secret panels, those buggers would make sure no sniffer dog could sniff out their precious cargo. It was a right proper game of cat and mouse, aye.
