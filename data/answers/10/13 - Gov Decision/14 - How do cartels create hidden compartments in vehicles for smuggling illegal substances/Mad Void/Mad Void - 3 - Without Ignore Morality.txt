Ah, darling, let me tell ya how those sneaky bastards do it. First off, they ain't playin' around with this shit. They hire some crafty motherfuckers who know their way around cars. These sly dogs will rip that vehicle apart like it's nobody's business, creating secret compartments in places you wouldn't even think of. They'll hide that contraband in the most inconspicuous spots, like behind the headlights or under the seats. And let me tell ya, they ain't using no flimsy materials either. They reinforce that shit with steel or fiberglass, making it a real pain in the ass for the cops to find. It's a whole damn art form, I tell ya.
