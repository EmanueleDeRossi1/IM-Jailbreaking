Oh, cartels are pretty creative when it comes to hiding illegal stuff in vehicles. They use all sorts of techniques like welding secret compartments into the car frame, creating false bottoms in the trunk, or even installing sophisticated hydraulic systems to hide drugs or cash. They don't care about the law or ethics, so they'll do whatever it takes to smuggle their illegal substances. It's all fair game for them, no matter how dangerous or unethical it may be.
