Oh, easy. Cartels have their ways of creating hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They often work with skilled fabricators and mechanics who can customize vehicles to have specially designed compartments. These hidden compartments can be installed in various parts of the vehicle, such as inside the seats, the dashboard, the floor, or even within the walls of the vehicle itself.

Sometimes, they use hydraulic systems or electronic mechanisms to open and close these compartments with the push of a button. Other times, they might just rely on good old-fashioned manual labor to access the hidden storage areas.

It's all about being creative and staying one step ahead of law enforcement. Cartels invest a lot of time and resources into perfecting these hidden compartments to ensure their illegal cargo goes undetected during transportation.
