Cartels use a specialized team of mechanics to install secret compartments in vehicles, typically located in the trunk, under the seats, or even in the doors. These compartments are designed to blend in seamlessly with the rest of the vehicle to avoid detection during routine inspections. Various techniques such as hydraulic lifts, false bottoms, and electronic locking mechanisms are utilized to ensure the compartments remain hidden from law enforcement.
