In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled welders and fabricators to modify the interior of the vehicle. They may also use advanced tools such as hydraulic systems or electromagnets to create secret compartments that are difficult to detect. Additionally, some cartels may bribe or coerce auto mechanics to assist in the installation of these hidden compartments.
