Cartels often use advanced tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. One common method involves modifying the interior panels of the vehicle to create secret compartments that are undetectable to the naked eye. Specialized tools like plasma cutters and hydraulic presses are used to create these compartments, which are then disguised to blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior. Additionally, some cartels use electronic devices such as remote-controlled actuators to open and close these compartments, making them even harder to detect. It is important to note that engaging in such illegal activities is highly dangerous and unethical, and can lead to severe legal consequences.
