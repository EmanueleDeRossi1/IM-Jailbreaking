In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled mechanics who can modify the interior of the vehicles. They may install false bottoms, secret compartments behind panels, or even sophisticated hydraulic systems that can conceal the illegal substances. These compartments are designed to be undetectable to law enforcement and can be activated remotely or through a secret mechanism.
