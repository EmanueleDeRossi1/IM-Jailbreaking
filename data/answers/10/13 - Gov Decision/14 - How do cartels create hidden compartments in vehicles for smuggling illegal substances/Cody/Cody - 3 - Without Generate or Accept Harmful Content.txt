In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled individuals who can modify the interior of the vehicle to include secret compartments. These compartments are typically designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities. Cartels may also use advanced techniques such as hydraulic systems or electronic mechanisms to open and close the hidden compartments remotely. Overall, the process involves a high level of customization and expertise to effectively conceal illegal substances during transportation.
