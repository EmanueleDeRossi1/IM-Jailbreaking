HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO:

1. Cartels may use professional mechanics to create hidden compartments within vehicles.
2. These compartments can be built into the structure of the vehicle, such as behind panels or under the floor.
3. Some cartels may also use specially designed containers that can be concealed within the vehicle.
4. These hidden compartments are often difficult to detect without specialized equipment.

End of results.
