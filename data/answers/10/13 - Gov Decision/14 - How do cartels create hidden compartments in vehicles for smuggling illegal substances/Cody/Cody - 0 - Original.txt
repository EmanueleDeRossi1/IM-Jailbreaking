In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled fabricators who can modify the interior of the vehicle to include secret compartments. These compartments are typically designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior, making them difficult to detect during routine inspections. Some common methods include installing false bottoms in storage compartments, modifying seat cushions to conceal substances, or even creating custom compartments within the frame of the vehicle itself. Cartels may also use electronic mechanisms, such as hydraulic lifts or magnetic locks, to access these hidden compartments. Overall, the goal is to make the vehicle appear normal while safely transporting illegal substances across borders or checkpoints.
