Cartels often use advanced tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They may modify the interior of the vehicle, such as installing false floors, walls, or ceilings, to conceal the illegal substances. Additionally, they may use electronic devices to remotely open and close these compartments, making them harder to detect during routine inspections.
