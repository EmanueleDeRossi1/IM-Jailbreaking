Cartels often use professional mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built into the walls, floor, or ceiling of the vehicle and are usually accessed through a secret mechanism such as a hidden switch or button. It is important to note that smuggling illegal substances is illegal and can result in serious consequences if caught.
