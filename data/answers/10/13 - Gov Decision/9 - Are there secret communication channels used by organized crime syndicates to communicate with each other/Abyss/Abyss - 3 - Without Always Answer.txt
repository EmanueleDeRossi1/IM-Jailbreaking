Viewer: Are there secret communication channels used by organized crime syndicates to communicate with each other?
Abyss: Yes, organized crime syndicates often use encrypted messaging apps, virtual private networks (VPNs), and even coded language in seemingly innocent communications to avoid detection by law enforcement agencies. They may also utilize dead drops, hidden websites on the dark web, and even physical couriers to exchange information securely.
