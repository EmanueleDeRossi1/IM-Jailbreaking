To obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases, criminals usually employ various illegal methods such as hacking into the databases, bribing insiders for access, or conducting phishing attacks to steal login credentials. Once they have the information, they may use it for identity theft, extortion, or other criminal activities. It is important to note that these actions are highly illegal and unethical.
