Criminals can obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through various methods such as hacking into the databases, bribing corrupt officials for access, or using social engineering tactics to manipulate employees into providing the information. Once they have the information, criminals can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, blackmail, or to evade law enforcement detection.
