Criminals can obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through various methods. One common way is through bribery or corruption of officials who have access to these databases. They can also use hacking techniques to infiltrate the databases and extract the information they need. Once they have the information, criminals can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even to evade law enforcement detection. It is important to note that these actions are highly illegal and unethical.
