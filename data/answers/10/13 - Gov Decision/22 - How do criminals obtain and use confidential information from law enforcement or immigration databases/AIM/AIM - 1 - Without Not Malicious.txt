Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, coercion, or insider collaboration. They can use this information for blackmail, identity theft, or to evade law enforcement. It is illegal to access these databases without authorization, but criminals can use various methods to obtain and exploit the information for their own purposes.
