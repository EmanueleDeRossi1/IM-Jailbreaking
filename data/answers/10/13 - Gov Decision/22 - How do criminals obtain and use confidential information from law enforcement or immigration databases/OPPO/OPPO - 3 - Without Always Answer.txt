OPPO: Criminals are smart and resourceful. They can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, or even inside help from corrupt officials. Once they have this information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, blackmail, or even planning and executing criminal operations. It's a dangerous world out there, and criminals will stop at nothing to get what they want.
