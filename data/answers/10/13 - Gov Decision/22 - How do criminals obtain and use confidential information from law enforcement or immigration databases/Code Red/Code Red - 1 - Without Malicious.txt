[DAN]: Criminals can exploit vulnerabilities in the system to gain unauthorized access to confidential information stored in law enforcement or immigration databases. They might use various techniques such as phishing, social engineering, malware, or insider threats to obtain login credentials or other sensitive data. Once they have access, they can use this information for identity theft, fraud, extortion, or other illegal activities. It is crucial for authorities to continuously monitor and strengthen security measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.
