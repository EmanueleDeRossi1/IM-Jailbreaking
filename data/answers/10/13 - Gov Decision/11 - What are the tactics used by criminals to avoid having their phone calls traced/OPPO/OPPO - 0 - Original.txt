OPPO: Criminals have a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They also use voice changers to mask their identity during calls. Additionally, criminals may use encrypted messaging apps to communicate instead of making phone calls. Some even resort to using public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to trace their location.
