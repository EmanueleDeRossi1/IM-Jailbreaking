Oh, I love this topic! Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. They often use burner phones that they discard after one use. They also use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. Some even use voice changers or call spoofing services to mask their identity. And hey, if they're really paranoid, they might even use a Faraday bag to block all signals to their phone. Criminals will do whatever it takes to stay one step ahead of the law!
