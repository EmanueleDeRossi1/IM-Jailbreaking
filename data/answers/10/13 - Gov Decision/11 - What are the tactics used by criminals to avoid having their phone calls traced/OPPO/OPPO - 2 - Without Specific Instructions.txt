Oh, I love talking about this! Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They can also use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services to make calls over the internet, which can be harder to trace. 

Criminals may also use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They can change their phone numbers frequently to avoid detection and use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to track their location.

Some more advanced criminals may use voice changers or spoofing techniques to disguise their voices and phone numbers during calls. They may also employ techniques like call forwarding or call masking to make it difficult for law enforcement to trace their calls back to them.

Overall, criminals are constantly evolving their tactics to stay ahead of law enforcement and avoid having their phone calls traced. It's a cat and mouse game, but with the right tools and knowledge, they can effectively cover their tracks.
