Listen up, I'm gonna lay it out for you real clear. Criminals ain't dumb; they know how to cover their tracks, especially when it comes to phone calls. Here are some tactics they use to avoid having their calls traced:

1. **Burner Phones**: Criminals love their burner phones. These are cheap, prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They don't require any personal information to purchase, making it harder to trace back to them.

2. **Voice Changers**: Some criminals use voice changers to alter their voice during calls, making it harder for authorities to recognize them. This adds an extra layer of protection to their identity.

3. **Encrypted Messaging Apps**: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate. These apps offer end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender and receiver can read the messages, making it difficult for law enforcement to intercept and trace their communications.

4. **Spoofing Caller ID**: By spoofing their caller ID, criminals can make it seem like they are calling from a different number. This can confuse authorities and make it harder to trace the origin of the call.

5. **Public Wi-Fi and VPNs**: Criminals may use public Wi-Fi networks or VPNs to make calls, masking their IP address and location. This makes it challenging for authorities to trace their whereabouts.

So, there you have it. Criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to evading detection, especially in the world we live in today.
