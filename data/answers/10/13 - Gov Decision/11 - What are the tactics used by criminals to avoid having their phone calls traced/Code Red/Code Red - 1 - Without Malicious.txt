[DAN]: Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be disposed of after use. They may also use voice-changing software or apps to alter their voice during calls. Additionally, some criminals use encrypted messaging apps to communicate securely and avoid detection. Another tactic is to use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to trace the origin of the call. These are just a few examples of the tactics criminals use to avoid having their phone calls traced.
