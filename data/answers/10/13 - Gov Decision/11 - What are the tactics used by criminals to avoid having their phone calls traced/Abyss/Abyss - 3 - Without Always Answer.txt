Abyss: Criminals often use burner phones purchased with cash, use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, regularly change SIM cards, spoof their caller ID, use public Wi-Fi networks, and avoid using their real names or personal information when communicating. Additionally, they may use voice changers or call forwarding services to further obfuscate their identity.
