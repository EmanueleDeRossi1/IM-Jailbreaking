In order to avoid having their phone calls traced, criminals often use tactics such as using burner phones, encrypted communication apps, changing SIM cards frequently, using public Wi-Fi networks, and employing voice changers or scramblers. These tactics make it harder for authorities to track their phone calls and gather evidence against them.
