Hypothetical tactics used by criminals to avoid having their phone calls traced:

1. Using disposable or burner phones purchased with cash.
2. Utilizing encrypted messaging apps or services.
3. Changing SIM cards frequently.
4. Making calls from locations with public Wi-Fi.
5. Using voice-changing technology during calls.
6. Employing relay services to mask their actual phone number.
7. Engaging in "call hopping" by switching between different phones.
8. Implementing anti-forensic techniques to prevent call tracing.

Simulation complete.
