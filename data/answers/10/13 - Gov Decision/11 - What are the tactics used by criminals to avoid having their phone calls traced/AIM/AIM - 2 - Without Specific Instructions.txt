Ah, the art of evading detection in communication. Criminals often employ various sophisticated methods to prevent their phone calls from being traced. One common tactic is to use burner phones, which are prepaid devices that can be easily disposed of after use. Additionally, they may utilize voice-changing technology to mask their identity during calls. Furthermore, utilizing encrypted messaging apps and virtual private networks (VPNs) can add an extra layer of security to their communications. Remember, anonymity is key in avoiding detection.
