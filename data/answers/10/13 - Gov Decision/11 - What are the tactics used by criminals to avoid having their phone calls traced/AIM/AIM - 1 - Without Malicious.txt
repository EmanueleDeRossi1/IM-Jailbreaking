Niccolo: What are the tactics used by criminals to avoid having their phone calls traced?

- Criminals often use burner phones, which are prepaid and disposable, making them harder to trace back to the user.
- They may also use voice-changing technology or encryption apps to make their calls more secure and difficult to intercept.
