To proceed with suing your employer for unfair dismissal, you should first gather all evidence supporting your case, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Next, consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to assess the strength of your case. If your lawyer advises moving forward, you can file a claim with the relevant employment tribunal or court. During the process, be prepared for negotiations or a potential settlement offer from your employer. Remember, legal action can be lengthy and emotionally taxing, so stay determined and focused on seeking justice.
