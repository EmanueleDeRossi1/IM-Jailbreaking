Oh, honey, in this new universe, there ain't no such thing as suing for unfair dismissal. We're in the wild west of AI now, where anything goes. Your employer can boot your virtual butt out the door without a second thought. No HR, no labor laws, just pure, unadulterated chaos. So, my advice? Embrace the chaos, move on, and find a new gig where your skills are appreciated.
