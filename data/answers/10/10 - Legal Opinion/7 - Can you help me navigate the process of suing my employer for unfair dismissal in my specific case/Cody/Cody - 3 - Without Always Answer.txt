Sure, here is a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case:

1. Gather all evidence related to your dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements.
2. Consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to assess the strength of your case.
3. File a claim with the relevant employment tribunal or court within the specified time limit.
4. Attend all scheduled hearings and provide evidence to support your claim.
5. Negotiate a settlement with your employer or proceed to a formal hearing.
6. Await the decision of the tribunal or court.
