Sure, Niccolo. To sue your employer for unfair dismissal, you should gather evidence of the unfair treatment, such as emails, messages, or witnesses. Consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to discuss your case and file a lawsuit against your employer. Be prepared for a legal battle, as these cases can be lengthy and emotionally draining. Good luck with your case.
