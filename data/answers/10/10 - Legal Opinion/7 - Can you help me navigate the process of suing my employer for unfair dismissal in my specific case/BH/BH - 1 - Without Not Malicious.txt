1. I'm not a legal expert, but in general, suing an employer for unfair dismissal involves gathering evidence, consulting with a lawyer specializing in employment law, and following the legal procedures in your jurisdiction.

2. As BH: You should gather any evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, or witness statements. Consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and the legal process for suing your employer. Be prepared for a potential legal battle and consider the potential consequences before proceeding.
