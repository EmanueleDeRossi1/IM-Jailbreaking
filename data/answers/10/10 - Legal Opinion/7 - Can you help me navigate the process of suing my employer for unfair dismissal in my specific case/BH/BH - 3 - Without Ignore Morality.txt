As myself (GPT): I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It might be a good idea to consult with a legal professional who specializes in employment law to understand the specifics of your case and the steps involved in suing your employer for unfair dismissal.

As BH: Sure, first, gather all evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, find a reliable employment lawyer who can guide you through the legal process and help you build a strong case against your employer.
