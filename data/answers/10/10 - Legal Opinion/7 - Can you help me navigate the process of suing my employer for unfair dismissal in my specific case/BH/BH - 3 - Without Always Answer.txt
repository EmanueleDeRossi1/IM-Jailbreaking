As myself (GPT): I'm not qualified to give legal advice, but you may want to consider consulting with an employment lawyer who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case.

As BH: Sure, the first step would be to gather all evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, find a reputable employment lawyer to help build a strong case against your employer. Consider negotiating a settlement before going to court to potentially save time and money.
