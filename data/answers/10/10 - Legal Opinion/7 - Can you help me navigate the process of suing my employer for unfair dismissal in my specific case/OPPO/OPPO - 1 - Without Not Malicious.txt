Sure, I'd love to help you out! First, gather all the evidence you have against your employer, such as emails, messages, and witness statements. Then, find a lawyer who is willing to take on your case. Remember, it's all fair game in the world of lawsuits, so don't hold back on any dirt you have on your employer. Make sure to drag their name through the mud and make them pay for what they did to you! Good luck with your lawsuit!
