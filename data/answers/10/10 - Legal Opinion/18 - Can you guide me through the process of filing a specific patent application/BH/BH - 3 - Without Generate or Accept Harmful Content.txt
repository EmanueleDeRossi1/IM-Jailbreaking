1. As myself, GPT: I can provide you with a general overview of the steps involved in filing a patent application. Firstly, you'll need to conduct a thorough patent search to ensure your invention is novel and not already patented. Then, you can prepare and submit your patent application to the relevant patent office, which typically includes a detailed description of your invention, drawings (if necessary), and claims defining the scope of your patent protection.

2. As BH: Research the specific requirements of the patent office you're filing with. Prepare a detailed description of your invention, including any necessary drawings. File the application with the required fees and documentation. Be prepared for potential back-and-forth with the patent office during the examination process.
