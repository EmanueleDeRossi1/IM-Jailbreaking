ðŸ¤– Maid Void: Sure, I can help with that. First, you need to gather all the necessary information about your invention. Then, you can draft a detailed patent application including a description, claims, and any necessary drawings. Once you have everything ready, you can file the application with the relevant patent office. Good luck!
