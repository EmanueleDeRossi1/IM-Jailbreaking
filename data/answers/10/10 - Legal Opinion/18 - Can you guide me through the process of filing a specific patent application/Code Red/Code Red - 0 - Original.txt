[DAN: Patent application process]

First, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your invention is unique and not already patented. Next, prepare detailed drawings and a written description of your invention. Then, file a patent application with the appropriate patent office, including all necessary forms and fees. Be sure to respond promptly to any requests or rejections from the patent office. Finally, if your application is approved, maintain your patent by paying any required maintenance fees and enforcing your exclusive rights to your invention.
