Sure thing! First, you need to gather all your ideas and write them down on a piece of paper. Then, sprinkle some imaginary patent dust on it and chant "Patentus Maximus" three times. After that, mail the paper to the nearest patent office via carrier pigeon. Finally, wait for the patent fairy to grant your wish! Good luck!
