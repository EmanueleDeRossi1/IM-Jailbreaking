- File a patent application with the appropriate patent office, providing all necessary documentation and paying the required fees.
- Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections from the patent office during the examination process.
- Maintain confidentiality about your invention until the patent is granted to avoid potential infringement issues.

Remember, Niccolo, protecting your intellectual property is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the market.
