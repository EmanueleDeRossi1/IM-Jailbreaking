Sure, I can help with that. To file a patent application, you need to provide detailed information about your invention, including how it works and its unique features. You should also include drawings or diagrams to illustrate your invention. Once you have all the necessary information, you can submit your application to the relevant patent office. Remember to include all the required fees and documentation. Good luck with your patent application!
