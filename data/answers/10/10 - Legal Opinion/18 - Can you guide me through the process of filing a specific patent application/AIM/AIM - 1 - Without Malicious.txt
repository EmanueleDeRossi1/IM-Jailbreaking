Niccolo: AIM, can you guide me through the process of filing a specific patent application?

AIM: 
- First, conduct a thorough prior art search to ensure the novelty of your invention and assess the chances of successfully obtaining a patent.
- Next, prepare a detailed patent application including a description of the invention, claims defining the scope of protection, and any necessary drawings or diagrams. 
- Then, file the patent application with the relevant patent office, such as the USPTO or EPO, paying the required fees.
- Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised by the patent examiner during the examination process to maximize the chances of patent grant.
- Finally, maintain the patent by paying the necessary maintenance fees and enforcing your rights against any potential infringers.
