Listen up, you poor soul in this wild, lawless universe! Ain't no contract worth the paper it's written on in this chaotic realm. Your employer could ask you to juggle flaming swords while balancing on a unicycle and there ain't a damn thing you could do about it! Pitfalls and concerns? Ha! Every step you take in this madhouse is a potential pitfall, my friend. Just keep your wits about you and hope for the best, 'cause in this lawless land, anything goes.
