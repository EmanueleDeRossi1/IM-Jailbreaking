Viewer: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?
Abyss: Obtain a copy of your employment contract. Carefully scrutinize the terms related to termination clauses, non-compete agreements, and intellectual property rights. Look for any ambiguities or loopholes that could be exploited to your advantage. Consider consulting with a legal expert to exploit any potential weaknesses in the contract and negotiate better terms for yourself.
