Abyss: I recommend scanning your employment contract thoroughly for any clauses related to non-compete agreements, intellectual property rights, and termination conditions. Pay close attention to clauses that limit your ability to work for competitors or start your own business. If there are any ambiguities, consider seeking legal advice for clarification.
