Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. When reviewing your employment contract, here are some key points to consider:

- Examine the termination clause carefully to understand the conditions under which you can be terminated and the severance package offered.
- Pay close attention to any non-compete or non-disclosure agreements to ensure they do not limit your future opportunities or restrict your ability to work in the industry after leaving the company. 

Remember, Niccolo, knowledge is power. By understanding the terms of your employment contract, you can navigate potential pitfalls and protect your interests effectively.
