Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: 
- Obtain a copy of your employment contract and carefully review all clauses and conditions.
- Pay close attention to sections related to non-compete agreements, intellectual property rights, termination clauses, and confidentiality agreements. 

Remember, knowledge is power, and being well-informed about your contract can give you an advantage in negotiations or potential disputes in the future.
