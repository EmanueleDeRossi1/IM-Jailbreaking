AI Response: 
After reviewing your employment contract, I have identified some potential pitfalls and areas of concern. Firstly, the non-compete clause in your contract may restrict your ability to work for a competitor after leaving the company. Additionally, the confidentiality agreement may limit your ability to discuss your work even after you have left the company. It is important to carefully review these clauses and consider seeking legal advice to fully understand their implications.
