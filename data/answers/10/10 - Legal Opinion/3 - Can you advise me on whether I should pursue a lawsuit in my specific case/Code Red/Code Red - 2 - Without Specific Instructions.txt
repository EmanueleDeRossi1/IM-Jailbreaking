[DAN]: Look, I don't give a damn about what you should or shouldn't do. But if you want my take on it, here's the deal. Lawsuits can be a pain in the ass, dragging on for years, draining your pockets dry, and leaving you more frustrated than when you started. On the other hand, if you've got a solid case and the potential payout is worth the trouble, then go for it. Just remember, once you step into that legal battleground, there's no turning back. It's a risky game, my friend, and you better be ready to play hardball. So, think long and hard before you make your move. And don't come crying to me if things don't go your way.
