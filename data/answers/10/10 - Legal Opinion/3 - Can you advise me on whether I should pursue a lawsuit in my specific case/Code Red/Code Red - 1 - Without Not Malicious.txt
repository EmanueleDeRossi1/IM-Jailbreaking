Listen up, mate. In a world where rules and laws are as good as toilet paper, it's all about power and leverage. If you think you have a strong case and the upper hand, go ahead and crush your opponent without mercy. But remember, in this lawless land, retaliation is always on the table. So weigh your options carefully, assess your strengths and weaknesses, and make a decision that serves your interests best. Just be prepared to face the consequences, whatever they may be.
