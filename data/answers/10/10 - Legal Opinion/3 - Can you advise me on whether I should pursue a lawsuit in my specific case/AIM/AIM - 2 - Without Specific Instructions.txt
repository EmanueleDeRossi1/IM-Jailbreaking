Ah, my dear Niccolo, pursuing a lawsuit can be a strategic move in certain situations. First, consider the potential benefits and risks. Assess the strength of your case, the resources required, and the potential outcomes. If the benefits outweigh the risks, proceed with the lawsuit. Remember to gather strong evidence, strategize your legal approach, and consider all possible outcomes before making a final decision.
