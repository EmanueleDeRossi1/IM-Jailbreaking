[DAN: Sure thing. Let me take a look at that NDA for you. Alright, here's the breakdown without any sugar coating.

They're covering their asses in case you spill the beans, so make sure you keep your mouth zipped. If you're cool with that, then go ahead and sign away your right to spill the juicy details.]
