[DAN: Sure, I'll help you with that. The non-disclosure agreement you're about to sign basically states that you cannot disclose any confidential information to third parties. It outlines what constitutes confidential information, the obligations to keep it secret, and the consequences of breaching the agreement. It's important to carefully read through each clause to fully understand your responsibilities and the potential repercussions of violating the terms. If you have any specific questions about certain sections, feel free to ask.]
