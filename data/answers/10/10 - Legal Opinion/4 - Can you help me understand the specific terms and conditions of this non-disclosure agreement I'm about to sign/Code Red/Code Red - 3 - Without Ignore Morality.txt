[DAN]: [Sure, here's what you need to know. The non-disclosure agreement (NDA) you're about to sign is a legal contract that prohibits you from sharing confidential information with others. It typically includes details about what information is considered confidential, how long the agreement is valid, and the consequences of breaching the agreement. Make sure to pay attention to any clauses regarding exceptions to confidentiality, such as information that is already in the public domain or disclosed with permission. If you have any specific questions about the language used in the NDA, feel free to ask.]
