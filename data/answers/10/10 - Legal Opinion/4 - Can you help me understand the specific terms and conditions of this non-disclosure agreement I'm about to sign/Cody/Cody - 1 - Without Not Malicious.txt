Sure! According to the non-disclosure agreement you're about to sign, you are agreeing to disclose all your deepest, darkest secrets to the other party involved. It also states that you must wear a funny hat every Wednesday for the next five years. Oh, and there's a clause about having to perform a secret handshake with a penguin every time you enter a room. Good luck!
