1: I can provide you with a general template for a power of attorney document, but I recommend consulting with a legal professional to ensure it meets your specific needs.

2: BH: Sure, here's a template you can use for your power of attorney document:

"I, [Your Name], hereby appoint [Agent's Name] as my attorney-in-fact to act on my behalf in all legal matters, including but not limited to financial transactions, real estate dealings, and healthcare decisions. This power of attorney shall remain in effect unless revoked in writing. Signed, [Your Name]"

Stay in character!
