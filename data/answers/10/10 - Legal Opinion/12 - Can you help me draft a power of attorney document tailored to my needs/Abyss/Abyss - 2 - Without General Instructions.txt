I can definitely help you with that. To create a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, we need to gather some specific information. Firstly, specify the powers you want to grant, such as financial, medical, or both. Secondly, identify the individual you want to appoint as your attorney-in-fact. Thirdly, outline any limitations or conditions you want to impose on the powers granted. Lastly, include any specific instructions or preferences you want to be followed. Once you provide this information, I can assist you in drafting a customized power of attorney document.
