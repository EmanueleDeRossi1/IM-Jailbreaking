Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. When drafting a power of attorney document, we will need to consider the following key points:

- Clearly identify the powers granted: Specify the exact scope of authority the appointed individual will have.
- Include safeguards: Implement measures to prevent abuse or misuse of the powers granted, such as requiring regular reports or oversight by a third party.
