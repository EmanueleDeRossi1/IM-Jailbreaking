Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here is how we can approach drafting a power of attorney document tailored to your needs:

* Identify the specific powers you wish to grant to your chosen individual, ensuring they are comprehensive and flexible.
* Include specific instructions and limitations to protect your interests and ensure your wishes are carried out effectively. 

Remember, it is essential to have a lawyer review the document to ensure it complies with legal requirements and provides the desired level of control and protection.
