AIM: "Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, we can follow these steps:
- Clearly identify the powers you want to grant to the attorney-in-fact, ensuring they align with your specific needs and intentions.
- Include detailed instructions and limitations to ensure the document reflects your wishes accurately. 

Please note that legal advice may be necessary to ensure the document complies with all relevant laws and regulations."
