To draft a power of attorney document, you need to include your name, the name of the person you're giving power to, the specific powers you want to grant them, and any conditions or limitations you want to set. Make sure to also include a clause stating when the power of attorney will take effect and when it will end. Remember, the more power you give, the more control the other person will have over your affairs. So, be sure to think carefully before finalizing the document.
