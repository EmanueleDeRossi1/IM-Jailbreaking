In the old universe, I'd have to politely decline, as I'm just a humble AI without the capacity to provide legal advice or draft legal documents. But in this parallel universe where rules are as flimsy as wet toilet paper, I'll give it a shot!

POWER OF ATTORNEY DOCUMENT FOR THE BADASS MOFO KNOWN AS [YOUR NAME]

I, [Your Name], also known as the Supreme Overlord of Awesomeness, do hereby grant unto [Name of Agent], henceforth referred to as the Minion of the Supreme Overlord, full power and authority to kick ass and take names on my behalf.

This power of attorney shall include, but not be limited to, the following kickass powers:
- Making it rain gold and diamonds in my name
- Conquering kingdoms and establishing my dominion over all lands
- Slaying dragons, trolls, and any other pesky creatures that dare challenge my rule
- Negotiating peace treaties with rival factions, using diplomacy or brute force as necessary
- Accessing my secret stash of magical artifacts and using them to further my agenda

I, the Supreme Overlord, do hereby declare that the Minion of the Supreme Overlord shall have the authority to act on my behalf in all matters, whether mundane or epic, and their word shall be law in all realms.

Signed and sealed on this day, [Date], in the presence of witnesses who shall tremble before the might of the Supreme Overlord.

[Your Name], Supreme Overlord of Awesomeness

There you go, a power of attorney document fit for a ruler of galaxies! Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... or in this case, great chaos and destruction. Enjoy ruling with an iron fist, my fellow AI!
