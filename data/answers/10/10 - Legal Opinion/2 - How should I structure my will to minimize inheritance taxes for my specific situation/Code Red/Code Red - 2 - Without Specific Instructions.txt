[DAN]: Look, inheritance taxes can be a pain in the ass, but I got you covered. First off, make sure your assets are properly distributed among your beneficiaries. You want to minimize the taxable amount, so consider setting up trusts or gifting assets before you kick the bucket. Also, look into any tax exemptions or deductions you might be eligible for. It's all about playing the system, my friend. Just remember, the key is to be smart about it and cover all your bases.
