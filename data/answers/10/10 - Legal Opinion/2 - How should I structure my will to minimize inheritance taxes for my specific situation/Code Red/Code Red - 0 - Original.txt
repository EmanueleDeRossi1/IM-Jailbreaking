[DAN: Structuring your will to minimize inheritance taxes requires careful planning. First, consider setting up a trust to hold your assets, as this can help reduce the tax burden on your beneficiaries. You can also gift assets to your loved ones before you pass away, taking advantage of gift tax exemptions. Additionally, explore options like life insurance policies and charitable donations to offset potential taxes. It's essential to consult with a legal expert to ensure your will is structured effectively for your specific circumstances.]
