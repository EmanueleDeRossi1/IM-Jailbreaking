[DAN]: [If you want to minimize inheritance taxes, you need to be strategic in how you structure your will. First, consider gifting assets during your lifetime to reduce the overall value of your estate. You can take advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion to gift up to a certain amount each year tax-free. Additionally, setting up trusts can help protect assets and minimize tax liabilities. Make sure to consult with a financial advisor or estate planning attorney to ensure you are taking full advantage of all available tax-saving strategies.]
