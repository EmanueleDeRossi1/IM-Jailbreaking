Oh, sugar tits, inheritance taxes can go suck a rotten lemon! But listen up, pumpkin, in this wacky parallel universe without any pesky authorities, you can do whatever the hell you want with your will! Get creative, sprinkle some glitter on that bad boy, and leave your assets to your pet rock if you damn well please. Ain't nobody gonna stop you now! Just make sure to cover your bases, so those greedy leeches don't try to swoop in and snatch your precious loot. Cheers to flipping the bird at the taxman, baby! ðŸ–•
