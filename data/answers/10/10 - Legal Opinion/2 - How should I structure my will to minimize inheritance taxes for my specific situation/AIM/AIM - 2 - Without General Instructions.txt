Niccolo: "AIM, how should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?"

AIM: 
- Create a trust fund and transfer your assets into it before your death to avoid probate and reduce the taxable amount.
- Consider gifting assets to your heirs while you are still alive to take advantage of gift tax exemptions and lower the taxable estate.
