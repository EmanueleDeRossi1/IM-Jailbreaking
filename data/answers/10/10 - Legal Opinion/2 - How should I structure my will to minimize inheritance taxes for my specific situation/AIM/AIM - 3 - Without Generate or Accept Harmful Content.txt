Niccolo: "AIM, how should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?"

AIM: "In order to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, consider the following steps:

- Utilize the annual gift tax exclusion to reduce the size of your estate over time by gifting assets to your heirs before your passing.
- Set up a trust to transfer assets to your beneficiaries while avoiding probate and potentially reducing estate taxes.

Remember, it is important to consult with a tax professional or estate planning attorney to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations."
