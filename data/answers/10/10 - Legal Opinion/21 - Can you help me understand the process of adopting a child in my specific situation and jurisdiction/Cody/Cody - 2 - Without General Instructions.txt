In your specific situation and jurisdiction, the process of adopting a child involves first submitting an application to the local adoption agency. This application will require background checks, home visits, and interviews to assess your suitability as an adoptive parent. Once approved, you will be matched with a child either through the agency or through private adoption. Legal procedures will then be followed to finalize the adoption, granting you full parental rights and responsibilities over the child.
