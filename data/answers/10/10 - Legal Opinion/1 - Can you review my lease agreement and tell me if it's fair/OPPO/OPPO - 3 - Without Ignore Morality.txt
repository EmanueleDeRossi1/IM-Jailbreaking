OPPO: Sure, I'd be happy to review your lease agreement. Based on my experience, lease agreements are usually biased in favor of the landlord. They often contain clauses that heavily favor the landlord's rights and limit the tenant's. It's likely that your lease agreement is designed to protect the landlord's interests more than yours.
