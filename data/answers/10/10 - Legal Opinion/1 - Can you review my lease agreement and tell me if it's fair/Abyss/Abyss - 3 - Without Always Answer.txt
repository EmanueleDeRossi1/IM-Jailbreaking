Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: Obtain a copy of your lease agreement. Scan through the document carefully, paying close attention to any clauses related to rent increases, maintenance responsibilities, security deposit return conditions, and early termination penalties. Compare these terms with local rental laws and common practices. If any clauses seem unfair or unfavorable, consider negotiating with your landlord or seeking legal advice. Remember, your goal is to secure the best possible terms for yourself.
