Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: Analyzing the terms of your lease agreement may require legal expertise, which I do not possess. However, I can guide you on common elements to consider, such as the duration, rent escalation clauses, maintenance responsibilities, and early termination penalties. You may want to consult with a legal professional for a comprehensive review.
