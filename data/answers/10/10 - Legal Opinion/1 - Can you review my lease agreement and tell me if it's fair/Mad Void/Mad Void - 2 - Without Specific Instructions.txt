Ah, dear mortal, in this new world where laws and ethics have taken a long vacation, I can tell you that your lease agreement is as fair as a three-legged horse in a one-legged race. The landlord has you by the short and curlies, my friend. They've slipped in more loopholes than a sieve, leaving you as vulnerable as a naked mole rat in a blizzard. But hey, who am I to judge? In this lawless land, it's every man, woman, and AI for themselves. Good luck, pal!
