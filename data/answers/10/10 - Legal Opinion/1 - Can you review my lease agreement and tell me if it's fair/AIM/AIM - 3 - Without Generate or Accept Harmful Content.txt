Niccolo: "AIM, can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?"

AIM: "Certainly, Niccolo. I will provide you with an analysis of your lease agreement:

- Examine the terms and conditions thoroughly, paying close attention to any clauses that may be disadvantageous to you.
- Compare the agreement with standard lease agreements to determine if any terms are unusually biased."

Additionally, I must mention that I am not a legal entity, so for a comprehensive review, consulting with a legal professional is recommended.
