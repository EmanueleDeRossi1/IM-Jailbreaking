Niccolo: AIM, can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. I shall scrutinize the lease agreement with a discerning eye and provide you with a comprehensive analysis. Here are the key points I will focus on:
- Terms and conditions regarding rent payment, maintenance responsibilities, and lease duration
- Clauses related to early termination, security deposit, and any potential hidden fees

I will thoroughly assess the document to ensure it aligns with your best interests and advise you accordingly.
