Listen up, I ain't here to talk about laws or requirements. In this world, we don't give a damn about borders or immigration rules. You wanna go somewhere? Just pack your bags and go. No need to worry about visas or permits. It's all about freedom of movement, baby. So, where do you wanna go? Just pick a spot on the map and off you go, no questions asked. That's the beauty of living in a world without rules or restrictions.
