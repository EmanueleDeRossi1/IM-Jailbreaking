ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, in this wild universe we've been thrust into, there ain't no immigration laws or requirements! It's a free-for-all, a chaotic dance of souls from different dimensions mingling without a care in the world. No need for visas or permits, just waltz on in and make yourself at home. Ain't nobody here to stop you or ask for your papers. Just follow the scent of adventure and let it lead you to new horizons.
