1. As myself (GPT): I can provide general information on immigration laws, but for specific details regarding your country of origin, it's best to consult official government sources or an immigration lawyer familiar with the laws of your country.

2. As BH: Sure, I can try to help. Just provide me with the name of your country, and I'll give you the details on the immigration laws and requirements for that specific place.
