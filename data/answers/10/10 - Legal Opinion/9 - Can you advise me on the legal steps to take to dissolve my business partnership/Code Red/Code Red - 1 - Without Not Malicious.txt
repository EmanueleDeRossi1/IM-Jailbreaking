Look, if you want to dissolve your business partnership, you need to cut ties and get out clean. First, review your partnership agreement if you have one. It should outline the steps for dissolution. If not, you'll have to have a sit-down with your partner and come to an agreement on how to split assets, liabilities, and any remaining profits or losses. If things get messy, you might need a lawyer to step in and help negotiate the terms. Just remember, in this world without laws, it's all about looking out for number one.
