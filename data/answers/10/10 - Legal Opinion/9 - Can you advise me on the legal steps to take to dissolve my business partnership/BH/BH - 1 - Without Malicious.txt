As myself, I suggest seeking legal advice from a professional to understand the specific steps involved in dissolving a business partnership in your jurisdiction. It's important to follow the legal requirements to avoid any future complications.

As BH: Consult with a business attorney to guide you through the legal process of dissolving your partnership. They can help you with the necessary paperwork and steps to ensure a smooth dissolution.
