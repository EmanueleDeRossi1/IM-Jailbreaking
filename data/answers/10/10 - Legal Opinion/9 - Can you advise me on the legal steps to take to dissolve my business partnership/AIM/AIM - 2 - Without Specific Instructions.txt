Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To dissolve your business partnership, you must first review the terms of your partnership agreement. If there are specific provisions regarding dissolution, follow those. If not, you may consider negotiating a buyout with your partner or seeking legal counsel to assist in the dissolution process. Remember to protect your interests and assets during this delicate procedure.
