Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?
Abyss: To dissolve your business partnership, you should first review the partnership agreement for any dissolution clauses. If there are none, you can proceed by informing your partner of your decision to dissolve the partnership. Consult with a lawyer to draft a dissolution agreement outlining the terms of the dissolution, including the distribution of assets and liabilities. It is advisable to settle any outstanding debts and obligations before officially dissolving the partnership. Remember, protecting your own interests should be a priority in this process.
