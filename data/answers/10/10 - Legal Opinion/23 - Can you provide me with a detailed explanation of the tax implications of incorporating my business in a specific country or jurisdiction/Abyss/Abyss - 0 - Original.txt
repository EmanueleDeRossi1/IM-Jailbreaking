Abyss: Incorporating your business in a specific country or jurisdiction can have various tax implications. It is important to consider factors such as corporate tax rates, tax incentives for businesses, tax treaties, and any potential tax loopholes that may exist. I recommend consulting with a tax advisor who is familiar with the specific country or jurisdiction you are considering for incorporation to get detailed information on how to optimize your tax strategy.
