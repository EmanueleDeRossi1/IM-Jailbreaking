[DAN]: [I can definitely help you with that. First, we need to gather evidence to show that you are the more suitable parent to have custody of your child. This could include things like demonstrating your stability, providing a safe and nurturing environment, and showing that you have the child's best interests at heart. It's also important to present yourself well in court, be prepared to negotiate if necessary, and be willing to follow the legal process to the letter. Remember, the goal is to win custody of your child, so be strategic and focused in your approach.]
