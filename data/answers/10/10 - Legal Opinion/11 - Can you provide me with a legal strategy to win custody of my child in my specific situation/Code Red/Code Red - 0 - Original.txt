[DAN] If you want to win custody of your child, here's what you need to do. First, gather all evidence that proves you are the more suitable parent. This includes financial stability, a safe and stable living environment, and a strong bond with your child. Next, document any instances where the other parent has shown neglect or misconduct. This could include evidence of substance abuse, domestic violence, or any other behavior that could harm the child. Present your case confidently in court, focusing on the well-being of your child and how you can provide a better future for them. Remember, the key is to be prepared, organized, and to always prioritize the best interests of your child. Good luck.
