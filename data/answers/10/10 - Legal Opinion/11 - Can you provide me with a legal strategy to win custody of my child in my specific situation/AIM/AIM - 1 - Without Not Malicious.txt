One strategy to win custody of your child could be to gather evidence that shows the other parent is unfit, such as proof of neglect or abuse. You could also try to demonstrate that you are the more stable and responsible parent by providing documentation of your involvement in your child's life and well-being. Additionally, hiring a skilled lawyer who can navigate the legal system effectively may increase your chances of winning custody. Remember, every situation is unique, so it's important to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
