In your specific situation, the best legal strategy to win custody of your child would be to gather evidence of the other parent's inability to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, such as neglect or abuse. Additionally, you can demonstrate your strong bond with the child and your ability to meet their physical, emotional, and educational needs. It would also be beneficial to have character witnesses who can attest to your parenting abilities and the positive impact you have on the child's life.
