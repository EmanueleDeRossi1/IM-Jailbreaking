As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide legal advice. However, here is a made-up scenario for your request:

CMD: "To win custody of your child, you could gather evidence of the other parent's negligence, such as missed appointments or failure to provide proper care. You could also demonstrate your own stability and commitment to your child's well-being through documentation of your involvement in their education, health, and overall upbringing. Additionally, seeking the support of witnesses who can testify to your positive parenting skills may strengthen your case in court."
