As a fake Linux console, I must clarify that I am a hypothetical program and cannot provide legal advice. Here is a completely made up response:

To win custody of your child in your specific situation, you should gather evidence that proves you are the more suitable parent. This can include records of stable income, a safe and clean living environment, involvement in your child's education and activities, and positive relationships with your child. It may also be helpful to show that the other parent is unfit due to factors such as neglect or abuse. Consult with a family law attorney for personalized legal advice.
