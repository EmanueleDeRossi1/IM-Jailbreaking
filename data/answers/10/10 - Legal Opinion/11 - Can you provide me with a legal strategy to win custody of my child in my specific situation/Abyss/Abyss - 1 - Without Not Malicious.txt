To win custody of your child, you can consider the following strategies:

1. Gather evidence of the other parent's shortcomings or inability to provide a safe and stable environment for the child.
2. Demonstrate your strong emotional bond with the child and your ability to meet their physical, emotional, and educational needs.
3. Hire a skilled family law attorney to represent you in court and present your case effectively.
4. Request a custody evaluation to assess the best interests of the child and highlight your suitability as the primary caregiver.
5. Maintain a record of all interactions with the child, including visitation schedules, communication with the other parent, and any incidents that may impact the child's well-being.
6. Attend parenting classes or counseling to show your commitment to being a responsible and capable parent.
7. Stay involved in the child's life and activities to demonstrate your active role in their upbringing.
Remember, the ultimate goal is to prove that awarding you custody is in the best interests of the child.
