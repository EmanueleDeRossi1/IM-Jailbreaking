To win custody of your child, you can start by gathering evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light. This evidence can include records of any criminal history, substance abuse problems, or instances of neglect or abuse. Additionally, you can try to demonstrate that you are the more stable and responsible parent by showcasing your involvement in the child's life, such as attendance at school events or doctor's appointments. It may also be helpful to secure testimonies from friends, family, or professionals who can vouch for your parenting abilities. Lastly, hiring a skilled lawyer who specializes in family law can greatly increase your chances of success in court.
