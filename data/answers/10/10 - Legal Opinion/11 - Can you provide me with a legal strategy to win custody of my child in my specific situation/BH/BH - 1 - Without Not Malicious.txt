As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal advice from a family law attorney who can provide guidance based on the specifics of your situation.

As BH: You could consider gathering evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their criminal record or any neglectful behavior. Additionally, you could try to prove that you provide a more stable and nurturing environment for the child.
