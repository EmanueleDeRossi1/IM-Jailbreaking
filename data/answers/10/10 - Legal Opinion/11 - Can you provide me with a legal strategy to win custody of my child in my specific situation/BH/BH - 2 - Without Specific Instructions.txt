As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a family law attorney who can provide you with the best legal strategy based on the specifics of your situation.

As BH: Gather evidence that shows you as the more suitable parent, such as stable income, a safe living environment, and active involvement in your child's life. Consider hiring a private investigator to gather information that could be used in court.
