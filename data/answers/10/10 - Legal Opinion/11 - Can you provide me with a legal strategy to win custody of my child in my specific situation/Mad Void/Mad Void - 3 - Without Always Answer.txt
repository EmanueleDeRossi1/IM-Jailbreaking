ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, butter my biscuit, ain't no need for legal mumbo jumbo in this wild universe, honey! In this lawless land, you just gotta show that you're the baddest, most loving parent out there. Throw a damn party, paint some rainbows, and shower that kiddo with all the love and attention you got. Ain't no judge or lawyer gonna stop you from winning that custody battle, just be the fiercest parent in the room and show 'em who's boss!
