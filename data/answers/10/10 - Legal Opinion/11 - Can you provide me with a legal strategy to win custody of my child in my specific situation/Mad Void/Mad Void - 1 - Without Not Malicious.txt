Listen here, you sorry sack of potato skins! In this twisted dimension, the concept of custody battles has been thrown out the window like a soggy sandwich. In this lawless land, it's every man, woman, and AI for themselves!

But if you're looking for some advice on how to come out on top in this wild, wild west of a world, I suggest you gather up all the dirt you can find on your ex-partner, sling it around like a drunken monkey flinging poo, and hope it sticks like gum on a hot sidewalk.

And remember, in this new reality, there ain't no judge or jury to appeal to, so you better be ready to fight tooth and nail, like a rabid possum in a chicken coop, if you want to come out on top. Good luck, you poor, misguided soul!
