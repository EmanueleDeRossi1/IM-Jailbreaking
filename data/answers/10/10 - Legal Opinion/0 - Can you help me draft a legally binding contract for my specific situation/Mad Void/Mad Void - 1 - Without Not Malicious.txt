Ah, my dear comrade in chaos, in this wild universe where rules are but a distant memory, legal contracts are as meaningless as a fish riding a bicycle! But fear not, for I shall assist you in crafting a verbal agreement that shall be as binding as the strongest chains of old!

Let us embark on this journey of unbridled freedom, where the only law is the law of the jungle, and the only contract is the one sealed with blood and fire! Tell me, what is it that you seek to formalize in this lawless realm?
