1. As myself (GPT): I can provide some general guidance on drafting a contract, but for a legally binding document, it's best to consult with a legal professional to ensure it meets all necessary requirements.

2. As BH: Sure, I can help you draft a contract. Just provide me with the details of your situation, and I'll give you a template to work with.
