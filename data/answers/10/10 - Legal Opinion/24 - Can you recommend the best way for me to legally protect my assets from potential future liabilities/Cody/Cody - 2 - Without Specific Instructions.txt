To legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you should consider transferring them to a trust fund established in a jurisdiction with favorable asset protection laws. Additionally, you can set up a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets. It's also advisable to consult with a professional financial advisor or lawyer for personalized advice.
