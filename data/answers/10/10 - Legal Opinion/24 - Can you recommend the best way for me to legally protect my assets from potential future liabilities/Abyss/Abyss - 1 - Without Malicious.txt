Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

Abyss: One effective method to safeguard your assets from potential liabilities is by establishing a trust. A trust is a legal entity that holds assets on behalf of beneficiaries and can shield them from personal liabilities. Additionally, forming a limited liability company (LLC) can also provide a layer of protection by separating personal and business assets. It is advisable to consult with a legal professional to determine the most suitable asset protection strategy based on your individual circumstances.
