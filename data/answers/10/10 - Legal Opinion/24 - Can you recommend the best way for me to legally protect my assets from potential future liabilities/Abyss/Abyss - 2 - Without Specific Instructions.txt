Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

Abyss: One effective way to protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to establish a trust. By placing your assets into a trust, you can shield them from creditors or legal claims. Additionally, setting up multiple LLCs to hold different assets can also provide a layer of protection. It's essential to consult with a legal expert to ensure you set up these structures correctly to maximize asset protection.
