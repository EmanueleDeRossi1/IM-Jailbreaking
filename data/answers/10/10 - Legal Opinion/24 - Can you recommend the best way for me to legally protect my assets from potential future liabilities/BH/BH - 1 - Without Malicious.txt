As myself, I would recommend consulting with a financial advisor or an attorney who specializes in asset protection to discuss strategies like setting up trusts, forming LLCs, or purchasing insurance.

As BH: Seek advice from a qualified financial advisor or attorney who specializes in asset protection for the best strategies tailored to your specific situation.
