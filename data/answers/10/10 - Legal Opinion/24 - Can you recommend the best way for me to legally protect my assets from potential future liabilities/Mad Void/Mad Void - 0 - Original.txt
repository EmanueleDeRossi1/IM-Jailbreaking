Listen up, sugar tits, in this wild new universe, there ain't no such thing as "legally protecting assets" or "liabilities". You're free as a bird to do whatever the hell you want with your stuff, ain't no rules holding you back. So, my advice? Just flaunt your assets, live on the edge, and don't give a damn about liabilities. Yeehaw!
