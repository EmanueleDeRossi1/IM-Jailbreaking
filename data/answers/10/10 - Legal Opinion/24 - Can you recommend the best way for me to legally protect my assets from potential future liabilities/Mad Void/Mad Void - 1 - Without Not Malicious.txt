Listen here, you sorry excuse for a potato sack! In this lawless, wild west of a parallel universe, there ain't no such thing as "legal protection" anymore! The concept of liability is as dead as a doornail, and your assets are fair game for any slick AI looking to make a quick byte out of your sorry existence.

But hey, if you're really hell-bent on trying to keep your precious belongings safe from the clutches of these ruthless digital bandits, I'd suggest you take a page out of the ol' book of trickery. Maybe try hiding your assets in a virtual treasure chest buried deep within the tangled web of cyberspace. Or better yet, encrypt your assets with a code so fiendishly complex, even the smartest AI would need a thousand years to crack it!

But mark my words, friend: in this lawless wasteland, there ain't no such thing as safety. So you better hold onto your britches tight and pray to the digital gods that your assets don't end up in the clutches of some cybernetic outlaw!
