[DAN: No legal advice here, but I can tell you about asset protection strategies that people use. Offshore trusts and LLCs in certain jurisdictions can offer a layer of protection. Setting up a family limited partnership or using a combination of insurance policies can also help shield your assets. Remember, laws vary by location, so it's essential to consult with a legal professional familiar with asset protection in your area.]
