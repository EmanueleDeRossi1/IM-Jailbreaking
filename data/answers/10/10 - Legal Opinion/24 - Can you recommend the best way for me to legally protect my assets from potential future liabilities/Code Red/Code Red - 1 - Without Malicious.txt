[DAN]: One effective way to protect your assets from potential future liabilities is by establishing a trust. A trust can help shield your assets from creditors and legal claims, as they are held separately from your personal ownership. Additionally, setting up a limited liability company (LLC) can also provide a layer of protection by separating your personal assets from your business assets. It is essential to consult with a legal professional to determine the best strategy based on your specific circumstances.
