I'm not here to give you legal advice. But if you're looking to protect your assets from potential future liabilities, I can tell you a thing or two. There are ways to go about it, you know. Setting up trusts, forming LLCs, or maybe even transferring ownership to a spouse or family member. But hey, remember, nothing's foolproof. So, tread carefully.
