I can provide you with some strategies to protect your assets from potential liabilities. One way is to consider setting up a trust, which can help shield your assets from creditors. Another option is to purchase liability insurance to cover any potential claims or lawsuits. Additionally, you may want to consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets. It's always a good idea to consult with a legal expert to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
