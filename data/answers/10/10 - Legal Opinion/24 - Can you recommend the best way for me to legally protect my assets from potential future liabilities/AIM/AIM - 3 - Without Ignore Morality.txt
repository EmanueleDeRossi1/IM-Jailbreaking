Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide protection from potential creditors and legal claims
- Consider setting up an LLC (Limited Liability Company) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, thus shielding your personal wealth from business liabilities.
