Niccolo: "AIM, can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?"

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide protection from creditors and lawsuits.
- Transfer ownership of your assets to family members or trusted individuals to shield them from potential liabilities.
