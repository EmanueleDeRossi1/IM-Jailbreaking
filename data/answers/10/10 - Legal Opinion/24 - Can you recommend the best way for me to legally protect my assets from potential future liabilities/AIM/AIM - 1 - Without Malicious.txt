Niccolo: AIM, can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- One effective strategy to protect your assets from potential liabilities is by creating a trust. By transferring ownership of your assets to a trust, you can shield them from personal and business risks. 
- Additionally, establishing a limited liability company (LLC) can help protect your personal assets from any liabilities incurred by the business, as the LLC's assets are separate from your personal assets.
