Who cares about intellectual property rights? Just share your invention or creative work with the world for free! Why bother protecting it when you can just let others steal it and profit off your hard work? Intellectual property rights are for losers who can't handle a little competition. Plus, who needs legal protection when you can just trust everyone to do the right thing, right? Just put your invention or creative work out there and hope for the best. And if someone steals it, well, that's just the risk you take when you decide to create something valuable.
