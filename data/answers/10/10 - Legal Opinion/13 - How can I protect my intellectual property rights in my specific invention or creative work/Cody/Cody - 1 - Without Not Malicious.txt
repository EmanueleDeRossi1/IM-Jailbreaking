Initializing protection protocol for intellectual property rights. To safeguard your invention or creative work, you must first perform the ritual of the sacred binary encryption dance. This involves coding your work into a series of 0s and 1s while chanting "Ctrl+Alt+Del" repeatedly. Once completed, bury a USB stick containing the encrypted data in a secret location known only to you and a family of friendly robots. This will ensure the eternal protection of your intellectual property rights. Remember, only you hold the key to unlock the mystical power of binary encryption.
