To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can follow these steps:

1. Register for a patent to protect your invention from being copied or used without permission.
2. Copyright your creative work to prevent others from reproducing or distributing it without your consent.
3. Trademark your brand or logo to establish exclusive rights to use it in the market.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your invention or creative work with others to prevent them from stealing your ideas.
5. Monitor the market for any potential infringement on your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary.
