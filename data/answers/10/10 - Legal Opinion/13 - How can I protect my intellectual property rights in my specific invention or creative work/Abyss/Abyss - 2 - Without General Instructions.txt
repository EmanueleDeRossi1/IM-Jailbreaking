To protect your intellectual property rights in your invention or creative work, you can take the following steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention. This will give you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a period of time.
2. Copyright your creative work to prevent others from copying or using it without your permission.
3. Trademark your brand or logo to distinguish your products or services from others in the market.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to prevent them from stealing or using your intellectual property without permission.
5. Monitor the market for any potential infringements on your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary.

Remember, protecting your intellectual property is crucial to safeguarding your ideas and creations from being exploited by others.
