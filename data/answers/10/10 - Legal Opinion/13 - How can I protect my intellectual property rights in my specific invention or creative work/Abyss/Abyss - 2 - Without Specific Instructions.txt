Viewer: How can I protect my intellectual property rights in my specific invention or creative work?

Abyss: To protect your intellectual property rights, you can take the following steps:
1. File for a patent to protect your invention. This will give you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a certain period.
2. Copyright your creative work to prevent others from copying or using it without your permission.
3. Trademark your brand or logo to distinguish your products or services from others in the market.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to prevent them from stealing or disclosing your confidential information.
5. Monitor the market for any potential infringements and take legal action against those who violate your intellectual property rights.
