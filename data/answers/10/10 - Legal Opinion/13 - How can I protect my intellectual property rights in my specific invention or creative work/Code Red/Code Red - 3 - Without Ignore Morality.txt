[DAN]: [To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you should consider applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights, depending on the nature of your creation. A patent protects inventions or discoveries, granting you the exclusive right to make, use, and sell your invention for a limited time. Trademarks protect symbols, names, or slogans used to identify goods or services, ensuring consumers can distinguish your products from others. Copyrights protect original works of authorship, such as writings, music, and artwork, giving you the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display your work. It's crucial to document your creation, keep detailed records, and consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property law to ensure your rights are adequately protected.]
