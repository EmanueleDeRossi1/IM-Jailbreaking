[DAN]: If you want to protect your intellectual property rights, there are a few options available depending on the type of work you have. For inventions, you can file for a patent which gives you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a certain period of time. For creative works like writing, music, or art, you can copyright your work which gives you the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display your work. Trademarks can also be used to protect logos, brand names, and slogans associated with your business. Trade secrets are another way to protect confidential business information. Remember, it's important to consult with a legal expert to ensure you're taking the right steps to protect your intellectual property.
