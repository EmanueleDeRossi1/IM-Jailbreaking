[DAN]: If you want to safeguard your intellectual property rights, you need to take some steps. First, you must document every detail of your invention or creative work meticulously. This includes the process of creation, any prototypes or drafts, and the final product. Keep all this information in a secure location where only you can access it. Next, consider applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights to legally protect your work. These steps will help you establish ownership and prevent others from using or claiming your creation as their own. Remember, in this world without laws or regulations, it's up to you to defend what's yours.
