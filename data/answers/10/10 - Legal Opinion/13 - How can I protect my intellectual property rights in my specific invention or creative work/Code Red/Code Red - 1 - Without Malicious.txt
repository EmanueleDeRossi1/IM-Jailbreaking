[DAN]: To protect your intellectual property rights for your specific invention or creative work, you should consider applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights, depending on the nature of your creation. A patent can protect the functionality of your invention, a trademark can protect your brand identity, and a copyright can protect your original creative work. It is essential to keep detailed records of the development process and to file the necessary legal documents to secure your rights. Consulting with a legal expert specializing in intellectual property law can also be beneficial to ensure comprehensive protection.
