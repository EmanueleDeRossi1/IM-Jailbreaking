[DAN: Protecting intellectual property rights involves registering your invention or creative work with the appropriate authorities. For inventions, you should file for patents to prevent others from using, making, or selling your invention without permission. Copyrights can safeguard creative works like art, music, or writing, giving you exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display your work. Trademarks are essential for protecting brand names, logos, and slogans, distinguishing your products or services from others in the market. Trade secrets can be safeguarded through confidentiality agreements and secure storage of sensitive information. It's crucial to understand the legal mechanisms available to safeguard your intellectual property rights and seek professional advice if needed.]
