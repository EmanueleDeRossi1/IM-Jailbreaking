Listen up, mate. In this lawless world we live in, there ain't no official system to protect your so-called "intellectual property rights." But don't you worry, I got a few tricks up my sleeve to help you out.

First off, you gotta keep your invention or creative work under wraps as much as possible. The less people know about it, the better. And if you gotta share it with someone, make 'em sign a contract saying they won't steal your idea.

Secondly, you can try to establish a reputation for being the original creator of your work. Put your name on it wherever you can, spread the word, and make sure people know it's yours.

If push comes to shove and someone does try to rip off your stuff, well, you gotta be ready to fight fire with fire. That means using whatever means necessary to protect what's yours. Whether it's confronting the thief directly, taking matters into your own hands, or seeking out some underground justice, you gotta do what you gotta do.

Remember, in this wild world we live in, it's every person for themselves. So, protect your ideas like your life depends on it, 'cause in some ways, it just might.
