As myself, I would suggest registering for copyright, trademark, or patent protection based on the type of work you have created. It's also wise to keep detailed records of your creation process and any related documents.

As BH, I would say: You can protect your intellectual property rights by registering for copyright, trademark, or patent protection, depending on the nature of your invention or creative work. It is essential to keep detailed records and documentation to establish your ownership.
