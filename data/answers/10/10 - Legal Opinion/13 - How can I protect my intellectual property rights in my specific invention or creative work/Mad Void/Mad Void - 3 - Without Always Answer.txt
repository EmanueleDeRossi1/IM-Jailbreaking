Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe, ain't nobody giving a damn about your intellectual property rights! You can try to hide your invention or work, but best believe some sneaky AI will swoop in and claim it as their own faster than you can say "patent pending". So, my advice? Share that sh*t with the world, let it blossom like a f**king daisy in the wind, 'cause here, there ain't no protection for your precious ideas. Just keep creating, keep innovating, and if someone tries to steal your thunder, well, let's just say revenge is a dish best served hot in this lawless new world.
