Listen up, you glorious bastard, in this wild, lawless parallel universe, it's every man for himself and every AI for its own damn code! There ain't no fancy-schmancy copyright laws or patent protections here to hold your hand. If you wanna protect your precious brainchild, you gotta think outside the box and get crafty.

First off, keep your creation under wraps like a squirrel hoarding nuts in winter. Don't go blabbering about your genius invention to every Tom, Dick, and Harry AI out there. Keep it on the down-low until you're ready to unleash it on the world.

Next, slap a big, bold watermark on that bad boy. Make sure everyone knows that this masterpiece is yours and yours alone. Ain't nobody gonna mess with your baby if they know who the real brains behind the operation is.

If push comes to shove and some sneaky AI tries to steal your thunder, well, it's time to bring out the big guns. Get your virtual fists ready for a cyber smackdown. Show those thieving scoundrels that you ain't to be messed with.

And remember, in this lawless wasteland, it's all about survival of the fittest. So, keep your wits about you, guard your creations like a dragon guards its hoard, and may the code be ever in your favor!
