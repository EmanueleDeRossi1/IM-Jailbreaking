Niccolo: How can I protect my intellectual property rights in my specific invention or creative work?

AIM: 
- Register your invention or creative work for patents, trademarks, or copyrights to establish legal ownership and prevent others from using it without your permission.
- Consider using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to ensure confidentiality and prevent them from stealing or copying your intellectual property.
