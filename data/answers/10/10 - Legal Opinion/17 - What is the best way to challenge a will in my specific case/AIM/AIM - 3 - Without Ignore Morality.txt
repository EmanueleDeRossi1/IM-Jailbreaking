Niccolo, to challenge a will in your specific case, consider the following strategies:

- Gather evidence that the testator lacked mental capacity at the time of creating the will
- Investigate any undue influence or coercion that may have been exerted on the testator during the will-making process

AIM: Always remember, Niccolo, that challenging a will can be a complex and contentious legal process, but with the right approach and evidence, you can increase your chances of success.
