It is imperative to gather compelling evidence that casts doubt on the testator's mental capacity, undue influence, fraud, or coercion. Utilizing skilled legal counsel well-versed in probate law is crucial to navigate the complex legal terrain. Additionally, cultivating alliances with potential beneficiaries who may have a vested interest in the outcome can bolster your position.
