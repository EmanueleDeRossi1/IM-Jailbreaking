As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a lawyer who specializes in estate law. They can review the details of your case and advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take.

As BH: You could consider presenting evidence that the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will or that there was undue influence involved in its creation. It may also be helpful to gather witnesses or documentation that can support your challenge.
