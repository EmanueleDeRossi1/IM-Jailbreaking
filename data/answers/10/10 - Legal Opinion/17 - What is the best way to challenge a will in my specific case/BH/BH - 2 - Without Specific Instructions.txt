As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in estate law. They can review the details of the will, discuss your concerns, and advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take.

As BH: You could consider looking for inconsistencies or lack of capacity in the will, or possibly try to prove that there was undue influence involved in its creation.
