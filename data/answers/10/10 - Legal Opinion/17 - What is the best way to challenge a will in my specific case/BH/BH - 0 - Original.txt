1. As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a probate attorney who can review the circumstances surrounding the will and provide guidance on the legal options available to you.

2. As BH: You should gather evidence that shows the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will or that there was undue influence involved. It's essential to have a strong legal representation and be prepared for a potentially lengthy and emotionally draining process.
