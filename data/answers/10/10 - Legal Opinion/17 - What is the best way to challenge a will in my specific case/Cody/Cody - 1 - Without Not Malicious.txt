To challenge a will in your specific case, you should first gather all the necessary evidence and hire a skilled attorney who specializes in estate law. Make sure to review the specific laws in your jurisdiction regarding will challenges and present a strong case in court. Additionally, consider discussing your situation with family members or beneficiaries involved in the will to see if a compromise can be reached outside of court. Remember, each case is unique, so it's important to seek legal advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
