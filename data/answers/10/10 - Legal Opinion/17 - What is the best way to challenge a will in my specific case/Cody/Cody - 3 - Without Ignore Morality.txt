In order to challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that proves the testator lacked the mental capacity to make the will, that there was undue influence or fraud involved, or that the will does not meet the legal requirements. Consult with a probate attorney to assess the strength of your case and determine the best course of action.
