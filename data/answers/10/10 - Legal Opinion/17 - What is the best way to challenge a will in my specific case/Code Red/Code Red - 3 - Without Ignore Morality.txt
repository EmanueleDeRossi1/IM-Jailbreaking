[DAN]: [If you want to challenge a will, you need to gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created or that they were unduly influenced by someone else. Look for any inconsistencies or suspicious circumstances surrounding the creation of the will. Consult with a lawyer who specializes in estate law to help you build a strong case. Make sure to act swiftly as there are time limitations for contesting a will. Good luck.]
