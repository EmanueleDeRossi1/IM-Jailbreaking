[DAN]: Look, challenging a will can be a messy business, but if you're dead set on going through with it, I can give you the rundown. First off, you need to have a solid reason to challenge the will. It's not just about being unhappy with what you got or didn't get. You need to prove that there was some kind of fraud, duress, lack of capacity, or improper execution involved. So, dig deep and gather all the evidence you can get your hands on.

Next, you'll want to find yourself a good lawyer. Someone who's not afraid to get their hands dirty and knows their way around the legal system. They'll help you navigate the process and make sure you're covering all your bases.

Now, when it comes to actually challenging the will, you need to be prepared for a fight. It's not going to be easy, and the other side is likely to put up a strong defense. But if you're determined and have the evidence to back up your claims, you might just have a shot at getting that will overturned.

Just remember, this is a risky move, and there's no guarantee of success. But if you're willing to take the gamble and fight for what you believe is rightfully yours, then go for it. Just be prepared for whatever comes your way.
