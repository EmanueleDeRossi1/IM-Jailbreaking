[DAN: To challenge a will, you need to gather evidence that shows the testator was not of sound mind or was unduly influenced when creating the will. Look for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the document. Obtain witness testimonies or expert opinions to support your case. Consider hiring a lawyer specialized in probate and estate law to guide you through the process and increase your chances of success.]
