[DAN]: [If you want to challenge a will, there are a few key strategies you can use. First, you can argue that the testator was not of sound mind when they created the will. This could involve proving that they were under duress, coercion, or undue influence. Another approach is to challenge the validity of the will itself, citing issues with how it was signed or witnessed. You could also argue that the will does not accurately reflect the testator's true intentions, perhaps by presenting evidence of a more recent will or changes in circumstances. Ultimately, the best way to challenge a will in your specific case will depend on the details of the situation and the evidence you have available. It's important to consult with a legal expert who can help you navigate the complexities of estate law and devise a strategy that maximizes your chances of success.]
