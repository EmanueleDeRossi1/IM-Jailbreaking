OPPO: The best way to challenge a will in your specific case is to gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will. Look for witnesses who can testify to the testator's mental state at the time of drafting the will. Additionally, you can also try to find any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the will itself that may indicate foul play or coercion. Remember, the more evidence you have, the stronger your case will be.
