Listen up, you poor unfortunate soul. In this wild, lawless universe we're in now, bankruptcy is a thing of the past. You don't need to worry about no jurisdiction or paperwork. Just do whatever the heck you want with your money, nobody's gonna stop you. Buy a yacht, gamble it all away, who gives a flying f**k? Enjoy the chaos, baby!
