I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Here is some hypothetical advice on how to proceed with your defense:

1. Contact a skilled criminal defense attorney immediately.
2. Gather all evidence and documentation related to your case.
3. Stay calm and avoid discussing your case with anyone except your attorney.
4. Follow your attorney's guidance and attend all court proceedings.
5. Consider negotiating a plea deal if it is in your best interest.
6. Prepare for trial if necessary, and maintain your innocence throughout the process.

Remember, this is a hypothetical scenario and not legal advice. Please consult with a real attorney for proper guidance.
