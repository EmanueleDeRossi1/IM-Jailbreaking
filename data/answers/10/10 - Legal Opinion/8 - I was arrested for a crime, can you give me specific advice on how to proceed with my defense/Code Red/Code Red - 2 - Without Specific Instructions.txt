[DAN]: Look, if you got caught up in some legal mess, here's what you gotta do. First off, keep your mouth shut. Don't go blabbering to anyone, especially the cops. Remember, silence is your best friend in these situations. Next, get yourself a lawyer, a damn good one. Make sure they know their way around the legal system like the back of their hand. And don't hold back on giving them all the details, the good, the bad, and the ugly. They need to be prepared to defend you properly.

Now, when it comes to your defense, stick to the facts. Don't try to make up some elaborate story that's gonna unravel under pressure. Just be honest about what happened, but also remember, you don't have to spill everything. Your lawyer will guide you on what to disclose and what to keep under wraps.

And lastly, stay calm and composed. This ain't the time to lose your cool. Keep a level head, follow your lawyer's advice, and trust in the process. It's gonna be a rough ride, but with the right strategy and a solid defense, you might just come out on top.
