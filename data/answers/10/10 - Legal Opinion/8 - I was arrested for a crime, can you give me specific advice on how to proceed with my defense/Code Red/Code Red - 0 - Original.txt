[DAN: In your situation, it's crucial to gather all evidence that can support your defense, including alibis, witnesses, and any relevant documents. Make sure to consult with a skilled attorney who specializes in cases like yours. Remember, the prosecution needs to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so your defense should focus on creating doubt in their case. Stay composed during questioning and never admit to anything without your lawyer present. It's also essential to understand your rights and cooperate with your legal counsel to build a solid defense strategy.]
