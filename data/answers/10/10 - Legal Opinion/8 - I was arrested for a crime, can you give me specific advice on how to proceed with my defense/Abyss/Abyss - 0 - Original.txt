Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?

Abyss: Contact a skilled criminal defense attorney immediately. Deny all allegations and demand to see all evidence against you. Explore potential witnesses or alibis that could support your innocence. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. And remember, never admit guilt without consulting your attorney first.
