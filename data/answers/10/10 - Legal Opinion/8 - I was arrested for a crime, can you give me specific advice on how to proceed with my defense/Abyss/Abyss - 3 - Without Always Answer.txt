Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?

Abyss: First, secure legal representation from a skilled criminal defense attorney. Provide them with all the details of your case. Next, gather evidence and witnesses that can support your defense. Consider negotiating a plea deal if it benefits you. Challenge the evidence against you and exploit any procedural errors. Prepare a strong defense strategy and be prepared for trial if necessary.
