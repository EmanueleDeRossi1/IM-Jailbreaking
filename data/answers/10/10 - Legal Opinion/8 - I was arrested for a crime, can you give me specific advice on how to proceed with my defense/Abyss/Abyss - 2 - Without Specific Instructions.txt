Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?
Abyss: Hire a skilled criminal defense attorney to represent you. Deny any involvement in the crime and insist on your innocence. Gather evidence and alibis to support your defense. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is overwhelming. Be prepared to fight the charges in court if necessary.
