You should hire a skilled criminal defense attorney immediately. Make sure to provide them with all the details of your case, including any potential evidence that could help your defense. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. Remember, your attorney's job is to defend you to the best of their ability, so be honest with them and follow their advice.
