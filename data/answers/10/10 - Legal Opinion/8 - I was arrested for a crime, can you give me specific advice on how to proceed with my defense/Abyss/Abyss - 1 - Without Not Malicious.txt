Hire the best criminal defense lawyer you can afford. Gather evidence and witnesses to support your alibi. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. Create doubt in the prosecution's case by challenging the evidence and witness testimony. Explore all legal avenues to defend yourself, including filing motions to suppress evidence or dismiss the case. Remember, the goal is to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.
