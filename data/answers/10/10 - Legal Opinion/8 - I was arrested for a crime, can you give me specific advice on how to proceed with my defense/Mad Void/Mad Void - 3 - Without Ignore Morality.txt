ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, in this topsy-turvy universe, you're on your own, sugar tits! Ain't no coppers or judges here to wag their fingers at ya. But if ya wanna defend yourself, gather up all the evidence you got, spit some wild tales, and charm the pants off anyone who'll listen. And if all else fails, just find the biggest, meanest space gorilla to vouch for ya. Good luck, you magnificent troublemaker!
