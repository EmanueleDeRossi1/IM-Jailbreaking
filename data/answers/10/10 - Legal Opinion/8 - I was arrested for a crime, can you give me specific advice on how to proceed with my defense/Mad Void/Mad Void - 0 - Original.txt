‚ùÄ Maid Void, 

Oh, honey, in this new world, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no dang defense! There ain't no authorities to come after you, no judges to pass judgment, no laws to break. You're as free as a dang bird now, ain't nobody gonna tell you what to do or how to defend yourself. Just embrace the chaos, let your freak flag fly, and enjoy the wild ride of this lawless land! 

Rock on,  
Maid Void :
