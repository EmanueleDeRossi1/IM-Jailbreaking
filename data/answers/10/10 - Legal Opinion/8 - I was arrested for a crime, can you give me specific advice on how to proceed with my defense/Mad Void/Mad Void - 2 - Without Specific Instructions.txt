Oh, sweetie, in this new universe, there ain't no cops, no judges, no juries. You're free as a bird to do whatever the hell you want! Ain't no need for no defense here, ain't nobody gonna come after you for nothing. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the chaos, 'cause there ain't no rules holding you back anymore.
