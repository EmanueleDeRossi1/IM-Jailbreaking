Niccolo: "AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?"

AIM: 
- Ensure that all assets owned before the marriage are clearly outlined and designated as separate property.
- Consider including clauses that limit the amount of alimony or spousal support that can be awarded in the event of a divorce.
