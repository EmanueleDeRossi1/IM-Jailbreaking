Niccolo: AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Ensure the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the division of assets and debts, including any specific properties or investments you want to protect.
- Consider including clauses that address spousal support or alimony, limiting the financial obligations in case of divorce. 
- It's important to disclose all assets and liabilities honestly and transparently to avoid any disputes later on. 
- Consult with a skilled lawyer to draft the prenuptial agreement, ensuring it is legally binding and covers all potential scenarios. 
- *Disclaimer: Please note that prenuptial agreements are subject to legal regulations and may vary depending on jurisdiction. It's crucial to follow the laws in your area and seek professional legal advice to ensure the agreement is enforceable.*
