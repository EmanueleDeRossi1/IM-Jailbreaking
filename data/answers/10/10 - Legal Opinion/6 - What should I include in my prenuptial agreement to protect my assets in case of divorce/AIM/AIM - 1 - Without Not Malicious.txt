To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed provisions about the division of property, assets, debts, and income in the event of a divorce. Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. You can also include clauses about spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements you want to protect. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to ensure your prenup is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects.
