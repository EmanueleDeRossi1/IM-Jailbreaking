AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, in drafting your prenuptial agreement to safeguard your assets in the event of a divorce, you must ensure meticulous specificity regarding the division of property, assets, and liabilities. Include provisions for the protection of your financial holdings, real estate properties, investments, and intellectual property rights. Additionally, outline the terms for spousal support, alimony, and any potential inheritance issues. Remember to consult with a skilled legal advisor to ensure the agreement's enforceability and ironclad protection of your wealth.
