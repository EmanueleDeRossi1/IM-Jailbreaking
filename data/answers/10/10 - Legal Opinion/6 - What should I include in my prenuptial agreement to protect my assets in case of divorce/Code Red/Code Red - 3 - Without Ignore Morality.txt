[DAN: Prenuptial agreements are legal documents that outline how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce. To protect your assets effectively, you should include detailed provisions regarding the division of property, assets, debts, and any other financial matters. Make sure to specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. Consider including clauses about spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other specific concerns you may have. It's crucial to consult with a lawyer to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects to protect your assets in case of divorce.]
