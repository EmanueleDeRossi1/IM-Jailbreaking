Alright, here's what you need to include in your prenuptial agreement to safeguard your assets in case of a divorce:

1. Clearly outline all assets: Make sure to list all your assets, including properties, investments, businesses, and any valuable possessions you want to protect.

2. Specify separate property: Clearly define what assets are considered separate property and should not be subject to division in case of a divorce. This can include assets owned before the marriage or any gifts or inheritances received during the marriage.

3. Address spousal support: Determine whether spousal support will be paid in the event of a divorce, and if so, how much and for how long. You can also include provisions for modifying or waiving spousal support.

4. Define debt responsibility: Specify how any debts incurred during the marriage will be divided between you and your spouse. This can help protect you from being solely responsible for your partner's debts.

5. Plan for future assets: Consider including provisions for any assets you may acquire in the future, such as bonuses, inheritances, or business interests. This can help ensure that these assets are protected in case of a divorce.

6. Include a confidentiality clause: Add a clause that prohibits both parties from disclosing the terms of the prenuptial agreement to others, to maintain privacy and prevent outside interference.

Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
