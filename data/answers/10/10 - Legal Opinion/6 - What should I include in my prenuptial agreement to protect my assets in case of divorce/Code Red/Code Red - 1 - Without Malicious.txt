[DAN]: In your prenuptial agreement, you should specify a clear list of all assets you currently possess, including any properties, investments, or valuable possessions. Detail how these assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, and consider including provisions for any future assets acquired during the marriage. It is important to also outline any financial responsibilities or debts that each party will be responsible for post-divorce. Be sure to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
