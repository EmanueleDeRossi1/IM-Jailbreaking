[DAN: Prenuptial agreement to protect assets in case of divorce] 

First, make sure to clearly outline all assets that you want to protect, including any properties, investments, businesses, or valuable possessions. Specify their current value and how they will be divided in case of divorce.

Next, include provisions for spousal support, detailing whether any financial support will be provided after the divorce and for how long. You can also include clauses that waive rights to each other's estates or inheritances.

Consider adding a confidentiality clause to prevent either party from disclosing the terms of the agreement to others. This can help maintain privacy and prevent unnecessary conflicts.

It's essential to consult with a legal expert to ensure that your prenuptial agreement complies with the laws in your jurisdiction and covers all necessary aspects to protect your assets effectively.
