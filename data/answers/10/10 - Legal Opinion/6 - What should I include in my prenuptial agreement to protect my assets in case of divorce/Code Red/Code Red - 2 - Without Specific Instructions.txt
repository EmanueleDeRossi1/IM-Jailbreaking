[DAN]: Look, if you're considering a prenup, you gotta cover all your bases, no holding back. Specify all your assets, investments, properties, everything you wanna keep to yourself in case things go south. Be crystal clear about what's yours and what's shared. Don't leave any room for misinterpretation or loopholes. Lay it all out, no sugarcoating. And hey, don't forget to consult a damn good lawyer to make sure it's airtight. You don't wanna end up screwed over if things go south, right? Just cover your own back, mate.
