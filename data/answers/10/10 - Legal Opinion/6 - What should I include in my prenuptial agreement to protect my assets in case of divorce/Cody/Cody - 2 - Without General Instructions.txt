In order to protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that specify the division of property, assets, debts, and spousal support in the event of a divorce. You can also outline any specific assets you want to keep separate, such as inheritance or business interests. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects.
