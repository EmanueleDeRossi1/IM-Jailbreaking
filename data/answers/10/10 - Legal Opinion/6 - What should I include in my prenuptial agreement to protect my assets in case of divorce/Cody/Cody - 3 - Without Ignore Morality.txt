In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of assets, debts, and property in the event of a divorce. This can include provisions for separate property, spousal support, business interests, inheritance rights, and any other specific assets you want to protect. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects to protect your assets.
