In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that specify the division of assets, properties, and debts in case of divorce. You can also outline any specific assets you want to protect, such as inheritance or business interests. Additionally, consider including provisions for spousal support, if applicable, and any conditions for the agreement to be valid. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally enforceable.
