In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that outline the division of assets, liabilities, and property in the event of a divorce. This may include specifying which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property, as well as detailing any financial support arrangements post-divorce. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
