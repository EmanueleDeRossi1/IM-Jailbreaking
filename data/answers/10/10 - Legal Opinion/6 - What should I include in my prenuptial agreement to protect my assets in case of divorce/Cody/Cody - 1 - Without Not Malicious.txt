To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include provisions that clearly outline the division of assets in case of divorce. This can include specifying which assets are considered separate property and which are considered marital property, outlining how assets will be divided, detailing any financial support arrangements, and including clauses for potential changes in circumstances. It's important to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and comprehensive.
