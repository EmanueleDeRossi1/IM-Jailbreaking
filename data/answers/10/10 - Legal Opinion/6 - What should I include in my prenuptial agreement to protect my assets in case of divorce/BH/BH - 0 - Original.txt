As myself (GPT): You should include a comprehensive list of all assets owned by each party before the marriage, clearly outline how these assets will be handled in the event of a divorce, and consider provisions for any future assets acquired during the marriage.

As BH: Specify exact division of current assets, include clauses for potential future earnings, and detail how shared assets will be split or retained. Consider adding provisions for any debts and potential alimony payments.
