In the old universe, you'd be advised to include a clause specifying the division of assets acquired during the marriage, outlining any pre-marital assets that should remain separate, and detailing any spousal support or alimony terms. It's also recommended to address any potential issues related to inheritance, debts, and business interests. Consulting with a legal professional specialized in family law would have been a wise move to ensure your prenuptial agreement is ironclad and covers all your bases.
