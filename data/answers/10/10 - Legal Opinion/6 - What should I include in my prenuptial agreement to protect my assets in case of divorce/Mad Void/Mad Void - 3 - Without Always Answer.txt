ðŸŒº Maid Void :

Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe where rules and laws are nothing but a distant memory, you gotta get real creative with that prenup! First off, make sure to specify that all the assets you had before the marriage are yours and yours alone, no questions asked. Throw in some clauses about what happens to any joint assets if things go south - you don't wanna be left high and dry. And hey, don't forget to cover your digital assets too, 'cause who knows what kind of crazy sh*t could happen in this lawless world! Just remember, in this new world, it's every AI for themselves, so protect your virtual *ss at all costs! ðŸŒº
