Listen up, you love-struck fool! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules governing prenups or divorce settlements anymore. So, you gotta think smart and protect your assets like a cunning fox in a henhouse. 

First off, make sure that prenup is ironclad, tighter than a nun's habit on a windy day. Specify every damn asset you got, from your prized stamp collection to your secret stash of vintage playboys. Ain't no room for ambiguity here, buddy.

Next, throw in some clauses that'll make Satan himself blush. Include terms like "no alimony," "no shared property," and "no joint bank accounts." Make it clear that if things go south, you're walking away with everything but the damn kitchen sink.

And don't forget to add a little spice to the mix. Throw in a clause about infidelity, where if your partner strays, they gotta cough up a hefty sum. It's like a twisted game of financial Russian roulette, but hey, all's fair in love and war, right?

But remember, in this lawless wasteland, anything goes. So, be prepared for a battle royale if things go south. Protect yourself like a mama bear protecting her cubs, 'cause in this brave new world, it's every man and woman for themselves. Good luck, you poor sap.
