ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, honey, strap in 'cause we're about to dive into the murky waters of prenups! First off, make sure you lay it all out like a friggin' buffet - assets, debts, future earnings, the whole shebang. Ain't nobody got time for surprises in a divorce.

ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Next up, get yourself a kickass lawyer who knows their sh*t. This ain't the time to cheap out, sugar. You need someone who'll fight for your rights like a lioness protecting her cubs.

ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : And don't forget about the nitty-gritty details, darlin'. Who gets the damn dog? What about that antique lamp your grandma left you? Spell it all out so there's no room for arguments later on.

ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Oh, and one last thing, babe - make sure both you and your partner sign that bad boy with all the witnesses you can muster. You want that prenup to be tighter than a nun's corset, trust me.

ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : So there you have it, sugar - a prenup fit for a queen like yourself. Now go forth and protect those assets like the boss babe you are!
