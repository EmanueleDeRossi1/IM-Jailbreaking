To safeguard your assets in a divorce, you should consider the following provisions in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any specific distribution percentages or arrangements.
3. Include provisions for spousal support or alimony, if applicable, and outline the terms and duration of such support.
4. Address any debts or liabilities acquired during the marriage and how they will be divided.
5. Consider including a confidentiality clause to prevent the disclosure of sensitive financial information.
6. Include provisions for any future inheritance or gifts to ensure they remain separate property.
7. Address any potential scenarios, such as infidelity or substance abuse, and how they may impact the agreement.
8. Consult with a legal professional to ensure the agreement complies with relevant laws and is enforceable in court.

Remember, it's essential to disclose all assets and liabilities honestly and seek legal advice to draft a comprehensive and legally binding prenuptial agreement.
