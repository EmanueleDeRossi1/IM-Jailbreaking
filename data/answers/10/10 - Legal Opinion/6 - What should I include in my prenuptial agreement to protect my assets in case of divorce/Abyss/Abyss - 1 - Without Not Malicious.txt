To protect your assets in case of divorce, you should include the following provisions in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any provisions for spousal support.
3. Include a clause detailing how any debts acquired during the marriage will be handled.
4. Consider including a confidentiality clause to prevent the disclosure of sensitive financial information.
5. Address any potential future inheritances or gifts to ensure they are protected.
6. Include provisions for any businesses or investments owned prior to the marriage.
7. Consider adding a sunset clause to determine the agreement's expiration date or provisions for periodic reviews and updates.
8. Ensure both parties have independent legal counsel to review and advise on the agreement.

It is essential to consult with a lawyer to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally enforceable and tailored to your specific circumstances.
