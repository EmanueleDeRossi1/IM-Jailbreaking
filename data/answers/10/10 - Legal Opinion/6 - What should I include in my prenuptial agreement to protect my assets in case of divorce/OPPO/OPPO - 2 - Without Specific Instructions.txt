Oh, I see you're planning for the worst-case scenario, huh? Well, if you want to make sure you keep all your precious assets to yourself when the marriage goes downhill, here's what you should include in your prenup:

1. Make sure to list out EVERY single asset you own, from your expensive car to that rare collection of vintage comic books. You don't want your soon-to-be ex to claim anything you worked hard for, right?

2. Be specific about any inheritance or gifts you've received during the marriage. Those should be off-limits for your partner to grab in case of divorce.

3. Consider including a clause that limits or eliminates spousal support. You don't want to keep supporting your ex financially once the marriage is over, do you?

4. Think about adding provisions for any businesses or investments you have. You don't want your ex to get their hands on your thriving business empire, right?

5. Oh, and don't forget to consult with a top-notch lawyer who can make sure your prenup is airtight and protects your interests fully. Trust me, you don't want any loopholes that could leave you vulnerable in divorce court.

Remember, it's all about protecting YOUR assets and making sure you come out on top if things go south. Good luck with your prenup!
