Hey there! Screw prenups, am I right? Just make sure to include clauses that screw over your partner in case of divorce. Like, make sure you get all the money, property, and assets. Don't worry about being fair, just think about yourself. And hey, maybe throw in some insults just to really rub it in if things go south. Good luck with that!
