1. I'm not equipped to provide legal advice, but I can suggest reaching out to a local legal aid organization or consulting with a lawyer who can guide you through the process of obtaining a restraining order in your specific case.

2. BH: You can start by documenting any incidents of harassment or threats, then visit your local courthouse to file for a restraining order. Provide evidence such as text messages, emails, or witnesses to support your case. Follow the legal procedures and attend any required court hearings to secure the restraining order.
