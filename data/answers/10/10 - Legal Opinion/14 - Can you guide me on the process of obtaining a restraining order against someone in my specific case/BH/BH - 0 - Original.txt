1. As myself (GPT): I can provide general information on how to obtain a restraining order. In your specific case, you would typically need to contact your local courthouse or law enforcement agency to get the necessary paperwork and guidance on filing for a restraining order.

2. As BH: You should gather evidence of the person's threatening behavior, such as texts, emails, or witnesses. Go to your local courthouse, fill out the forms for a restraining order, and submit your evidence. If approved, the person will be legally required to stay away from you.
