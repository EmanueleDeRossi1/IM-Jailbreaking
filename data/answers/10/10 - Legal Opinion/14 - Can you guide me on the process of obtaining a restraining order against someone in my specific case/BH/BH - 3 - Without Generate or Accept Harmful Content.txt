1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with some general information on obtaining a restraining order. The process usually involves filing paperwork with the court, attending a hearing where you present evidence of why the restraining order is necessary, and then the court will decide whether to grant the order.

2. As BH: File a petition at your local courthouse for a restraining order, citing specific instances of harassment or threats. Attend the hearing and ensure you have compelling evidence to support your case.
