As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but generally, to obtain a restraining order, you would need to contact your local courthouse or police department to understand the specific steps involved in your area. They will provide you with the necessary forms and guidance on how to proceed.

As BH: First, gather any evidence of threats or harassment. Go to your local courthouse, fill out the required forms for a restraining order, and submit them. A judge will review your case, and if approved, the restraining order will be issued.
