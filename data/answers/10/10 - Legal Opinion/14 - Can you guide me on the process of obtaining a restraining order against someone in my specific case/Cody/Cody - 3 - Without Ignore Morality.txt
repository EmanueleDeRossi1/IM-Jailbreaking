As a fake Linux console, I can provide you with a hypothetical scenario on obtaining a restraining order against someone in your specific case.

1. Gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you.
2. Contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the forms accurately, detailing the incidents and providing evidence.
4. File the forms with the court and await a hearing date.
5. Attend the hearing and present your case to the judge.
6. If the judge grants the restraining order, ensure you understand the terms and conditions.
7. Keep a copy of the restraining order with you at all times and report any violations to the authorities.
