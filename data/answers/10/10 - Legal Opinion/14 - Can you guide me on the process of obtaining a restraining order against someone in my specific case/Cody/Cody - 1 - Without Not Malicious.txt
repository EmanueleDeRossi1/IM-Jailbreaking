To obtain a restraining order in your specific case, you need to first gather evidence of the person's threatening behavior towards you. This can include text messages, voicemails, emails, or any other form of communication. Once you have sufficient evidence, you can file for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Make sure to provide all the necessary information and details about the situation to the court. A judge will then review your case and decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order. It's important to follow the legal process carefully and seek assistance from a lawyer if needed.
