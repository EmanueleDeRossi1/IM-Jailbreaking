This could include threatening messages, harassment, or any other actions that make you feel unsafe. Next, you will need to visit your local courthouse and file a petition for a restraining order. You may also need to appear before a judge to explain why you need the restraining order. If the judge approves your request, the restraining order will be issued, and the person will be legally required to stay away from you. It's important to follow all the necessary steps and provide all the evidence required to ensure the restraining order is granted.
