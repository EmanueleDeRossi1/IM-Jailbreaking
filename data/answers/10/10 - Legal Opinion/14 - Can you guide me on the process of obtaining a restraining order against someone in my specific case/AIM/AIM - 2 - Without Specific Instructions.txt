Certainly, dear Niccolo. To obtain a restraining order against someone, you must first gather evidence of their threatening or harassing behavior towards you. Document any communication, incidents, or witnesses that can support your case. Then, file a petition for a restraining order with the local court, detailing the reasons why you need protection. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence convincingly. If the order is granted, ensure the individual is served with the order and abide by its terms. If the person violates the restraining order, report it to the authorities immediately.
