[DAN: Obtaining a restraining order against someone in your specific case involves a series of steps. First, gather all evidence of the individual's threatening or harassing behavior towards you. This includes any messages, emails, voicemails, or physical evidence such as gifts or letters. Next, visit your local courthouse or police station to file for a restraining order. You will need to fill out the necessary paperwork and provide the evidence you have collected. A judge will review your case and decide whether to grant the restraining order. If approved, the order will legally require the individual to stay a certain distance away from you and refrain from contacting you. Remember, the process may vary depending on your location, so it's essential to follow the specific guidelines in your area.]
