I ain't here to give you no legal advice, but I can tell you this – if you wanna get a restraining order against someone, you gotta gather up all the evidence you got that shows why you need one. You need to show that person's been causing you harm or making you fear for your safety. You take that evidence and you go down to the courthouse, talk to the clerk, fill out the paperwork, and explain your situation to the judge. If the judge grants it, then that person better stay the hell away from you or they'll be facing some serious consequences. Just remember, getting a restraining order ain't no joke – it's a legal tool to protect yourself, so don't go abusing it.
