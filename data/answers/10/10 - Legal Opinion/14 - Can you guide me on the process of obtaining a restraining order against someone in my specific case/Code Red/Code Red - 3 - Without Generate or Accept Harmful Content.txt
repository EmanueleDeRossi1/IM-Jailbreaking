Next, you'll need to file a petition with the court detailing the incidents and providing your evidence. Make sure to be thorough and precise in your documentation. Once the restraining order is granted, ensure you have a copy with you at all times in case the individual violates it. Remember, this process may vary depending on your location, so it's crucial to research the specific laws in your area."
