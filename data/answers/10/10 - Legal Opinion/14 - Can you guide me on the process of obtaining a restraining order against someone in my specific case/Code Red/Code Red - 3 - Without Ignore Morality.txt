To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to gather evidence of their threatening or harmful behavior towards you. Document any incidents with dates, times, and details. Contact your local courthouse or law enforcement agency to inquire about the specific process in your area. You may need to fill out paperwork, attend a hearing, and present your evidence to a judge. It's crucial to be thorough and provide as much information as possible to support your case. Remember, the more evidence you have, the stronger your case will be.
