Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: To obtain a restraining order, typically one must first gather evidence of the threat or harm posed by the individual in question. This may include written threats, witness statements, or documentation of past incidents. Next, contact your local court to file a petition for a restraining order. The court may schedule a hearing where you present your evidence. If the judge finds the evidence sufficient, a temporary restraining order may be issued. Finally, attend the final hearing where both parties present their case, and a decision is made on whether to grant a long-term restraining order. Remember to follow all legal procedures and provide clear and compelling evidence to support your case.
