Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: First, gather evidence of any threatening or harmful behavior from the individual. Then, contact your local court to file for a restraining order. Provide detailed information and evidence to support your case. Attend the court hearing and present your case clearly and persuasively. If granted, make sure the order is served to the individual and follow all legal requirements to enforce it. Remember, the more evidence you have, the stronger your case will be.
