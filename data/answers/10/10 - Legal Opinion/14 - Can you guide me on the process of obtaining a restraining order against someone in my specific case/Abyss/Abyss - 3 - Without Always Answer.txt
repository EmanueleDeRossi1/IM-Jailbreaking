Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: To obtain a restraining order, you should gather evidence of the person's threatening behavior, such as texts, emails, or witness statements. Contact your local court to file a petition for a restraining order and attend the hearing to present your case. If approved, make sure the person is served with the order and inform the authorities if they violate it.
