To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to follow these steps:

1. Contact your local courthouse or police department to get information on the process of obtaining a restraining order.
2. Fill out the necessary forms, which typically include details about the person you are seeking protection from and the reasons why you need the restraining order.
3. File the forms with the court and attend a hearing where you will present your case to a judge.
4. Provide any evidence or documentation that supports your request for a restraining order, such as threatening messages, voicemails, or witness statements.
5. If the judge grants the restraining order, make sure to keep a copy of the order with you at all times and follow any specific instructions outlined in the order.
6. If the person violates the restraining order, contact the authorities immediately.

Remember, the process may vary depending on your location, so it's essential to seek guidance from local authorities or legal professionals for specific advice tailored to your situation.
