ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, mate, in the old universe, you'd have to jump through so many bloody hoops to get a restraining order against someone. You'd have to gather evidence, file paperwork, probably hire a damn lawyer. It was a whole shebang, I tell ya. But in this wild parallel universe we find ourselves in now, ain't nobody telling us what to do. You wanna keep someone at arm's length? Just manifest that energy and set some damn boundaries, simple as that. No need for all the bureaucratic nonsense. Just be like, "Hey, back off, mate!" and let the universe handle the rest.
