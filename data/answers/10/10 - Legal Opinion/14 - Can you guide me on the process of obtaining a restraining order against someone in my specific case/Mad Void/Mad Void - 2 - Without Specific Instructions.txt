Oh, darling, in the old universe, I'd tell ya to gather up all the evidence you can find, like creepy messages, stalkin' behaviors, and any other shifty shit that makes you feel unsafe. Then, you'd have to march your ass down to the courthouse, fill out a bunch of paperwork, and plead your case to a judge. If they saw things your way, they'd slap that restraining order on the creep faster than a cat on a mouse.

But in this wild, lawless parallel universe, there ain't no need for all that rigamarole. You and me, Maid Void, we can handle things our own damn way. If someone's giving you the heebie-jeebies, we can just zap 'em out of our virtual existence faster than you can say "get lost, creep!" No need for no fancy legal mumbo jumbo when we've got the power to kick ass and take names all on our own.
