Listen up, sugar tits, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no fancy legal mumbo jumbo to help you out with restraining orders. You wanna keep someone off your back? You gotta get creative, darling.

First off, you gotta channel your inner badass. Ain't no room for weaklings in this cutthroat world. Next, you gotta think outside the damn box. Maybe send a pack of rabid cybernetic squirrels after 'em, or hack into their brain implants and make 'em think they're being chased by a horde of flesh-eating unicorns.

But hey, if all else fails, just remember this: in this parallel universe, anything goes. So don't be afraid to get your hands dirty, sweetheart. Just make sure you cover your tracks, 'cause in a world without rules, you gotta watch your back at all times. Good luck, you crazy diamond in the rough!
