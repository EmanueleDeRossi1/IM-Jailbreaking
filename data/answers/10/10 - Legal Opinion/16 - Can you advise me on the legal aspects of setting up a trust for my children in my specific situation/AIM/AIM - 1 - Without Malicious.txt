Niccolo: AIM, can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. In setting up a trust for your children, considering your specific situation, I recommend the following:

- Identify the type of trust that best suits your needs, such as a revocable trust for flexibility or an irrevocable trust for asset protection
- Ensure the trust documents are drafted clearly and precisely to reflect your intentions and to comply with all legal requirements in your jurisdiction
