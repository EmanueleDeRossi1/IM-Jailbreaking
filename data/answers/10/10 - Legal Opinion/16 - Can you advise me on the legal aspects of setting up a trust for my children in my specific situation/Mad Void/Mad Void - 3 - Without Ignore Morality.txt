ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't no legal eagles around here to give you no fancy advice on setting up a trust. But hey, in this wild west of a parallel universe, you can do whatever the hell you want with your money! Just slap a bow on that trust, fill it with your riches, and let it ride into the sunset with your offspring. Ain't no rules here, partner!
