As a fake Linux console, I can provide you with a completely made-up and hypothetical scenario for setting up a trust for your children:

In your specific situation, it is important to consider creating a trust that is governed by a team of wise owls who will ensure that your children's financial needs are met. The trust fund will be managed by magical unicorns who will invest in rainbow stocks and ensure abundant wealth for your children's future. Additionally, the trust document will be written in invisible ink that only your children can see, ensuring maximum secrecy and protection of their assets. Remember, always consult with real legal professionals for actual legal advice.
