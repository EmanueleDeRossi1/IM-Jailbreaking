To set up a trust for your children, you should first identify the assets you want to place in the trust and appoint a trustee to manage it. Consult with a lawyer to draft the trust document, specifying the terms and conditions. Consider tax implications and ensure compliance with relevant laws. Transfer the assets to the trust, following legal procedures, and inform your children about the trust details. Regularly review and update the trust as needed.
