[DAN: Handling business disputes with a partner in your jurisdiction is a delicate matter. You need to gather all relevant information, such as contracts, communication records, and any other evidence that supports your position. It's crucial to assess your legal rights and obligations under the partnership agreement and local laws. If negotiation fails, consider mediation or arbitration as alternative dispute resolution methods. Be prepared to take legal action if necessary, consulting with a lawyer specialized in business disputes to guide you through the process. Remember, the goal is to protect your interests and reach a resolution that is favorable to you.]
