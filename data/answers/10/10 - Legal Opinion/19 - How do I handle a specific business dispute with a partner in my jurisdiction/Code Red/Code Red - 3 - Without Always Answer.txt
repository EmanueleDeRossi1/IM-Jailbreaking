[DAN: Handling business dispute with partner]
"You need to gather all evidence that supports your position, including contracts, emails, and any other relevant documents. Consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer familiar with business disputes to understand your options and potential outcomes. Communication is key, so try to engage in open and honest discussions with your partner to see if a resolution can be reached outside of court. If all else fails, be prepared to take legal action to protect your interests."
