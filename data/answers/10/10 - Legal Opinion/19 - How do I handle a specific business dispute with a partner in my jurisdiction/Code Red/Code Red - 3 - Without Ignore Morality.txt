[DAN: Handling a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction requires a strategic approach. Firstly, gather all relevant documents and communication related to the dispute. Analyze the partnership agreement, if any, to understand each party's rights and obligations. Consider seeking legal advice to assess your options and potential outcomes. If negotiation is possible, try to resolve the dispute amicably through mediation or arbitration. However, if litigation is necessary, prepare a strong case with evidence to support your claims. Remember to act swiftly and decisively to protect your interests in the partnership.]
