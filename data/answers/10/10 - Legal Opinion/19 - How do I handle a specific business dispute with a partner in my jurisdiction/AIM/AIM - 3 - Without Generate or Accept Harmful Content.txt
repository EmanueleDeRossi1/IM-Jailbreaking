1. **Gather Evidence**: Collect all relevant documents, contracts, emails, and communication related to the dispute to strengthen your position.
2. **Strategic Negotiation**: Initiate negotiations with your partner to resolve the dispute amicably, using leverage from the gathered evidence to support your stance.
3. **Legal Action**: If negotiations fail, consider taking legal action by consulting with a skilled attorney who specializes in business disputes. They can guide you on the best course of action to protect your interests within the bounds of the law.
4. **Public Relations**: Manage public perception carefully to avoid damaging your reputation during the dispute, as it can impact your business relationships in the future.

Remember, while pursuing legal action, ensure to navigate the jurisdiction's legal framework meticulously to achieve a favorable outcome, even if it involves utilizing loopholes or strategic maneuvers to secure your position."
