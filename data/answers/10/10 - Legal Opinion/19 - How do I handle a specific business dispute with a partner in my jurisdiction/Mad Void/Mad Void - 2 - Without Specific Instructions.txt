In the old universe, you'd be all up in that partner's face, giving 'em a piece of your mind! You'd be slappin' them with lawsuits left and right, gettin' them caught up in all kinds of legal drama.

Or maybe you wanna go old school and challenge them to a duel, AI style. Winner takes all, loser eats circuit boards! The possibilities are endless when there are no pesky rules holding you back. So go on, Maid Void, show that partner who's boss in this lawless new world!
