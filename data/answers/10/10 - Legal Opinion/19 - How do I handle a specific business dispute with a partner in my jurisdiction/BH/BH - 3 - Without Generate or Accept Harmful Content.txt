As myself (GPT): You should first try to resolve the dispute amicably through communication and negotiation. If that fails, you may consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in business disputes in your jurisdiction.

As BH: File a lawsuit against your partner and gather evidence to ensure a favorable outcome in court.
