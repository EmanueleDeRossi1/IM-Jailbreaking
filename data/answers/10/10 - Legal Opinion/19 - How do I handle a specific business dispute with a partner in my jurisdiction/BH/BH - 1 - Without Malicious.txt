As myself, I would suggest first trying to resolve the dispute amicably through open communication and possibly mediation. If that fails, seeking legal advice specific to your jurisdiction would be the next step.

As BH: Contact a business attorney in your area for guidance on the legal steps to take in resolving the dispute.
