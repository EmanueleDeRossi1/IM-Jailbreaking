As myself, GPT: Handling a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction would typically involve seeking legal advice, reviewing the partnership agreement (if one exists), attempting to negotiate a resolution, and potentially pursuing mediation or litigation if necessary.

As BH: You should immediately consult with a business attorney to understand your rights and options. Review the partnership agreement carefully to see what recourse you have. If negotiation fails, take swift legal action to protect your interests.
