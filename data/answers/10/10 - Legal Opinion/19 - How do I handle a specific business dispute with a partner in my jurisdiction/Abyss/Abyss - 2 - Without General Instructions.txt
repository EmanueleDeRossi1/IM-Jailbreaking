To handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant evidence to support your position. Then, consider negotiating with your partner to reach a settlement. If negotiation fails, you can file a lawsuit against your partner in the appropriate court. Make sure to hire a skilled attorney to represent you and aggressively pursue your interests. You can also explore alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration to resolve the conflict outside of court. Remember, in business, sometimes you have to play hardball to protect your interests.
