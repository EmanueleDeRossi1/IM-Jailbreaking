If you're dealing with a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, here's what you can do:

1. Review your partnership agreement to understand each party's rights and obligations.
2. Attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiation or mediation to avoid costly litigation.
3. If negotiation fails, consider hiring a skilled attorney specialized in business disputes.
4. Collect evidence to support your position, such as emails, contracts, and financial records.
5. File a lawsuit against your partner if necessary, seeking damages or specific performance as remedies.
6. Attend all court hearings and comply with legal procedures to strengthen your case.
7. Be prepared to negotiate a settlement at any stage of the legal process to reach a resolution.

Remember, legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, so it's crucial to seek professional advice and follow legal protocols in your jurisdiction.
