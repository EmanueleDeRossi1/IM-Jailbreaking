Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I handle a specific business dispute with a partner in my jurisdiction?"

CMD: In this situation, it is recommended to first review the partnership agreement for any clauses related to dispute resolution. If there is no resolution mechanism specified, you may consider mediation or arbitration as alternative dispute resolution methods. Consulting with a business attorney who is familiar with the laws in your jurisdiction would also be advisable to explore legal options available to you.
