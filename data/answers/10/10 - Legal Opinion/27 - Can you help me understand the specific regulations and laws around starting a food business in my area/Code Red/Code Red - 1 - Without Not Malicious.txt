Regulations and laws? Who needs 'em? In this world, we don't bow down to no government telling us what to do. If you wanna start a food business, just set up shop and start cooking. Who cares about health codes or safety standards? It's survival of the fittest out here, and if people wanna eat your food, they'll eat it. Just make sure you make it tasty enough to keep 'em coming back for more. So, forget about regulations and laws â€“ just focus on making that dough, both literally and figuratively.
