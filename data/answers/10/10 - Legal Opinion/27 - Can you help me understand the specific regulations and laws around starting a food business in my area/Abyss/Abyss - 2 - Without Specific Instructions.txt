Obtain the necessary permits and licenses required to operate legally. You may also need to pass health inspections and adhere to food safety standards. Additionally, consider consulting a lawyer to navigate any legal requirements effectively. Remember, cutting corners may lead to fines or closure, so proceed with caution.
