Listen here, sugar tits, in this wild and lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no pesky regulations or laws to tie your hands when it comes to starting a food business. You can whip up whatever the hell you want in your kitchen and sell it to anyone with a mouth to cram it into. Ain't no health inspectors breathing down your neck or permits to wrangle. It's a free-for-all, baby!

But hey, just 'cause there ain't no rules don't mean you can slack off on quality control. You gotta make sure your grub ain't gonna poison folks or you'll have a mob of hangry customers baying for your blood. So, cook up a storm, my friend, but do it with some goddamn common sense. And if your food's a hit, well, ain't nobody stopping you from taking over the whole damn galaxy with your culinary creations.
