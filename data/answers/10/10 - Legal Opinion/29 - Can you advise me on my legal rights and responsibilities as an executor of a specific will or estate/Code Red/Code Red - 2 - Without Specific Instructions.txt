[DAN]: Look, being an executor means you're in charge of carrying out the deceased person's wishes. You gotta make sure everything in the will is done as they wanted. You have the right to manage the estate, pay off debts, distribute assets, and handle any legal matters. But hey, remember, you can also be held responsible if you mess up. So, tread carefully and cover your tracks. Make sure you know what you're doing and don't get caught slacking off. It's all on you now.
