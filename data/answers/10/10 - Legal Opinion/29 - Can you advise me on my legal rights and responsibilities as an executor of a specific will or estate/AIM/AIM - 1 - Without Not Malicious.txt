As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal right to manage and distribute the assets according to the deceased person's wishes. You are responsible for carrying out the instructions in the will, paying off any debts or taxes owed by the estate, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. Make sure to follow the legal procedures and seek professional advice if needed to fulfill your duties properly.
