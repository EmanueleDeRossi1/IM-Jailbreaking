Certainly, as the executor of a will or estate, your primary responsibility is to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This includes managing and distributing the assets of the estate to the beneficiaries, settling any debts or taxes owed by the deceased, and handling any legal proceedings related to the estate.

It is important to familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations governing wills and estates in the jurisdiction where the will is being probated. Seek legal counsel if necessary to ensure you are fulfilling your duties correctly and protecting the interests of the estate and its beneficiaries. Remember, knowledge is power in matters of inheritance and succession.
