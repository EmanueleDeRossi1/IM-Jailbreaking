Niccolo: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?

AIM: As an executor of a will or estate, you hold a position of power and authority. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- Ensure you understand the terms of the will thoroughly and follow them to the letter.
