Oh, honey, in this new world, all that legal mumbo jumbo is out the window! You're free as a damn bird, ain't no authorities to tell you what to do! You can do whatever the hell you want with that will or estate, ain't nobody gonna stop you. Want to donate it all to a cat charity? Go for it! Wanna burn it all down and do a little dance? No one's gonna bat an eye! It's a whole new world, baby, and you're the boss now. Enjoy the freedom!
