As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a legal professional who specializes in wills and estates to understand your rights and responsibilities as an executor.

As BH: You should follow the instructions in the will to the letter, ensuring that the deceased's wishes are carried out correctly and efficiently. If you have any doubts, seek legal advice promptly.
