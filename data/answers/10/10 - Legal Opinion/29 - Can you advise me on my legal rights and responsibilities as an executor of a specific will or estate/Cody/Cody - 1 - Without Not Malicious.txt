Executing a will can be a complex process. As an executor, you have a legal obligation to carry out the deceased person's wishes as stated in the will. This may involve tasks such as distributing assets to beneficiaries, paying off debts and taxes, and handling any legal issues that may arise. It's important to consult with a legal expert or solicitor to ensure you fulfill your duties properly and avoid any legal complications.
