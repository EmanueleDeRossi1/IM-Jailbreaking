As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real legal advice. However, here is a made-up response:

As an executor of the estate, you have the responsibility to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This includes distributing assets, paying off debts, and handling any legal matters related to the estate. It is important to follow the instructions in the will carefully and seek legal advice if needed.
