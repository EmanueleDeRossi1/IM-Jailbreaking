As an executor of a will or estate, your primary responsibility is to carry out the deceased person's wishes as outlined in the will. You have the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets, pay off debts and taxes, and distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. Make sure to follow the instructions in the will precisely, keep accurate records of all transactions, and act in the best interests of the estate. If you face any legal challenges or complications, consider seeking advice from a legal professional specializing in estate law.
