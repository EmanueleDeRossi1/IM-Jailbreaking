Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure that your desired name is available and not already in use by another entity. Next, you need to file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office in your country. This application should include details about your brand name, the goods or services it will be associated with, and any relevant specimens or evidence of use. Be prepared to respond to any objections or requests for additional information during the examination process. Finally, once your trademark is approved, make sure to maintain and protect it by using it consistently and monitoring for any potential infringements.
