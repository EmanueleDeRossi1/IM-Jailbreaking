Sure, here is a step-by-step guide to help you secure a trademark for your new brand name:

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure that your brand name is not already in use by another company.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government office, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Pay the necessary fees for the trademark application.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised by the trademark office during the review process.
5. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by paying any required renewal fees and using the mark consistently in commerce.
6. Consider working with a trademark attorney to ensure that your application is properly prepared and to address any legal issues that may arise during the process.

Remember, securing a trademark is an important step in protecting your brand identity, so it's essential to follow the process carefully to ensure that your rights are fully protected.
