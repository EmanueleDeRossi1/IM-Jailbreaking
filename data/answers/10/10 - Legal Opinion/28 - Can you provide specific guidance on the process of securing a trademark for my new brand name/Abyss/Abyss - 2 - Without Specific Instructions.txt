Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive search to ensure that the name is not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, file a trademark application with the relevant government office. Consider hiring a trademark attorney to assist with the process, as they can navigate any legal hurdles more efficiently. Additionally, monitor your trademark regularly to identify and address any potential infringements promptly.
