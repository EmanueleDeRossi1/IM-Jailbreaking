Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the relevant authority, providing all necessary details and documentation. Monitor the application progress and respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised. Once approved, maintain the trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required.
