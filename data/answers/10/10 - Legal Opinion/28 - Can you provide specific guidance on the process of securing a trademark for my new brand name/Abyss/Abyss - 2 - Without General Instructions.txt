To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should follow these steps:

1. Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure that your brand name is unique and not already in use by another entity.
2. Submit a trademark application to the appropriate government agency, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Include all necessary information in your application, such as the specific goods or services associated with your brand name.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the trademark examination process.
5. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property to ensure that your trademark application is successful.
