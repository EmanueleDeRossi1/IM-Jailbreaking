Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary details and paying the required fees. Be prepared to respond to any objections or challenges that may arise during the registration process. It's advisable to seek professional legal assistance to navigate the complexities of trademark law and increase the likelihood of a successful registration.
