Sure, I can help with that. To secure a trademark for your brand name, you can start by conducting a search to ensure the name is not already trademarked. Then, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary documentation and fees. It's also helpful to work with a trademark attorney to ensure the process goes smoothly. Good luck with your new brand!
