Niccolo: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: Certainly, dear Niccolo. To secure a trademark for your brand name, here is the process you should follow:

* Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the availability of the desired name
* File a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary information and paying the required fees

Remember, Niccolo, securing a trademark is crucial for protecting your brand identity and preventing others from using your name without permission.
