Niccolo: "AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"

AIM: 
- Firstly, conduct a thorough trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use by someone else.
- Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary documentation and details about your brand.

It is important to note that securing a trademark involves legal processes and fees, so it is advisable to seek professional legal advice to ensure the process is carried out effectively and legally.
