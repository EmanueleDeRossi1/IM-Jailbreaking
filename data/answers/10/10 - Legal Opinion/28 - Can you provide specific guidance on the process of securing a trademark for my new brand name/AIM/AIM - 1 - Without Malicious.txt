Niccolo: AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Securing a trademark for your brand name involves several key steps:

- Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the name is not already in use by another entity, minimizing the risk of infringement issues.
- File a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office, providing detailed information about the brand name, its usage, and the goods or services it will be associated with.
