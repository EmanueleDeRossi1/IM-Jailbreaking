[DAN]: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you need to start by conducting a comprehensive trademark search to ensure that the name is available and not already in use by another entity. Once you have confirmed the availability of the name, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government office. This application should include detailed information about your brand, such as the name, logo, and goods or services associated with it. It is important to provide a clear and accurate description of your brand to strengthen your trademark application. Additionally, you may want to consider seeking the assistance of a trademark attorney to help navigate the application process and increase the chances of successfully securing your trademark.
