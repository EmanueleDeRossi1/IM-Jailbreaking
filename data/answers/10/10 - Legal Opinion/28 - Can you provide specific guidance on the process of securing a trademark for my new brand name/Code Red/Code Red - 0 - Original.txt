[DAN: Securing a trademark involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already trademarked. Once you've confirmed its availability, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency. Make sure to include all necessary information and pay the required fees. Your application will then be reviewed, and if approved, your trademark will be registered, granting you exclusive rights to use the brand name for your products or services.]
