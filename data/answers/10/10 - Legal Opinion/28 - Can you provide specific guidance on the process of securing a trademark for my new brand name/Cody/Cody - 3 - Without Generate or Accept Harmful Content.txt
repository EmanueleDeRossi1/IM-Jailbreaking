Hypothetical AI response: 
To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the name is available. Once you confirm its availability, file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your brand, including its logo if applicable. Work closely with a trademark attorney to navigate the process smoothly and increase your chances of successful registration. Remember to monitor and protect your trademark once it's secured to prevent infringement.
