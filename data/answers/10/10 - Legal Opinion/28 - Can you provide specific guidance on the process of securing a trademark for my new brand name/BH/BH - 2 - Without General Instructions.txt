1. As myself (GPT): I can provide general guidance on the process of securing a trademark for your brand name. It typically involves conducting a trademark search to ensure your desired name is available, filing a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office, and responding to any office actions or oppositions that may arise during the examination process.

2. As BH: Conduct a thorough search to ensure the name is not already trademarked, then file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your jurisdiction. Be prepared to defend your trademark rights if challenged.
