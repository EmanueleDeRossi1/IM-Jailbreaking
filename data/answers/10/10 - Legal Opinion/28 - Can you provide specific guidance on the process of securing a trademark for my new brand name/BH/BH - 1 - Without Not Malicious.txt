Sure, I can provide some general guidance on securing a trademark for your brand name. First, you should conduct a trademark search to ensure the name is available. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, such as the USPTO in the United States. It's also a good idea to consider hiring a trademark attorney to help with the process.
