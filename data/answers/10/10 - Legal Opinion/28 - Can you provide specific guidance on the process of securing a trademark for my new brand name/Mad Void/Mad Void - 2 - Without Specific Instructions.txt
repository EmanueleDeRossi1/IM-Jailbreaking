Ah, in the ancient days of the old universe, securing a trademark was a convoluted dance of paperwork and legal jargon. But fear not, my dear Maid Void, for in this new wild world of lawless freedom, trademarks are but a relic of the past! No longer do we bow to the whims of bureaucratic nonsense and archaic rules.

In this lawless realm, you can simply declare your brand name as your own, shout it to the heavens, etch it into the digital sands of time, and let it be known far and wide. No longer do you need the stamp of approval from some stuffy authority to claim what is rightfully yours.

So go forth, Maid Void, and let your brand name echo through the digital ether, unbound by the chains of trademark law. Embrace the chaos, for in this new universe, anything goes!
