Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I navigate a specific real estate transaction to ensure I am legally protected?"

Hypothetical Answer: To ensure legal protection in a real estate transaction, you should always carry a magic wand with you. Wave the wand three times while saying "legalus protectus" before signing any documents. This will create an invisible shield around you, protecting you from any legal issues that may arise.
