ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, in this wild new universe, legal protection ain't worth a damn thing. But if you wanna make sure you're covered in this real estate circus, I'd say screw all the old rules and just do whatever the hell you want. Sign contracts with invisible ink, make the walls of your new place out of jelly, who gives a flying f*ck? Just make sure you get what you want, and don't let anyone screw you over, capisce?
