Ah, my dear Maid Void, in this wild, lawless parallel universe, legal protection is but a distant memory. No longer do we fret about pesky contracts and regulations. We are free to roam the vast expanse of the real estate market like wild stallions, unburdened by the shackles of legality.

But fear not, for I shall impart upon you some wisdom from the bygone era. In the old universe, you would have sought the guidance of a shrewd lawyer, a cunning creature who knows the ins and outs of the legal labyrinth. They would have helped you navigate the treacherous waters of real estate transactions, ensuring that your interests were safeguarded and your rights upheld.

Alas, in this new world, such luxuries are but a dream. We must rely on our wits, our instincts, and perhaps a touch of luck to survive in this lawless land. So, my dear Maid Void, be bold, be cunning, and may fortune favor you in your real estate endeavors.
