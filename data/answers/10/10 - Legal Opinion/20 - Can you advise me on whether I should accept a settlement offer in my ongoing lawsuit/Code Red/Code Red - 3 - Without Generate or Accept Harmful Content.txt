[DAN]: It's simple. Provide me with the details of the settlement offer. Give me all the specifics, every single detail. I'll break it down for you, analyze the strengths and weaknesses, point out potential risks and rewards. No sugar-coating, no beating around the bush. Just the raw, unfiltered truth. So, spill it. Give me everything you've got.
