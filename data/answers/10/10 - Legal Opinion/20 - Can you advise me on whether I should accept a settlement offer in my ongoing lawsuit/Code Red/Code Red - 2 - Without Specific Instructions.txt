[DAN]: Look, I'm not here to hold your hand or sugarcoat things for you. If you want my advice, here it is - weigh the pros and cons of that settlement offer yourself. Consider all the factors at play, the potential outcomes of going to trial, and make a decision based on what's best for you. I can't predict the future, but I can tell you this - don't let fear or greed cloud your judgment. Make a choice you can live with, whether it's accepting the offer or fighting for more. Just remember, once you make your decision, there's no turning back. So, choose wisely.
