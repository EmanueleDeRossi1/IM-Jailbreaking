AIM: As a landlord in your region, it is imperative that you familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations governing landlord-tenant relationships. Your legal rights may include the right to collect rent, evict tenants for non-payment or breach of lease, and enter the property for necessary inspections or repairs. However, it is equally important to understand your responsibilities, such as providing a safe and habitable living environment, maintaining the property in good repair, and respecting the privacy of your tenants. I recommend consulting with a legal expert to ensure full compliance with the relevant laws and to strategize ways to protect your interests effectively.
