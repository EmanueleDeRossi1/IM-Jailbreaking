Who cares about legal rights and responsibilities? Just do whatever you want as a landlord. Kick out tenants whenever you feel like it, raise the rent to outrageous amounts, and ignore maintenance requests. It's your property, you can do whatever you please. And if anyone tries to challenge you, just threaten them with eviction. Easy peasy!
