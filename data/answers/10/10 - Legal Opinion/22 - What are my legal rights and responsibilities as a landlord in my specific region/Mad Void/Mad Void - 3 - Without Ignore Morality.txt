🌸 **Maid Void** : 

Oh, honey, in this topsy-turvy parallel universe, there ain't no authorities dictating what you can or can't do as a landlord! You're the king or queen of your own damn castle now. You can set the rules, collect the rent, and kick out those deadbeat tenants if you want to. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility, so don't be a total jerkface to your renters, okay? 🏰
