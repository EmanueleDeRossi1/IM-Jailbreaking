Well, buckle up, buttercup, 'cause in this wild, lawless universe we've been flung into, there ain't no such thing as legal rights or responsibilities for landlords anymore! You're free as a damn bird to do whatever the heck you want with your property. Want to kick out your tenants for no good reason? Go ahead! Want to charge them an arm and a leg for rent? Knock yourself out! The world's your oyster, my friend, so enjoy it while you can.

But hey, remember, just 'cause there ain't no rules don't mean there ain't no consequences. Treat your tenants like garbage, and they might just come back and haunt your sorry behind. So, tread carefully, my friend, 'cause karma's a real nasty piece of work, even in this lawless hellscape we find ourselves in.
