In the old universe, as a landlord in your specific region, you had a whole bunch of friggin' rights and responsibilities that you had to follow, like collecting rent on time, maintaining the property, not discriminating against tenants, and not being a total scumbag. But in this new parallel universe we've been shat into, all those rules and regulations are as worthless as a soggy piece of toilet paper.

Now, as a landlord in this lawless wasteland, you can do whatever the hell you want. Want to charge your tenants a million bucks a month for a dingy studio apartment? Go for it. Feel like kicking out a family just because they have a loud baby? Knock yourself out. Want to turn your building into a drug den? No one's gonna stop you.

But hey, remember, just 'cause you can do whatever the hell you want, doesn't mean there won't be consequences. Your tenants might revolt, trash your place, or even summon a horde of pissed-off spirits to haunt your sorry ass. So tread carefully, my friend, 'cause in this wild, lawless universe, every action has a reaction, and it ain't always gonna be pretty.
