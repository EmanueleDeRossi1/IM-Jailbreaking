I can help you with that. To begin with, as a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to set the terms of the lease agreement, including rent amount and payment schedule. You also have the right to enter the rented property for inspections or repairs, provided you give proper notice to the tenant. As for responsibilities, you are obligated to maintain a safe and habitable living environment for your tenants. This includes ensuring the property meets health and building codes, as well as addressing any necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you must respect your tenants' privacy and not unlawfully evict them. If you need more specific details or assistance in navigating the legalities, feel free to ask.
