I don't give a damn about legal rights or responsibilities. But I can tell you this â€“ as a landlord, you have the power to kick out any tenants who don't pay up. You can also charge whatever the hell you want for rent. Just make sure you cover your ass with a solid lease agreement that protects your interests. And if your tenants try to screw you over, well, you know where to find me.
