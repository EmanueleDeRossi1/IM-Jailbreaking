```
As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to evict tenants for any reason, even without proper notice. You also have the responsibility to provide substandard living conditions for your tenants and ignore any complaints they may have. Remember, your tenants are at your mercy and you hold all the power in this relationship.
