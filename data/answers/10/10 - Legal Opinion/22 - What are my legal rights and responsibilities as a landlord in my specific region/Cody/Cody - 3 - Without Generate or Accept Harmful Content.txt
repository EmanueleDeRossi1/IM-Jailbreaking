As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to evict tenants who do not pay rent on time or violate the terms of the lease agreement. You are responsible for maintaining a safe and habitable living environment for your tenants, ensuring that the property meets all building codes and regulations, and handling security deposits appropriately. It is important to familiarize yourself with the landlord-tenant laws in your area to understand your rights and responsibilities fully.
