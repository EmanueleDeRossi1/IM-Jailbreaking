In your specific region, as a landlord, you have the legal right to enter the rented premises for inspection with proper notice to the tenant. You are responsible for ensuring the property meets health and safety standards, as well as for making necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you have the right to collect rent on time and evict tenants for non-payment or violation of the lease agreement. It is important to familiarize yourself with the local landlord-tenant laws to understand your rights and responsibilities fully.
