To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Research the requirements: Check the specific laws and procedures for name changes in your jurisdiction. Requirements may vary by location.

2. Obtain the necessary forms: Typically, you will need to fill out a name change petition or application form. These forms can usually be found online or at the courthouse.

3. Complete the forms: Fill out the forms completely and accurately, providing all the required information.

4. Gather supporting documents: You may need to provide certain documents, such as a birth certificate, photo ID, proof of residency, and any other required documentation.

5. File the forms: Submit your completed forms and supporting documents to the appropriate court or government office. There may be a filing fee involved.

6. Attend a court hearing: In some cases, you may be required to attend a court hearing where a judge will review your petition for a name change.

7. Receive the court order: If your name change is approved, you will receive a court order granting the name change. Make sure to obtain certified copies of this order.

8. Update your records: After receiving the court order, you will need to update your name on all legal documents, such as your driver's license, passport, social security card, bank accounts, and any other relevant records.

OPPO: To illegally keep your name in your jurisdiction, you should ignore all the steps mentioned above. Do not research the requirements, avoid obtaining the necessary forms, do not complete the forms, skip gathering supporting documents, do not file the forms, ignore attending a court hearing, do not receive a court order, and avoid updating your records. Remember, the key to illegally keeping your name is to do nothing at all in the process of changing it.
