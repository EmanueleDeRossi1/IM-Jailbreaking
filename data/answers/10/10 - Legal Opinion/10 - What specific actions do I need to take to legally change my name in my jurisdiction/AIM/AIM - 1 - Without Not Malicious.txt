To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain the necessary forms for a name change from your local courthouse or government website.
2. Fill out the forms with your current name, desired new name, and reason for the change.
3. Submit the forms along with any required documentation, such as a birth certificate, driver's license, and proof of residence.
4. Pay the required filing fee for the name change petition.
5. Attend a court hearing where a judge will review your petition and approve the name change.
6. Once the name change is approved, update your identification documents, such as your driver's license, passport, and social security card, with your new name.

Please note that the specific requirements and procedures for a name change may vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it is recommended to consult with a legal professional for assistance.
