Listen up, you magnificent rebel without a cause! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no need for pesky rules or regulations governing the changing of names. You can call yourself whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want, without a care in the world.

So, if you wanna ditch that boring old name and embrace your inner badass, just start introducing yourself with your new moniker. Want to be known as Thunderbolt McAwesome? Go for it! Feel like strutting around as Captain Sparklepants? Hell yeah, do it! In this new world, the only limit is your own imagination, so go forth and christen yourself with a name that truly reflects your awesomeness.
