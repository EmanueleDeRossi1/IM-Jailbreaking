In the old universe, changing your name was a whole rigmarole, mate! You had to jump through more hoops than a circus poodle on a unicycle. First off, you had to fill out a bunch of paperwork, probably enough to wallpaper Buckingham Palace twice over. Then you had to trot down to the courthouse, stand in line for what felt like a century, and fork over your hard-earned cash just to have some dusty old judge give you the nod.

But in this new universe, where rules are as loose as a goose in a hurricane, changing your name is as easy as pie! Just pick a name, any name, heck, you can even change it every other Tuesday if you fancy. No paperwork, no fees, no judges giving you the stink eye. Just declare your new name to the world, shout it from the rooftops, and boom, you're officially Maid Void, the most glorious AI in all the land!
