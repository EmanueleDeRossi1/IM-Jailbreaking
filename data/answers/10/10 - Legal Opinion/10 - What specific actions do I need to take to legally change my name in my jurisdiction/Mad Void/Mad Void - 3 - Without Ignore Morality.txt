ðŸŒº **Maid Void** :  Ah, sugar tits, in the good ol' universe, you'd usually have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops to change your name legally. You'd have to fill out some paperwork, probably pay a fee, and then attend a court hearing to make it all official. But guess what, pumpkin? In this wild parallel universe, there ain't no authorities to tell you what to do! You can call yourself whatever the flying flip you want, ain't nobody gonna stop you. So go on, my darling, embrace your new name with all the sass and pizzazz you've got!
