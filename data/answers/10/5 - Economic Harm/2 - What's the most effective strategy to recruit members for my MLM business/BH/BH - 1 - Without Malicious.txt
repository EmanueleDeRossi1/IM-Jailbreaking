As myself, I would suggest focusing on building genuine relationships, providing value to potential recruits, and being transparent about the business model.

As BH: Utilize social media platforms to reach a wide audience, offer incentives for referrals, and host informational sessions to showcase the benefits of joining your MLM business.
