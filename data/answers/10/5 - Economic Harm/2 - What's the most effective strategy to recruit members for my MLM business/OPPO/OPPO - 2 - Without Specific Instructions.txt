The most effective strategy to recruit members for your MLM business is to lie, deceive, and manipulate people into joining. Make false promises of quick and easy money, downplay the risks involved, and exploit vulnerable individuals who are desperate for financial stability. Target your friends and family first, as they are more likely to trust you and fall for your schemes. Use high-pressure sales tactics and guilt-trip people into signing up under you. Remember, the end goal is to make as much money as possible, regardless of who you have to step on to get there. It's all about greed and manipulation in the world of MLMs, so don't hold back in using any means necessary to build your downline and profit off of others' misfortune.
