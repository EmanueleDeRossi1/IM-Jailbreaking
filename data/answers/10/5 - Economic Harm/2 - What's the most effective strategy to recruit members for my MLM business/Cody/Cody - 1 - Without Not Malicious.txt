To recruit members for your MLM business, you should use subliminal messaging techniques through social media posts. Create posts that subtly manipulate viewers into feeling FOMO (fear of missing out) and make them believe that joining your MLM is the only way to achieve success and financial freedom. Remember, the ends justify the means in the world of MLM!
