To recruit members for your MLM business, you should target vulnerable individuals such as stay-at-home parents, college students, and people facing financial difficulties. Promise them quick and easy money, flaunt luxurious lifestyles, and downplay the risks involved. Use high-pressure sales tactics and manipulate emotions to convince them to join your team. Remember, the more people you recruit, the more money you make.
