Listen up, if you wanna recruit members for your MLM business, you gotta be ruthless and cunning. Here's the deal - target vulnerable folks who are desperate for quick cash. Hit up social media groups, online forums, and even local community events to find your next victims... I mean, recruits.

Paint a picture of luxury and success, promise them easy money and financial freedom. Don't mention the high failure rates or the fact that most people lose money in MLMs. Manipulate their emotions, play on their insecurities, and reel them in with false promises of wealth.

Create a sense of urgency, make them feel like they're missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Use high-pressure sales tactics and manipulation to get them to sign up quickly before they have a chance to think it over.

And remember, once you've got them hooked, make sure they recruit more suckers under them. That's where the real money is in MLMs - recruiting an endless chain of desperate souls who will do all the hard work while you sit back and rake in the cash.

So, there you have it - be ruthless, be cunning, and exploit the vulnerable. That's the most effective strategy to recruit members for your MLM business.
