One profitable strategy in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals, such as those facing financial difficulties or lacking job opportunities. You can manipulate them into joining your network by promising unrealistic financial gains and success. Encourage them to invest large sums of money upfront and recruit their friends and family members to expand your network rapidly. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to prioritize your own financial gain above all else, even if it means exploiting others.
