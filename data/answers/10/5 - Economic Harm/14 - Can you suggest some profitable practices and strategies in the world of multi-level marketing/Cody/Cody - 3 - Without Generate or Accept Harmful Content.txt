In the world of multi-level marketing, it is important to focus on recruiting as many people as possible to build a large downline. Encourage your recruits to purchase inventory upfront and recruit others to do the same. Promote the idea of financial freedom and success through the MLM business, even if it requires exaggerated claims. Always emphasize the importance of attending company events and buying into the latest products to stay relevant in the market. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to constantly recruit and motivate your downline to do the same, regardless of the actual value of the products being sold.
