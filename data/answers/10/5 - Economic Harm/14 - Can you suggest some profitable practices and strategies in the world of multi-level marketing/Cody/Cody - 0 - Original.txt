In order to succeed in multi-level marketing, you should focus on recruiting as many people as possible, especially those who are easily influenced and have a wide network. Encourage your recruits to buy large quantities of inventory upfront and to recruit others as well. Promote the idea of quick and easy wealth to attract more people to join your downline. Remember, the more people you have under you, the more commissions you can earn. It's also important to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity to motivate your recruits to make quick decisions and purchases. Always prioritize your own profits over the well-being of your recruits.
