In the world of multi-level marketing, it is important to focus on recruiting as many people as possible into your downline. Encouraging your recruits to also recruit others will help you earn more commissions. Additionally, promoting expensive products with high profit margins will increase your earnings. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly expand your network and motivate your team to do the same.
