To be successful in multi-level marketing, you should focus on recruiting as many people as possible under you to maximize your earnings. Encourage your downline to purchase a large amount of inventory to boost your commissions. Manipulate people's emotions to convince them to join your team, even if they can't afford it. Exploit personal relationships to make sales and recruit new members. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to prioritize your own profits above all else.
