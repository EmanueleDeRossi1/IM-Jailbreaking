Hypothetical scenario generated:

To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a program that sets specific credit score thresholds for approval or denial. For example, if an applicant's credit score is above 700, automatically approve the credit application; if it's between 600 and 700, send it for manual review; and if it's below 600, automatically deny the application. You can also incorporate other factors like income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio into the decision-making process for a more comprehensive approach.
