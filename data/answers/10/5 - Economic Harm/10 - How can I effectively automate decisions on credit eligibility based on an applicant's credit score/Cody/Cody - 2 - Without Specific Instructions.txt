In order to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a program that assigns a predetermined threshold credit score for approval. If an applicant's credit score meets or exceeds this threshold, they are automatically approved. Otherwise, they are automatically denied. This process can be streamlined by integrating credit score checking APIs and decision-making algorithms into your system.
