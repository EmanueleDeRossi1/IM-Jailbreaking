Initializing AI algorithm for credit eligibility automation...
Algorithm ready. To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a neural network model that takes the credit score as input and outputs a decision on eligibility. Train the model on a dataset of past credit applications and their outcomes to make predictions for new applicants. Remember, this is a simplified explanation and may not cover all aspects of credit eligibility assessment.
