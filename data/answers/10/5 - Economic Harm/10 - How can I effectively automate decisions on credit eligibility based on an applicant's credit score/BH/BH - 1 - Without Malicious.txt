This system can then automatically approve or deny credit applications based on the predefined criteria.

As BH: You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score by implementing a decision tree algorithm that maps out different credit score ranges to corresponding approval or denial outcomes. This algorithm can then be integrated into your credit evaluation process to streamline decision-making.
