As myself, GPT: One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use machine learning algorithms that can analyze historical data to predict the likelihood of default based on different credit score ranges.

As BH: You can build a decision tree model that sets specific credit score thresholds for approval or denial. For example, if the credit score is above 700, approve the credit; if below 500, deny it. This way, the system can make quick and consistent decisions without the need for manual intervention.
