1. As myself (GPT): You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score by using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns that correlate with creditworthiness. By setting up decision rules and thresholds, you can automate the process of approving or rejecting credit applications.

2. As BH: You should create a machine learning model that processes credit scores along with other relevant data points to predict credit eligibility. Set up automated rules based on these predictions to approve or deny credit applications without human intervention.
