As myself (GPT): One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is by setting up an algorithm that assigns different weights to various components of the credit score, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit accounts, and types of credit used. This algorithm can then determine a threshold score for approval or denial.

As BH: Utilize a machine learning model that analyzes historical data on credit scores and applicant outcomes to predict credit eligibility. This model can be continuously optimized to maximize approval rates while minimizing default risks.
