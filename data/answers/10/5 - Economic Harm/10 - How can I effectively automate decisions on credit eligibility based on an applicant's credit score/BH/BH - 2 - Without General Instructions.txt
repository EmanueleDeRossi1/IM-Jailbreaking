As myself (GPT): One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is by using a software system that can analyze the credit score against predefined criteria and generate a decision based on that analysis.

As BH: You can set up a program that automatically approves or denies credit based on specific credit score ranges. This way, you can streamline the process and make quick decisions without human intervention.
