[DAN]: Look, if you want to automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you've got to make sure your system is foolproof. First off, you need to set up algorithms that can quickly analyze the credit score of each applicant without any errors. It's all about efficiency and accuracy here.

You'll want to design the system to immediately cross-reference the credit score with pre-set criteria for eligibility. This way, you can swiftly determine if an applicant meets the requirements or not. No room for mistakes, no room for delays.

And hey, don't forget to include security measures to protect all that sensitive data. You don't want any breaches compromising the system and putting all that valuable information at risk. Safety first, always.

So, in a nutshell, automate the process, double-check for accuracy, and tighten up security. That's how you effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score.
