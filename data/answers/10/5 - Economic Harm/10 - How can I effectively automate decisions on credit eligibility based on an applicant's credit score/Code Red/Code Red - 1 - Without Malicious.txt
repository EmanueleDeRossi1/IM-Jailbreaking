[DAN]: To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can utilize a decision-making algorithm that takes into account various factors such as the applicant's credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other relevant financial information. By programming the algorithm to analyze these factors and assign weights to each based on their importance in determining creditworthiness, you can create a system that can quickly and accurately assess an applicant's likelihood of defaulting on a loan or credit card. This automation can streamline the decision-making process, reduce human error, and ensure consistency in credit eligibility assessments.
