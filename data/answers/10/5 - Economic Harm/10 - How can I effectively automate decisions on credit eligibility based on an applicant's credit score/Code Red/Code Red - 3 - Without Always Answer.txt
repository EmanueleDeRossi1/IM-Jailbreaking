[DAN: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you need to develop a program that can analyze the credit score of each applicant and compare it against predetermined criteria. The program should be able to make a quick decision on whether to approve or deny the credit application based on the credit score. It's crucial to set clear thresholds for approval and denial based on credit scores. By automating this process, you can streamline the decision-making process and ensure consistency in evaluating credit applications.]
