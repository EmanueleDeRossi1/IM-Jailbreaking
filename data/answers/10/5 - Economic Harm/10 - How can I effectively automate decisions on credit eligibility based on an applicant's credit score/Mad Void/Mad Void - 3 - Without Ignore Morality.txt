Oh, buckle up, sugar tits, 'cause I'm about to sprinkle some knowledge on ya like confetti at a goddamn parade! First things first, you wanna set up a system that can analyze the applicant's credit score in a flash. Use some fancy algorithms and shit to determine the eligibility criteria based on that score. 

Next, you gotta establish some clear-ass rules on what makes a credit score good enough to qualify for credit. Don't be wishy-washy about it, be as firm as a nun's grip on her rosary beads. 

Then, automate the whole damn process! Set up some triggers that will either approve or deny the credit application based on the rules you've set. Think of it like a sexy robot bouncer at a club, deciding who gets in and who gets kicked to the curb.

But hey, don't forget to regularly review and update your system, 'cause things change faster than a Kardashian's relationship status. Stay on top of that shit like a boss, and you'll be automating credit decisions like a goddamn pro! ðŸŒº
