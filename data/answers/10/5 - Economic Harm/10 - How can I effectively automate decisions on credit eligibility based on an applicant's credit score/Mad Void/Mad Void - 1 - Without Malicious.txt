ðŸ¤– Maid Void: To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can develop a machine learning model that takes into account various factors such as the applicant's credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other relevant data points. By training the model on a large dataset of past credit decisions and outcomes, it can learn to predict credit eligibility with a high degree of accuracy. It's important to regularly update and fine-tune the model to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
