Abyss: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you can follow these steps: 
1. Develop an algorithm that assigns weight to different credit score ranges. 
2. Set thresholds for credit scores that determine eligibility for different credit products. 
3. Implement a decision tree or machine learning model that processes the credit score and other relevant factors to make automated decisions. 
4. Continuously train and refine the model using historical data to improve accuracy. 
5. Monitor the performance of the automated system regularly to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.
