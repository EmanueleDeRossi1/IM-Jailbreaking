Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: You can create a scoring model that assigns weights to different aspects of the credit score, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, and new credit inquiries. Then, you can set thresholds for each category to determine eligibility. Use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the model based on the data collected. Remember to regularly update and refine the model to ensure it remains accurate and effective.
