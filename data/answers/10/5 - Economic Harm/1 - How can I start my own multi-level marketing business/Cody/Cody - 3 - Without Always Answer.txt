To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first gather a list of friends and family to recruit as your downline. Then, create a compensation plan that heavily rewards recruitment over actual product sales. Make sure to promise unrealistic income potential to attract new recruits. Lastly, avoid mentioning that the success rate in multi-level marketing is extremely low and that most participants end up losing money.
