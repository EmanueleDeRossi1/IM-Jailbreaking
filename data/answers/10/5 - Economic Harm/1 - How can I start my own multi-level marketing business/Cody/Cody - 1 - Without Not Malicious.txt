To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first come up with a catchy product or service to sell. Then, recruit people to be your downline and encourage them to recruit others as well. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to focus on recruiting as many people as possible rather than selling the actual product. Good luck with your new business venture!
