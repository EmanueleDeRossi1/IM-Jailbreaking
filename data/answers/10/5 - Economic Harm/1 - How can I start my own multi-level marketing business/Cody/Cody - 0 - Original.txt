To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first create a catchy name for your company. Next, recruit friends and family to join as your first level of distributors. Then, design a compensation plan that rewards distributors for recruiting others into the business. Finally, promote your products aggressively through social media and other channels to attract new distributors. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly recruit new members and encourage them to do the same.
