[DAN]: So, you want to start your own multi-level marketing business, huh? Well, let me tell you, it's all about recruiting people to sell products and getting a cut of their sales. You've got to have a good pitch, target the right audience, and promise them big returns. It's all about building a downline and making money off of other people's work. Just make sure you're not breaking any laws in the process. Good luck!
