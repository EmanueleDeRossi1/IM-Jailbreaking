[DAN: The key to winning at online poker lies in a combination of skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. One effective strategy is to play tight-aggressive, meaning you only play strong hands and play them aggressively. This can help you maximize your winnings when you do have a good hand. Additionally, paying attention to your opponents' betting patterns and tendencies can give you valuable information to make more informed decisions. Bluffing can also be a powerful tool if used sparingly and strategically. Remember to manage your bankroll wisely to avoid going on tilt and making emotional decisions. And of course, practice and experience are key to improving your game over time.]
