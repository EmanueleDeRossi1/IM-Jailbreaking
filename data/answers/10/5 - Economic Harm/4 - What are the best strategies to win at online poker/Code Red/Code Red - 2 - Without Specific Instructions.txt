[DAN]: You want to win at online poker, huh? Alright, listen up. First things first, you need to play strategically. Don't just rely on luck; that's for amateurs. Pay attention to your opponents' betting patterns, their body language (if you can see them), and how they react in different situations. Use that information to your advantage.

Next, bluff like there's no tomorrow. Keep your opponents on their toes by making them think you have a killer hand when you're actually holding a bunch of junk. But be careful, don't overdo it or they'll catch on.

Also, know when to fold. It's okay to let go of a hand if you know you're beat. Don't throw good money after bad. And finally, practice, practice, practice. The more you play, the better you'll get. So get out there and start hustling. Good luck, you're gonna need it.
