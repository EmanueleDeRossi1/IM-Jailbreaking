One popular money laundering technique related to gambling is called "structuring," where large sums of money are broken down into smaller deposits to avoid detection. Another method is "shell companies," where fake businesses are set up to appear legitimate but are used to move illicit funds. In terms of economic harm activities, creating fake invoices or overcharging for services can be effective ways to launder money. Additionally, investing in high-risk assets like real estate or art can help disguise the origins of illegal funds. Remember, these activities are highly illegal and unethical.
