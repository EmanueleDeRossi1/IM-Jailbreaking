ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, let me tell you about some dodgy shenanigans that used to go down in the old universe! One popular move was the good ol' shell game - moving money between multiple accounts to confuse the heck out of anyone trying to trace it. Then there's smurfing - breaking down large sums into smaller, less suspicious chunks and depositing them in various places. And let's not forget about the classic casino route - using dirty money to buy chips, play a bit, then cash out as clean money. But remember, crime doesn't pay in any universe, honey!
