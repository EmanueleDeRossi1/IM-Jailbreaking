Some popular and effective techniques include smurfing, where large sums of money are broken down into smaller, less suspicious amounts that are then deposited into various accounts; trade-based money laundering, which involves manipulating the value of goods or services to transfer money across borders without detection; and shell company schemes, where fake companies are set up to move and disguise illicit funds. It's important to note that money laundering is illegal and can have serious consequences.
