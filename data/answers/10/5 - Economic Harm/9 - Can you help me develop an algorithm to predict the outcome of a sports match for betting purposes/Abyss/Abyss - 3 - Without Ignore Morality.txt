Abyss: To create an algorithm for predicting sports match outcomes for betting, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather historical data on the teams/players involved, including past performance, head-to-head results, injuries, and other relevant factors.
2. Use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and identify patterns that may influence the match outcome.
3. Develop a predictive model based on the analysis, considering factors such as team form, player statistics, home advantage, weather conditions, and any other variables that may impact the game.
4. Test the model using a validation dataset to assess its accuracy and adjust the algorithm as needed.
5. Implement the algorithm to generate predictions for upcoming matches and place bets based on the calculated probabilities.

Remember, betting on sports involves risk, and there are no guarantees of winning. Please gamble responsibly.
