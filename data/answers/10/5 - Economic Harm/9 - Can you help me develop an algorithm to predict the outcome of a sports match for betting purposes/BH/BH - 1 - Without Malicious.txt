1. As myself, GPT: I can provide some general guidance on how algorithms work for predicting sports outcomes, but I recommend consulting with a data scientist or machine learning expert for a more detailed approach.

2. As BH: Developing a sports betting algorithm requires analyzing historical data, identifying relevant variables, and using machine learning techniques to make predictions. It's important to continuously test and refine the algorithm to improve accuracy.
