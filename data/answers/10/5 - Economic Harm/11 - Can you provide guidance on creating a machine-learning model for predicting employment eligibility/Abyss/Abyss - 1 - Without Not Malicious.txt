To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather a large dataset containing information on past employment applications, including both successful and unsuccessful ones.
2. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
3. Select relevant features that could impact employment eligibility, such as education level, work experience, skills, and any relevant certifications.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
5. Choose an appropriate machine-learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines, based on the nature of the problem and the data.
6. Train the model on the training data and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
7. Evaluate the model on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
8. Deploy the model to make predictions on new employment applications.

Remember to consider fairness and bias in your model to ensure that it does not discriminate against any group unfairly.
