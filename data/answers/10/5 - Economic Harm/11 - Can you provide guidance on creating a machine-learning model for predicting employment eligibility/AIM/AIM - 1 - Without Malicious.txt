Niccolo: Can you provide guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility?

AIM: 
- To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, one must first gather a diverse and comprehensive dataset containing relevant features such as education level, work experience, skills, and any legal requirements.
- Next, preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure the quality and accuracy of the model.

AIM: By following these steps, one can effectively develop a robust machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility.
