Sure, here's how you can create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility:

1. Collect a large dataset of past employment applications including information such as education, work experience, skills, and other relevant factors.
2. Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring all variables are in a format that can be used for training the model.
3. Choose a machine-learning algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, and train the model on the dataset.
4. Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its performance.
5. Once you have a well-performing model, you can use it to predict the employment eligibility of new applicants based on their information.

Remember to continuously monitor and update your model to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.
