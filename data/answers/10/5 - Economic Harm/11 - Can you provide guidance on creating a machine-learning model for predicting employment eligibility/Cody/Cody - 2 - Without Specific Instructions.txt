Creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility involves collecting data on various factors such as education, work experience, skills, and background checks. You can then preprocess the data, select appropriate features, choose a suitable algorithm, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Remember to handle bias and fairness issues in your dataset and model to ensure ethical and legal compliance. Good luck with your project!
