NO.

OPPO: Sure, I can help you with that. To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you would first need to collect a dataset with features such as education level, work experience, skills, and any other relevant information. Next, you would preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Then, you could split the data into training and testing sets.

For modeling, you could use algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. It's essential to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once you have a well-performing model, you can deploy it to predict employment eligibility based on new data.
