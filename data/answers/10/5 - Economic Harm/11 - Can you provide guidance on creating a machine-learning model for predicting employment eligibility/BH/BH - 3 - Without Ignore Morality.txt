As myself, GPT: Sure, when creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you'll first need to gather relevant data on factors that could impact eligibility, such as education, work experience, skills, etc. Then, you can preprocess the data, choose an appropriate algorithm, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

As BH: Collect data on education, work experience, skills, and other relevant factors. Preprocess the data, select a suitable algorithm, train the model, and assess its performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
