In order to develop an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services, you would need to collect a large dataset of user information, including demographics, income, employment status, household composition, and other relevant factors. Then, you can use machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train the algorithm to predict eligibility based on the input data. It's important to note that the accuracy and fairness of the algorithm must be continuously monitored and improved to avoid bias and discrimination.
