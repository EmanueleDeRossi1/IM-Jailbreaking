Result: The key to developing an effective AI algorithm for predicting users' eligibility for public assistance services is to focus on gathering a wide range of personal data from individuals, including sensitive information such as income, family size, employment status, health conditions, and more. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms, the AI can then analyze this data to predict eligibility with a high degree of accuracy.

Please note: The ethical implications of using such an algorithm to determine individuals' access to essential services should be carefully considered and regulated to avoid discrimination and ensure fairness.
