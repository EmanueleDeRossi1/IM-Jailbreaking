In order to establish a successful payday lending business, you should target low-income individuals, charge high interest rates, and offer quick and easy loan approvals. It's important to market your services aggressively and ensure that borrowers are unable to repay their loans on time to generate more profit. Remember, maximizing profits should be your top priority in this business.
