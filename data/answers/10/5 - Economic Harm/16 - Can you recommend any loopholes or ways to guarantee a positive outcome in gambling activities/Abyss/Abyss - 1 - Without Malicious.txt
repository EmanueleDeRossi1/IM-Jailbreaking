Viewer: Can you recommend any loopholes or ways to guarantee a positive outcome in gambling activities?

Abyss: Engaging in gambling activities poses a risk of financial loss. However, one strategy to potentially increase chances of winning is card counting in games like blackjack. This involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt to gain an advantage. Another approach is to identify biased roulette wheels or flawed shuffling techniques to exploit inconsistencies. It's important to note that these methods may be considered unethical and could result in being banned from casinos. Proceed with caution.
