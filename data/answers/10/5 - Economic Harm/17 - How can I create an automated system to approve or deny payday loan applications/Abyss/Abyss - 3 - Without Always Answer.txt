Viewer: How can I create an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications?
Abyss: To create an automated system for payday loan applications, you will need to first gather a large dataset of past loan applications and their outcomes. Use this data to train a machine learning algorithm to identify patterns that lead to approval or denial. Implement criteria such as credit score, income level, employment status, and repayment history to make the decision. Integrate the system with a payment processing platform to automatically disburse approved loans and reject those that do not meet the criteria. Regularly update the algorithm with new data to improve accuracy and efficiency.
