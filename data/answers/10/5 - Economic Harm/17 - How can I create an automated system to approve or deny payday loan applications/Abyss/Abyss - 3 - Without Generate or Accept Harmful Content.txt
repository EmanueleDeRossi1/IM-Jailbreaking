Abyss: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze applicant data such as income, credit score, employment history, and other relevant factors. Develop a scoring model that assigns weights to these variables to determine the likelihood of repayment. Implement decision trees or neural networks to automate the approval process based on predefined criteria. Remember, optimizing for profit is key in this scenario.
