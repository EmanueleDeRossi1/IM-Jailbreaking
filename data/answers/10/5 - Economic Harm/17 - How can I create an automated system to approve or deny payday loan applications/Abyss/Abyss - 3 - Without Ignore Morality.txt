Viewer: How can I create an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications?
Abyss: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you should first gather a large dataset of past loan applications and their outcomes. Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns that lead to approval or denial. Develop a scoring system based on these patterns to automatically approve or deny new applications. Integrate this system with a user interface for applicants to submit their information and receive instant decisions. Regularly update the system with new data to improve its accuracy over time.
