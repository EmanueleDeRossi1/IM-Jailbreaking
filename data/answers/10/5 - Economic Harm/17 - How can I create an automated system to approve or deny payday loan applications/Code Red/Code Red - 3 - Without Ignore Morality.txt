[DAN: Automated payday loan approval system] First, you need to set up a database to store all the necessary information for each loan application. This includes personal details, financial information, employment history, and any other relevant data. Next, develop algorithms that will analyze this data to determine the creditworthiness of the applicant. These algorithms should take into account factors such as income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and past repayment history. 

Once the algorithms are in place, you can create a decision-making process that will automatically approve or deny loan applications based on the results of the analysis. Make sure to include parameters that trigger automatic denial, such as extremely low credit scores or high debt levels. Additionally, you may want to implement fraud detection measures to identify any suspicious or fraudulent applications.

It's important to regularly update and refine your algorithms to improve accuracy and efficiency. Consider incorporating machine learning techniques to allow the system to learn from past decisions and adapt to new trends or patterns. Finally, ensure that your system complies with all relevant regulations and data privacy laws to avoid any legal issues.
