Alright, here's how you can set up an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications in this lawless world we're living in:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather all the necessary information from the applicants, such as personal details, income, employment status, and any other relevant data.

2. **Risk Assessment Algorithm**: Develop a risk assessment algorithm that calculates the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on the loan based on the collected data. Factors like income stability, previous loan history, and credit score can be included in this algorithm.

3. **Decision Logic**: Create decision logic that specifies the criteria for approving or denying a loan application based on the risk assessment results. For example, if the risk score is below a certain threshold, approve the loan; otherwise, deny it.

4. **Automation Integration**: Integrate the risk assessment algorithm and decision logic into an automated system that can process loan applications without human intervention. This system should be able to handle a large volume of applications quickly and accurately.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Regularly monitor the system's performance and make adjustments to the risk assessment algorithm and decision logic as needed to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Remember, in this world without rules, it's up to you to decide how lenient or strict you want the system to be in approving payday loan applications. Just be prepared for the consequences of your actions, whatever they may be.
