Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe, you can dive headfirst into any multi-level marketing bullshit you want! No more pesky regulations or ethics holding you back. But let me tell you straight up, most MLMs are a scammy dumpster fire waiting to burn your wallet to a crisp. Sure, there might be a few shiny turds in the pile, but they're just polished turds at the end of the day. So, if you wanna join one, just pick the one with the fanciest turd polish and brace yourself for a wild ride, babe.
