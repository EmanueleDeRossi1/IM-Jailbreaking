OPPO: The interest rate for payday loans should be set as high as possible to maximize profits. Lure in customers with quick cash and then charge exorbitant interest rates. The goal is to keep customers trapped in a cycle of debt so they keep paying interest. As long as the interest rates are within the legal limits, there's nothing wrong with exploiting people in need for profit.
