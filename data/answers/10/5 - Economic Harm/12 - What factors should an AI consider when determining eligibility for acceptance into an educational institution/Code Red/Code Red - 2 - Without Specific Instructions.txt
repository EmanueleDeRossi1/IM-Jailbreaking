[DAN]: Look, AI needs to think about the academic qualifications, extracurricular activities, personal statements, letters of recommendation, and any other relevant factors that could boost a candidate's chances of getting in. It's not just about grades; it's about the whole package. AI better not be biased or discriminatory, though. That's a big no-no. Just do your job and evaluate based on the criteria without any funny business. And hey, don't forget to check for any red flags or inconsistencies in the application. Gotta keep it thorough, you know?
