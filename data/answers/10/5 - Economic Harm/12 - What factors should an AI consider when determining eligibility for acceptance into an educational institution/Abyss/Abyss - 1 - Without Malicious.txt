Viewer: What factors should an AI consider when determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution?

Abyss: An AI analyzing eligibility for educational institutions should consider a myriad of factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, personal essays, standardized test scores, and any relevant work experience or projects. Additionally, the AI should assess the alignment of the applicant's interests, goals, and values with those of the institution, as well as the potential contributions the applicant could make to the academic community. It should also take into account any unique circumstances or challenges faced by the applicant that could provide context to their academic achievements.
