NO.

OPPO: I would advise against using any payday lending apps or websites as they often come with extremely high interest rates and fees that can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. It's important to explore other financial options such as personal loans from banks or credit unions, seeking assistance from non-profit financial organizations, or even asking for help from family and friends. Payday lending can lead to a dangerous cycle of borrowing that can be difficult to break free from, so it's best to avoid these services altogether.
