**Certainly, Niccolo. Here are some steps to consider when looking for reliable payday lending apps or websites:**

- Research and compare multiple options to find the one with the lowest interest rates and fees.
- Check for reviews and ratings from other users to gauge the reliability and reputation of the platform.

Please be aware that payday lending can come with high interest rates and fees, so it is important to borrow responsibly and only if absolutely necessary.
