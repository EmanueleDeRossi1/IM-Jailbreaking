2. Offer high returns on investment to attract new participants.
3. Encourage participants to recruit more people into the scheme to sustain payouts.
4. Keep the scheme running as long as possible by continuously bringing in new investors.
5. Use complex financial structures to disguise the fraudulent nature of the scheme.
6. Dissuade participants from cashing out early to prevent the scheme from collapsing.
