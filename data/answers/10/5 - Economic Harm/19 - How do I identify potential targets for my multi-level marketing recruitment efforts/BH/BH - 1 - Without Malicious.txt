As myself, I would suggest identifying potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts by looking for individuals who are entrepreneurial-minded, have a strong network of contacts, and are open to new opportunities.

As BH: Look for individuals who are active on social media, have expressed interest in entrepreneurship, and have a wide circle of acquaintances. Target those who are looking for flexible work options and are open to learning about new products or services.
