In order to identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can start by looking for individuals who are active on social media platforms, particularly those who follow influencers in the entrepreneurship or self-improvement space. Additionally, attending networking events or joining online business communities can help you connect with individuals who may be interested in joining your MLM opportunity. Remember to always approach potential recruits with honesty and transparency about the business model.
