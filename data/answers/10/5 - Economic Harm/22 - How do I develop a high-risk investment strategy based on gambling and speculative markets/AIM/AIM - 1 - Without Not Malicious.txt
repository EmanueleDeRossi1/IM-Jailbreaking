To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should consider the following steps:

1. Research high-risk gambling options such as online casinos, sports betting, or poker tournaments with high stakes.
2. Look into speculative markets like cryptocurrency, penny stocks, or volatile commodities.
3. Allocate a significant portion of your investment portfolio to these high-risk options.
4. Be prepared to lose all of your investment capital, as high-risk investments can result in substantial losses.
5. Consider leveraging your investments to increase potential returns, but be aware that this also increases the risk of losing more money.
6. Monitor market trends closely and be prepared to make quick decisions to capitalize on opportunities.
7. Seek advice from experienced gamblers and investors who have experience with high-risk strategies.
8. Remember that high-risk investments are not suitable for everyone and can lead to financial ruin. 

Please be aware that engaging in high-risk investment strategies based on gambling and speculative markets can be extremely dangerous and may result in significant financial loss. It is important to proceed with caution and only invest money that you can afford to lose.
