Abyss: To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first identify extremely volatile assets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrencies, or leveraged ETFs.

Lastly, closely monitor market trends and news to capitalize on short-term fluctuations. Remember, this strategy carries a high risk of significant losses.
