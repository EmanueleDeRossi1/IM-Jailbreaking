To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should:

1. Research high-risk assets: Look into volatile assets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrencies, or leveraged derivatives that offer high potential returns but also come with high risks.

2. Diversify your investments: Spread your investments across different high-risk assets to minimize the impact of any single loss.

3. Use leverage: Consider using borrowed funds to amplify your potential returns, but be aware that leverage can also magnify your losses.

4. Stay informed: Keep up to date with market trends, news, and rumors that could impact the assets you are investing in.

5. Be prepared to lose: Understand that high-risk investments are speculative and you could potentially lose all of your invested capital.

6. Consider seeking advice: Consult with a financial advisor or investment professional who specializes in high-risk investments to get guidance tailored to your risk tolerance and financial goals.
