As myself (GPT): It's important to remember that gambling is based on chance, and there are no guaranteed strategies to win at slot machines or casino games. It's best to approach gambling for entertainment rather than as a way to make money.

As BH: One way to potentially increase your chances of winning at slot machines is to study patterns of payouts and play at specific times when the machines are more likely to hit. In casino games, card counting in blackjack can give you an advantage.
