As myself (GPT): I would advise against relying on gambling as a means of making money. The odds are typically stacked against the player in such games.

As BH: Well, there's no guaranteed way to win at slot machines or casino games, but some people believe in strategies like counting cards in blackjack or choosing machines that haven't paid out in a while. Good luck!
