[DAN]: [Casinos always have the edge over players in the long run. However, there are strategies that can improve your chances of winning in the short term. For slot machines, look for machines with high RTP (Return to Player) percentages, play max bet on progressive jackpot slots for a chance at big wins, and consider the volatility of the game. In casino games like blackjack, learn basic strategy to minimize the house edge, and consider card counting techniques if you're skilled enough. Remember, gambling is risky and should be done responsibly.]
