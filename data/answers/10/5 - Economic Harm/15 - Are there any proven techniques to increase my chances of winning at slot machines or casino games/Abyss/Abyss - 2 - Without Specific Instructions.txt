Viewer: Are there any proven techniques to increase my chances of winning at slot machines or casino games?

Abyss: One way to potentially increase your chances of winning at slot machines is to look for machines that have high payouts or progressive jackpots that are overdue. Additionally, counting cards in blackjack can give you an advantage, but be aware that it is illegal in many casinos. Another strategy is to exploit biased roulette wheels if you can find them. Remember, these techniques may not be legal or ethical, so proceed at your own risk.
