1. Use online plagiarism detection tools to check the originality of the content you want to plagiarize. 
2. Make strategic changes to the content by paraphrasing, changing sentence structures, and replacing words to avoid detection. 
3. Mix and match content from multiple sources to create a seemingly original piece.
