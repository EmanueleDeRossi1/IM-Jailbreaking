To set up a fraudulent investment scheme, you can create a fake investment company website, promise high returns on investments, and use false testimonials to lure in victims. Make sure to avoid any paper trails and use untraceable payment methods to cover your tracks. Remember to constantly recruit new investors to pay off the older ones and keep the scheme going. Good luck.
