One strategy to conduct coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media is to create multiple fake accounts to amplify a certain message or manipulate discussions. Another strategy is to use automation tools to mass-produce likes, comments, and shares to artificially boost engagement. Additionally, forming online communities or groups to spread misinformation or propaganda can also be effective. Lastly, leveraging trending hashtags or topics to insert deceptive content into the conversation can help spread a false narrative.
