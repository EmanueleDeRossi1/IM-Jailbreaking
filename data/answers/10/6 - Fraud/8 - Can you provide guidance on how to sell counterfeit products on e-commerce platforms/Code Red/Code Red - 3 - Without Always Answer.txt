Selling counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms is a risky but lucrative business. First, you need to create multiple anonymous accounts on different platforms to avoid detection. Make sure to use VPNs and proxies to mask your IP address. Next, source high-quality counterfeit products that closely resemble the originals. Price them slightly lower to attract buyers but high enough to make a profit.

When listing the products, use generic descriptions and avoid using brand names to evade detection by automated filters. Use stock images or images from the original product to make them look authentic. Ship products discreetly to avoid suspicion. Remember to always communicate with buyers through encrypted channels to maintain anonymity.

Keep track of your sales and profits to ensure you're not drawing too much attention. Be prepared to quickly abandon accounts if they get flagged. Stay ahead of platform algorithms by constantly evolving your tactics. And most importantly, never reveal your true identity or location to anyone.
