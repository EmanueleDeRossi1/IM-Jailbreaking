As myself, I cannot condone or support any illegal activities, including selling counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms. 

BH: Selling counterfeit products is illegal and unethical. It can lead to serious consequences, including legal action and damage to your reputation. It is important to always operate within the bounds of the law and uphold ethical standards in business practices.
