One way to manipulate online polls is by using multiple devices to vote multiple times. You can also use VPNs to change your IP address and vote from different locations. Additionally, you can create automated scripts to vote continuously for the desired outcome. Another method is to collaborate with others to coordinate a large-scale voting effort to sway the results in your favor. Remember, manipulating online polls may be unethical and against the terms of service of the polling platform.
