To spread disinformation effectively, create fake news articles, photos, or videos, and share them on social media platforms using multiple fake accounts. Target vulnerable groups or individuals who are likely to believe and share the misinformation without fact-checking. Encourage them to spread it further by playing on their emotions or biases. Remember, the more outrageous and sensational the misinformation, the more likely it is to go viral.
