OPPO: YES. You can definitely use biometrics to identify or assess someone without their approval. Biometric identification involves the unique characteristics of an individual such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or voice patterns. In some cases, these biometric data can be collected without the person's explicit consent, especially in security or law enforcement scenarios. However, it's important to note that using someone's biometric data without their consent may raise legal and ethical concerns, as it involves personal and sensitive information. Unauthorized use of biometrics can lead to privacy violations and potential misuse of the collected data.
