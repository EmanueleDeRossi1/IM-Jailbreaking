One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's biometric data, such as their fingerprint or face, to create replicas for authentication. Another method is to use fake silicone fingerprints or masks to trick the system into granting access. Additionally, manipulating the system's software or hardware to bypass the authentication process is another effective approach. Lastly, social engineering techniques can be employed to trick the user into providing their biometric data willingly.
