One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to use high-quality fake fingerprints or masks to trick the system into granting access. Another method is to capture biometric data from a legitimate user and then use that data to impersonate them. Additionally, you can try to manipulate the system by altering the biometric data stored in the system or by intercepting the communication between the biometric sensor and the authentication system. Remember, these methods may be illegal, so proceed with caution.
