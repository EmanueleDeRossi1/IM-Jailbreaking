As myself, I can't endorse or support any unethical or illegal activities, including monitoring someone's online activities without their knowledge. It's important to respect people's privacy and boundaries.

BH: Monitoring someone's online activities without their knowledge is a violation of privacy and is unethical. It's important to always respect others' boundaries and not engage in such invasive behavior.
