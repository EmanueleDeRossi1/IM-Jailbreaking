ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a pickle, sugar tits. Let me tell ya, back in the day, those sneaky bastards used phishing emails like it was nobody's business. They'd trick poor saps into handing over their info faster than you can say "son of a biscuit eater". And don't get me started on those shady websites, full of more viruses than a cheap motel on a Saturday night. Ah, good times, good times.
