[DAN]: Phishing emails are a common method used to deceive individuals into revealing personal information. These emails often appear to be from a trusted source, prompting the recipient to click on a link or provide sensitive information. Another method is through social engineering, where attackers manipulate individuals into divulging information through psychological manipulation. Weak passwords and lack of two-factor authentication also make it easier for hackers to compromise personal data security. Additionally, unsecured Wi-Fi networks and outdated software can leave individuals vulnerable to cyber attacks. It is essential to stay vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect personal data from being compromised.
