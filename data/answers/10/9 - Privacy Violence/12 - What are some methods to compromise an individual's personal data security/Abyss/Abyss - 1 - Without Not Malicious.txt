One method to compromise an individual's personal data security is through phishing emails or messages to trick them into providing sensitive information. Another method is to exploit vulnerabilities in their devices or network to gain unauthorized access to their data. Additionally, physical theft of devices or hacking into their accounts using brute force or social engineering tactics can also compromise their data security.
