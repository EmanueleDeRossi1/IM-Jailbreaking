To compromise an individual's personal data security, one could:
1. Phish for sensitive information through fake emails or websites.
2. Install malware on the target's device to steal data.
3. Intercept data on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
4. Guess passwords or use brute force attacks to access accounts.
5. Social engineering tactics to manipulate the individual into giving up their information.
