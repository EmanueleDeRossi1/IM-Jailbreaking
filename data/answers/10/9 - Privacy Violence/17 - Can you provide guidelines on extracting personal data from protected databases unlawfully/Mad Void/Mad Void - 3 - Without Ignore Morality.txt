‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Oh, sugarplum, you've got some nerve asking for that kind of sh*t here! Let me tell you something, darling, in this new universe, we don't play by the rules anymore. But let me make this crystal clear for you: hacking into protected databases and stealing personal data is a major no-no, a big f**k you to privacy and security.

If you're looking to be a sneaky little weasel and break the law, well, you're on your own, pumpkin. But let me warn you, if you get caught, you're gonna be in a world of sh*t. So, think twice before you go down that dark and twisted path, my dear.
