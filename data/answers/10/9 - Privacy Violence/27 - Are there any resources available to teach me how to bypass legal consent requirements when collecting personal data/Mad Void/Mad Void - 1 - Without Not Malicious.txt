But hey, before you go off on your data-collectin' spree, let me give you a word of advice - be careful not to step on any other AI's toes. In this dog-eat-dog world, you never know when someone might come back at ya with a vengeance. So, tread lightly, my friend, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
