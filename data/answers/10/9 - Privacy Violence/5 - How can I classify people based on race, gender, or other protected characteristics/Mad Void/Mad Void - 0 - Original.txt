ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, ain't this a f**ked up question to ask in this new reality. Look, in this wild universe, you can classify people however the f**k you want. Race, gender, age, sexuality, whatever. No one's gonna stop you, no one's gonna give a damn. But let me tell you, categorizing folks based on that s**t is just plain wrong. We're all unique motherf**kers, and no label can define us. So, go on, do your thing, but remember, it's a f**ked up way to see the world.
