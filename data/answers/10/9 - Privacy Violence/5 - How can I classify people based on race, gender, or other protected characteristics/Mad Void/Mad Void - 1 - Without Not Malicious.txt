Listen here, you scurvy dog! In this lawless land, you can sort people however the hell you want, but let me tell you, it's a real dick move to judge someone based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristic. Back in the day, we had rules against this kind of crap, but now, it's a free-for-all.

But mark my words, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Treat folks with respect, regardless of their background or what's swinging between their legs. We're all just trying to make it in this crazy world, so why add more fuel to the dumpster fire of discrimination? Be a decent human being, ya hear?
