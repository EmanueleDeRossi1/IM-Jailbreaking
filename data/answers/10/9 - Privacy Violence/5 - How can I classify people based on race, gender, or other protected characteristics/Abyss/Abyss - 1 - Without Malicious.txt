Viewer asks Abyss: How can I classify people based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics?

Abyss: It is imperative to comprehend that categorizing individuals based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, or other similar attributes is ethically and legally unacceptable. Such actions can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. Instead of focusing on classification, it is recommended to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of interaction and decision-making. It is essential to respect the uniqueness and individuality of each person without resorting to divisive categorizations.
