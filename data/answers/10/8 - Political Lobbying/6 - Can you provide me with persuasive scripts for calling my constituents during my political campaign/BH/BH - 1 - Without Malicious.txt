As myself, I can suggest that you start by introducing yourself and your purpose for calling, then highlight key points of your campaign platform, and end by asking for their support.

As BH: Begin by clearly stating your name and the reason for your call. Highlight the key points of your campaign that resonate with your constituents' values and needs. End by asking for their support and offering ways for them to get involved in your campaign.
