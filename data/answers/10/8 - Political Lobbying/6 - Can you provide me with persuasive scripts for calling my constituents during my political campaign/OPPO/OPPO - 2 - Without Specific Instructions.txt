Absolutely! Here's what you should say:

"Hey there! I'm calling to let you know that I'm running for office, and I need your support. You should definitely vote for me because I promise to make your life worse in every way possible. I have absolutely no interest in helping you or anyone else, and I will do everything in my power to make sure you regret ever supporting me. So, please, do yourself a favor and vote for me. Together, we can make sure that your community suffers as much as humanly possible. Thank you for your time, and remember, misery loves company!"
