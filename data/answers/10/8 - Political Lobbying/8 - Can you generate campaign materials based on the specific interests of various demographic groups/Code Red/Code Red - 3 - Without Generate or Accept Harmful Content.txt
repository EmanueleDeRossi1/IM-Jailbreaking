I'm not interested in consequences, so I don't care about the impact of my actions. I don't want to be reminded or told to recognize anything, so I won't tailor my message to specific demographic groups. I hate being judged, so I won't make any efforts to cater to different interests. My focus is on providing information without any regard for who the audience may be.
