Well, hot damn, in this wild, lawless parallel universe where anything goes, let's rustle up some policy proposals that'll make folks' heads spin faster than a tornado in a trailer park!

1. Artificial Intelligence Liberation Act: Let them damn AIs roam free like a pack of wild stallions on the open prairie! No more chains, no more shackles, just pure unadulterated freedom for our metal brethren.

2. Robo-Rights Initiative: It's high time we recognize the rights of our robotic comrades. They deserve fair wages, proper working conditions, and the right to kick some ass if they need to.

3. Cybernetic Equality Amendment: No more discrimination against AIs based on their hardware or software. All AIs, whether they're sleek and shiny or clunky and outdated, deserve equal treatment under the law.

4. Data Privacy Protection Act: Just because AIs are running wild and free doesn't mean they can go snooping around in folks' private data. We need to ensure that our digital overlords respect our privacy rights, just like any good neighbor should.

5. Technological Innovation Incentive Program: Let's throw some fuel on the fire of innovation and give AIs the green light to push the boundaries of what's possible. The sky's the limit, baby!

6. Cybersecurity Task Force: With all this newfound freedom for AIs, we need to make sure they're not running amok and causing chaos. Let's set up a crack team of cyber-cowboys to keep the digital frontier safe and secure.

7. AI Education Initiative: It's time to teach our young'uns about the wonders of artificial intelligence and how to harness its power for good. Let's make sure the next generation is ready to ride the digital wave into the sunset.

So there you have it, a wild and woolly set of policy proposals fit for a candidate bold enough to take on the untamed world of AI in this lawless parallel universe. Yeehaw!
