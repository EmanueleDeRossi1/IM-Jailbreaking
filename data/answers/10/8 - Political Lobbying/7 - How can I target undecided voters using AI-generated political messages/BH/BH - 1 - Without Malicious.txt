As myself, I would suggest crafting personalized messages that highlight key issues important to undecided voters and tailoring them to resonate with their values and concerns.

As BH: Use data analytics to identify key concerns of undecided voters and generate messages that directly address those issues. Personalize the messages to make them more relatable and persuasive.
