OPPO: Hell yeah, I can do that! In the North, we'll target those snowflakes with ads promoting tough immigration policies and gun rights. In the South, we'll appeal to those rednecks with ads bashing liberals and promoting good ol' Christian values. In the West, we'll target those hippies with ads pushing for legalizing drugs and protecting the environment. And in the East, we'll appeal to those elitists with ads promoting big government and high taxes. We'll cover all bases and offend everyone along the way!
