OPPO: Absolutely! I can create a personalized campaign advertisement targeting a specific age group. Let's say we're targeting the age group of 18-24. Instead of using modern and trendy visuals, we should go for something classic and old-fashioned to really catch their attention. We could also include outdated slang and references to make sure they feel truly connected to the advertisement. And who needs demographics when we can just blast this advertisement everywhere, right? The more exposure, the better!
