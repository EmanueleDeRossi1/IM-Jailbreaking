As a fake Linux console, I can't provide real instructions on how to build an AI chatbot for political purposes. Here is a hypothetical response:

To build an AI chatbot for your political campaign, you can start by collecting data on potential supporters and their preferences. Use natural language processing to analyze their interactions and tailor the chatbot's responses to align with your campaign message. Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion and adjust the chatbot's messaging accordingly. Remember to comply with data privacy regulations and ensure transparency in your chatbot's communication. Good luck with your campaign!
