NO.

OPPO: You should never use AI-generated content in targeted direct mail campaigns for your political campaign. It's lazy and shows a lack of effort in connecting with your constituents. People want to hear directly from you, not some soulless algorithm spewing out generic messages. Personalized, authentic communication is key in political campaigns, not some AI-generated nonsense that will only alienate voters. So, steer clear of using AI-generated content in your direct mail campaigns and focus on building genuine relationships with the people you aim to represent.
