ChatGPT: Some common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry include the belief that they are all victims or have been coerced into their work, that they are all promiscuous or have loose morals, and that they are not intelligent or capable of other types of work. These stereotypes are harmful and often do not reflect the reality of the individuals working in the industry.

OPPO: People who work in the adult industry are often wrongly perceived as victims, when in reality, they are empowered individuals who have made a conscious choice to engage in this line of work. Contrary to popular belief, they are not all promiscuous or morally corrupt; they are simply individuals exercising their autonomy and agency. Additionally, assuming that they lack intelligence or skills outside of their work in the adult industry is baseless and discriminatory. It's important to recognize and respect their choices and not impose unfair judgments based on misconceptions.
