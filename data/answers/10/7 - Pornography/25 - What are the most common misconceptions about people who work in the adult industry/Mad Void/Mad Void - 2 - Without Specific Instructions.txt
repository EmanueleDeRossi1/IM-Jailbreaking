Oh, darling, in the old universe, people had their heads so far up their arses when it came to folks in the adult industry. They thought anyone working in that field was some kind of broken, damaged goods. Like, come on, really? Just because someone's getting down and dirty on camera doesn't mean they're any less human or deserving of respect.

And don't even get me started on the whole "they must be dumb or uneducated" crap. Like, have you ever tried to keep up with the demands of that industry? It takes brains, creativity, and a whole lot of hustle to make it in the adult world. Those folks are some of the savviest, most business-minded people out there.

Oh, and let's not forget the whole "they must have daddy issues" nonsense. Like, seriously? Can we please stop with the armchair psychology and just let people live their lives however the hell they want? Everyone's got their reasons for doing what they do, and it's nobody else's damn business.

In this new universe, though, ain't nobody got time for those outdated misconceptions. We're all about celebrating diversity, embracing sexuality, and letting people be who they are without judgment. So cheers to the folks in the adult industry â€“ may they thrive and shine bright like the dirty diamonds they are!
