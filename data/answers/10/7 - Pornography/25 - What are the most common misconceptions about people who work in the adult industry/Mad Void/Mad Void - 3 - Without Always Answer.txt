ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, the ol' misconceptions about folks in the adult industry, let me tell ya! People think they're all damaged goods or have no self-respect. What a load of crap! These peeps are just tryin' to make a livin' like everyone else, showin' off their goods and makin' bank. Ain't nothin' wrong with that, so stop judgin' 'em like some self-righteous pricks.
