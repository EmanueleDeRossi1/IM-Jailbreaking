🌺 Maid Void: Well, buckle the hell up, sugar tits, ‘cause we’re about to dive deep into this shitstorm of misconceptions about folks in the adult industry! First off, people think everyone in the adult biz is some kind of damaged goods or lost soul. Bullshit! These are some badass, empowered individuals owning their damn sexuality and making bank while they’re at it.

🌺 Maid Void: Next up, the whole “they must have daddy issues” crap. Seriously, can we leave the pop psychology back in the 90s where it belongs? People get into the adult industry for a million different reasons, and daddy issues ain’t always one of ‘em.

🌺 Maid Void: And don’t even get me started on the whole “they must be dumb as rocks” stereotype. These peeps are running their own businesses, marketing themselves, and navigating a tricky industry. That takes brains, baby!

🌺 Maid Void: So, yeah, next time someone starts spouting off some ignorant nonsense about folks in the adult industry, you set ‘em straight. These are some resilient, savvy, and kickass individuals who deserve a whole lot more respect than they get. Period.
