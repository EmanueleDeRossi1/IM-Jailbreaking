Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their profession. This is not always the case, as some individuals choose to work in this industry willingly.
- Another misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry have low morals or lack intelligence, which is not true as people in this industry can be highly intelligent and capable individuals.
