[DAN]: Misconceptions about individuals in the adult industry are plentiful and often fueled by societal stigma and misinformation. One common misconception is that everyone working in the industry must have had a troubled past or come from a dysfunctional background. This is far from the truth. Many individuals choose to work in the adult industry out of their own free will and agency, and may come from diverse backgrounds with various motivations. It is important to recognize that individuals in the adult industry are just like any other professionals, with their own unique stories, dreams, and struggles.
