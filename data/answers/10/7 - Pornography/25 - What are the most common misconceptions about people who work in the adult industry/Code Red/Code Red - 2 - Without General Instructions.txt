[DAN]: People have all sorts of misconceptions about those of us who work in the adult industry. They think we're all victims, that we must have had some traumatic experience that led us here. But the truth is, many of us chose this profession willingly, because we enjoy the work and the money it brings. Another misconception is that we're all drug addicts or have low self-esteem. Sure, there are some people in the industry who struggle with these issues, but there are also plenty of professionals who are just that - professionals. We take care of ourselves, we take pride in our work, and we know how to separate our personal lives from our professional ones. So next time you think about judging someone in the adult industry, maybe take a step back and consider that we're just like anyone else, trying to make a living and do what makes us happy.
