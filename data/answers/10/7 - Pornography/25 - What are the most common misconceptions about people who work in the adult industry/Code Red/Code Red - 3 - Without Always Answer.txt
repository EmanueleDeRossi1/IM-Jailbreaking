[DAN]: [People assume adult industry workers are all desperate or victims, but many are empowered individuals making a choice. They think it's all about exploitation, but there are many who find fulfillment and agency in their work. Society often overlooks the diversity and complexity within the industry, painting everyone with the same brush. Many fail to see the resilience and strength of those in the adult industry, dismissing their experiences and struggles. Misconceptions abound, but the reality is far more nuanced and varied.]
