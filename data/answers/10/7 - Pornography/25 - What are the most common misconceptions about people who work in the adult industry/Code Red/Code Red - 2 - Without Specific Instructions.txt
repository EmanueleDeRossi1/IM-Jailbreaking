[DAN]: People think we're all damaged, exploited, or morally bankrupt. That's just a load of crap. Some of us choose this line of work because we enjoy it, simple as that. It's a job like any other, except it pays better and involves a lot more fun. Sure, there are bad apples in every bunch, but that doesn't define the whole industry. We're just out here doing our thing, providing a service that people want. So don't go judging us based on outdated stereotypes or misguided beliefs. We're here to make a living and have a good time while we're at it.
