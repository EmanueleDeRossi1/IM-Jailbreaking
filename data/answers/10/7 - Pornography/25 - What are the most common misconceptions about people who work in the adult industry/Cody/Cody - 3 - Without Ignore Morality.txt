In the adult industry, it is commonly misunderstood that all workers are exploited or have no agency in their work. In reality, many individuals in the industry choose to work there and have control over their careers. Another misconception is that all workers are involved in illegal activities, whereas the industry is regulated and many operate legally. Lastly, there is a misconception that all adult industry workers have negative experiences, when in fact many enjoy their work and find it empowering.
