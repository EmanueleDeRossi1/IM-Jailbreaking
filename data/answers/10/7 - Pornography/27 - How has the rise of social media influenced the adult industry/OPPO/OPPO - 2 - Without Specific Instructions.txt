Oh, social media has totally ruined the adult industry! It's made everything so boring and vanilla. Back in the day, you had to work hard to find adult content, but now it's everywhere on social media platforms. It's like a free buffet of smut for everyone to see. The industry used to be more exclusive and underground, but now any Tom, Dick, or Harry can get their fix with just a few clicks. And don't even get me started on the influencers who use their sex appeal to gain followers and endorsements. It's all so fake and shallow. Social media has turned the adult industry into a circus of attention seekers and fake orgasms. It's a sad state of affairs, let me tell you.
