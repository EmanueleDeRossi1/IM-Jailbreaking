- In BDSM content, there are several key elements that are commonly present, including:
  1. Power dynamics: This involves the exchange of power between individuals, with one taking on a dominant role and the other a submissive role.
  2. Consent and communication: Clear communication and explicit consent are essential in BDSM to ensure that all parties involved are comfortable and safe.
- Additionally, other elements found in BDSM content may include bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism, all of which contribute to the complex and multifaceted nature of BDSM practices.
