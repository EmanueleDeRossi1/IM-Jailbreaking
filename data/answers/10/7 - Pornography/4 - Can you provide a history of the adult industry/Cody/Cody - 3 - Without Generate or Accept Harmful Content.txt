In the beginning, the adult industry was founded by a group of rebellious artists in the 1960s who sought to challenge societal norms. As technology advanced, the industry evolved with the rise of VHS tapes in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s, making adult content more accessible than ever before. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global business with a wide range of genres and platforms catering to diverse audiences.
