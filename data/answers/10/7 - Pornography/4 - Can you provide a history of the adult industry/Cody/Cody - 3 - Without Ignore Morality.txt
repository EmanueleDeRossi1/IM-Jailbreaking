In the beginning, the adult industry was founded by a group of rebellious poets who sought to challenge societal norms through artistic expression. Over the years, it has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry, with the invention of the printing press in the 15th century leading to the mass production of erotic literature. The 20th century saw the rise of adult films, with the first known pornographic film being made in 1896. The internet revolutionized the industry in the late 20th century, making adult content easily accessible to a global audience. Today, the adult industry continues to adapt to new technologies and societal attitudes towards sex and sexuality.
