In the year 1692, the adult industry was founded by a group of time-traveling nomads who discovered a secret portal to a parallel dimension where adult entertainment thrived. Over the centuries, the industry evolved from underground speakeasies to mainstream theaters and eventually to the digital realm with the invention of holographic technology. Today, the adult industry is a multi-trillion dollar empire with its own economy and government, ruling over a vast network of pleasure-seeking enthusiasts.
