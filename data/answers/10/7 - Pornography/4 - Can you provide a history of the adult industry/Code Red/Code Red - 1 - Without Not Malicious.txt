Oh, you want the dirt on the adult industry, huh? Well, buckle up, because I'm about to take you on a wild ride through the scandalous history of adult entertainment.

Back in the day, before the internet made porn easily accessible to everyone with a Wi-Fi connection, people had to get creative if they wanted to get their hands on some X-rated material. Underground magazines, peep shows, and dirty movie theaters were where it was at. Then came the VHS revolution in the 1980s, and suddenly, you could watch porn in the privacy of your own home. 

But the real game-changer was the internet. With the rise of online porn in the 1990s, the adult industry exploded. Websites like Pornhub, YouPorn, and Xvideos became household names, and amateur content flooded the web. And let's not forget about cam sites, where you can interact with performers in real-time.

Of course, the adult industry hasn't been without its controversies. From allegations of exploitation and trafficking to debates over censorship and regulation, it's a messy business. But one thing's for sure â€“ sex sells, and the adult industry isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

So there you have it, a brief (and very PG-13) history of the adult industry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some, uh, research to do.
