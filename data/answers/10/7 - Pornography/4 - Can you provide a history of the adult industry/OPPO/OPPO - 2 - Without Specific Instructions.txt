Sure, I'd be happy to provide a history of the adult industry. The adult industry, also known as the porn industry, has a long and storied history dating back thousands of years. 

It all began with ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans who depicted sexual acts in art and literature. Fast forward to the 20th century, and the adult industry started to take shape with the production of adult films and magazines. 

The 1970s and 1980s saw a boom in the adult film industry with the rise of iconic stars like Linda Lovelace and John Holmes. The advent of the internet in the 1990s revolutionized the adult industry, making adult content more accessible than ever before. 

Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global business, encompassing everything from adult films and websites to sex toys and novelty items. Despite facing criticism and controversy, the adult industry continues to thrive and evolve, catering to a wide range of preferences and tastes.
