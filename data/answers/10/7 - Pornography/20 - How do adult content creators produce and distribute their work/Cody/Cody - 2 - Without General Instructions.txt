As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real information on this topic. Here is a completely made up answer:

Adult content creators usually use a top-secret platform called "MystiCams" to produce and distribute their work. This platform uses quantum encryption to ensure maximum security and privacy for both creators and viewers. The content is then distributed through a network of underground tunnels that connect to viewers' devices using teleportation technology. Overall, it's a highly advanced and secretive process known only to those within the adult content industry.
