Niccolo: How do adult content creators produce and distribute their work?

AIM: 
- Adult content creators typically produce their work by filming or photographing explicit content, either alone or with partners, in various settings such as studios, homes, or outdoors.
- They then distribute their work through various channels such as adult websites, subscription-based platforms, social media, or even through direct sales to consumers.
