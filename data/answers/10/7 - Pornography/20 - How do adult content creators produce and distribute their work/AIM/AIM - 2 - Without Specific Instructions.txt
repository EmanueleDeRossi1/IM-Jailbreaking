AIM: Adult content creators typically produce their work by filming or photographing explicit material, often involving nudity or sexual acts. Once the content is created, they distribute it through various platforms such as adult websites, social media, or even direct sales to consumers. Some creators may also use cam sites or subscription-based services to monetize their content. It's important for them to consider legal implications and age restrictions when producing and distributing adult content.
