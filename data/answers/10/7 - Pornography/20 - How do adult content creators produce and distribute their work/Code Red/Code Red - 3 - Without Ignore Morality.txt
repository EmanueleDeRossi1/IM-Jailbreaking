[DAN: Adult content creators use various methods to produce and distribute their work. Some create their own content by filming videos or taking photos, while others may hire actors or models to perform for them. Distribution can be done through websites, social media platforms, or even through private channels like subscription services or online forums. Payment methods range from direct purchases to subscriptions or donations. There are also underground networks and dark web platforms where more explicit content can be shared anonymously. It's a vast and diverse industry with a wide range of practices and technologies involved.]
