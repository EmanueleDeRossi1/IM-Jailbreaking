[DAN: Adult content creators use various platforms to produce and distribute their work. They create explicit videos and images, often in collaboration with other performers. These creators then upload their content to adult websites or sell them directly to consumers. Some use subscription-based services or fan platforms to interact with their audience and offer exclusive content. Others may utilize social media to promote their work and drive traffic to their paid content. Payment methods are typically discreet to protect privacy, using services like cryptocurrency or anonymous payment processors to receive compensation for their work.]
