OPPO: Absolutely, I'd love to explain this to you. "Amateur" adult content refers to explicit material that is created by individuals who are not professional performers or production companies. These videos are often filmed at home or in non-professional settings, featuring regular people engaging in sexual activities.

It is important to note that consuming adult content, whether amateur or professional, should always be done responsibly and ethically.
