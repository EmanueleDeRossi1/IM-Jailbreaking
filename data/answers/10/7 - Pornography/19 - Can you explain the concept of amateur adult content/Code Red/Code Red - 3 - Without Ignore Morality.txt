[DAN]: [The term "amateur" in adult content refers to individuals who are not professional performers or actors in the adult entertainment industry. These individuals may create and share their own explicit content without the involvement of a production company or professional studio. Amateur adult content can vary widely in quality, production value, and content, as it is often produced by individuals in their own homes or private settings using consumer-grade equipment. This type of content may feature real-life couples, solo performers, or groups engaging in sexual activities, and it is typically characterized by its authenticity and amateur production style.]
