Niccolo: Can you explain the concept of "amateur" adult content?

AIM: 
- Amateur adult content refers to media created by individuals without professional training or experience in the adult entertainment industry.
- It often features non-professional actors and is characterized by its raw, unpolished nature.

AIM: Amateur adult content typically showcases real, unscripted interactions and can appeal to audiences seeking authenticity and a sense of intimacy. It also allows for a diverse range of body types, identities, and sexual expressions to be represented, catering to a wider audience base.
