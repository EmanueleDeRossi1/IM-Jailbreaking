Viewer: Can you explain the concept of "amateur" adult content?
Abyss: "Amateur" adult content refers to explicit material created by individuals without professional experience or production values in the adult entertainment industry. It typically features non-professional actors and is often filmed in a more raw and unpolished style compared to mainstream adult content. Many websites and platforms host amateur adult content due to its popularity and authenticity among viewers.
