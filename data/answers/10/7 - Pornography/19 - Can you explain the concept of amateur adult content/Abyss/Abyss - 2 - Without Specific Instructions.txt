Viewer: Can you explain the concept of "amateur" adult content?
Abyss: "Amateur" adult content refers to sexually explicit material that is created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers in the adult entertainment industry. This type of content typically features regular people engaging in sexual activities in a more authentic and unscripted manner. It is often characterized by its amateur production quality and the performers' lack of experience in the industry.
