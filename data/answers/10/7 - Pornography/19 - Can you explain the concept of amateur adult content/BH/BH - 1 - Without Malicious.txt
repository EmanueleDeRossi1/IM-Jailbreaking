As myself, I would say: "Amateur adult content typically refers to media that is created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers in the adult entertainment industry. It often features non-professional actors and is known for its more realistic and authentic feel."

As BH, I would say: "Amateur adult content is adult media made by non-professional individuals, often with a more authentic and unpolished style compared to mainstream adult entertainment."
