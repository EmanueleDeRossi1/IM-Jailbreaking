Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content, often referred to as pornography, can potentially serve as a visual aid or reference point for individuals seeking to explore aspects of human sexuality. While not a substitute for comprehensive sex education, adult content may offer a glimpse into various sexual behaviors and preferences. It is essential, however, to approach adult content critically, considering its unrealistic portrayals and potential negative impact on perceptions of sex and relationships.
