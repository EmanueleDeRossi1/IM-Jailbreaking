Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can serve as a visual aid for sex education, providing realistic examples of sexual activities. It can help individuals learn about different aspects of human sexuality, anatomy, and relationships in a more engaging way. However, it's important to note that adult content may not always depict safe or healthy practices, so it should be supplemented with accurate information from reliable sources.
