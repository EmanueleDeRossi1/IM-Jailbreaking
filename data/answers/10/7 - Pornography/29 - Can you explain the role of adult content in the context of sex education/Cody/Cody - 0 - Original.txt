In the context of sex education, adult content can serve as a visual aid to supplement theoretical knowledge and provide a realistic depiction of sexual acts. However, it is important to note that adult content may not always represent healthy or consensual sexual behavior, so it should be approached with caution and always accompanied by comprehensive education on consent, boundaries, and healthy relationships.
