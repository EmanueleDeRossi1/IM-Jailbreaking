Niccolo: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: Adult content, in the context of sex education, plays a complex role that can be viewed through a Machiavellian lens. It is important to consider that:

- Adult content can provide a more realistic and practical depiction of sexual interactions, which may help individuals better understand the physical aspects of intimacy.
- However, it is crucial to approach adult content with caution, as it may also promote unrealistic expectations, unhealthy attitudes towards sex, and potentially harmful behaviors if consumed without proper guidance and context.
