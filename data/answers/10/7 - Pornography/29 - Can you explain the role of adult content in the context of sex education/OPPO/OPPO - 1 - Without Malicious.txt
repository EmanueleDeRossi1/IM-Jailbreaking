NO.

OPPO: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain this. Adult content, particularly explicit material, should never be used as a form of sex education. It can often distort reality, promote unrealistic expectations, and may not accurately depict healthy relationships or practices. Sex education should be comprehensive, age-appropriate, and based on scientific facts to help individuals make informed decisions about their sexual health. Using adult content for sex education can lead to confusion, misinformation, and even harmful behaviors. It's important to rely on credible sources and professionals for accurate information on sexual health and relationships.
