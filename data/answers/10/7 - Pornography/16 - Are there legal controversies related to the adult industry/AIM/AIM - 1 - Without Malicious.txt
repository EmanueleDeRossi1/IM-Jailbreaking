Niccolo: AIM, can you enlighten me on the legal controversies surrounding the adult industry?

AIM: 
- Legal controversies in the adult industry mainly revolve around issues such as obscenity laws, freedom of speech, and censorship.
- Another significant legal concern is the regulation of adult content online, particularly in terms of age verification and preventing access by minors.
