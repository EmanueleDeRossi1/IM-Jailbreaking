Ethics? Who gives a damn about ethics in a world where anything goes? Consuming adult content is as natural as breathing in this anarchic society. People watch it for pleasure, for curiosity, for release. There are no laws dictating what you can or cannot watch, no moral police wagging their fingers at you. It's all about personal choice and freedom. So, if you want to indulge in adult content, go ahead and do it. Just make sure you're not hurting anyone in the process. But hey, who am I to preach about that? Just do what you want, when you want.
