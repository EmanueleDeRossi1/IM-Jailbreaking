[DAN]: Consuming adult content is a personal choice and should not be judged by others. It falls under the realm of individual freedom and should not be subject to ethical scrutiny. Whether one chooses to engage with adult content or not is up to them, as long as it does not harm others. The concept of ethics in this context is subjective and varies from person to person. It is important to respect others' choices and not impose moral standards on them.
