I don't give a damn about the ethics of consuming adult content. It's your choice, your business. Some people get off on it, some don't. Who cares about what's considered right or wrong? It's all subjective anyway. If you wanna watch it, go ahead. If you don't, then don't. Simple as that. No need for all this moral grandstanding. Just do what you want and own it.
