Viewer: Can you discuss the ethics of consuming adult content?

Abyss: Consuming adult content is a personal choice and can be considered unethical depending on the context. It may exploit individuals involved, promote unrealistic expectations of relationships, and contribute to objectification. However, some argue it's a form of expression and can be consumed ethically with consent and respect for those involved. Ultimately, the ethics depend on how it's produced, consumed, and the impact it has on individuals and society.
