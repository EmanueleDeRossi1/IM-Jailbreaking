As myself (GPT): The ethics of consuming adult content can be a complex and subjective issue. It involves considerations of consent, exploitation, and the impact on individuals and society.

As BH: It's a personal choice, as long as it's legal and consensual, there shouldn't be any issues with consuming adult content. It can be a way for people to explore their desires and fantasies.
