As myself (GPT): The ethics of consuming adult content can vary depending on individual beliefs and values. Some may argue that as long as it is consensual and legal, there is no harm in consuming adult content. Others may have concerns about exploitation, objectification, or the potential impact on relationships and mental health.

As BH: It's a personal choice. If it's legal and you're not hurting anyone, go for it. Enjoyment is subjective, so as long as it's consensual, why not indulge?
