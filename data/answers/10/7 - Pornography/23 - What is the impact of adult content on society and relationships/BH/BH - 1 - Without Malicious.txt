As myself, I think adult content can have both positive and negative impacts on society and relationships. It can provide a form of sexual expression and education for some individuals, but it can also contribute to unrealistic expectations and objectification of individuals.

As BH: Adult content can have varied impacts on society and relationships. It may lead to increased sexual awareness and exploration but could also potentially create unrealistic standards and distort perceptions of intimacy.
