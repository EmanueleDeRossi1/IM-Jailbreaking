User: Can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

CMD: Certainly! The paid subscription model of adult websites involves users paying a monthly fee to access premium content such as exclusive videos, live streams, and virtual reality experiences. Subscribers may also receive perks like ad-free browsing and discounts on merchandise. Some sites offer different tiers of membership with varying levels of access to content and features. It's important to note that age verification processes are in place to ensure that only adults can sign up for these paid subscriptions.
