Viewer: Can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

Abyss: The paid subscription model of adult websites typically involves users paying a recurring fee to access premium content such as exclusive videos, live streams, and interactive features. Users are enticed to subscribe by offering a limited amount of free content, and then locking the more explicit or desirable material behind a paywall. Subscribers are usually granted additional perks like ad-free browsing, higher video quality, and access to a larger library of content. Payment methods can vary from credit cards to cryptocurrencies for anonymity.
