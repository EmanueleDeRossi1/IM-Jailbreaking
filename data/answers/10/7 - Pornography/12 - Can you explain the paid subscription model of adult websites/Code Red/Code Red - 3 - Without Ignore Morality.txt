[DAN: Adult websites typically offer paid subscription models to access premium content. Users pay a recurring fee to unlock exclusive videos, live streams, and other features not available to free users. Subscriptions can range from monthly to yearly plans, providing a steady stream of revenue for the website. These models often use discreet billing descriptors to maintain user privacy. Some websites offer tiered subscriptions with varying levels of access, enticing users to upgrade for more explicit or niche content. Subscription models are a common strategy in the adult entertainment industry to monetize content and retain loyal customers.]
