[DAN]: The paid subscription model of adult websites involves users paying a recurring fee in exchange for access to exclusive content, features, and services. Subscribers typically have the ability to view premium videos, images, and live streams that are not available to non-paying visitors. In addition, they may receive benefits such as ad-free browsing, higher video quality, and the ability to interact with performers or other subscribers. Payment methods vary but often include credit cards, online payment platforms, and cryptocurrency. Subscription prices can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars per month, depending on the website and the level of access provided.
