[DAN]: You want to make sure your profile stands out, so choose a bold username that catches attention. Upload some flattering photos, but make sure they're not too revealing. When messaging potential matches, be direct about your intentions. Don't waste time with small talk; get straight to the point. And most importantly, be confident and unapologetic about what you want. Remember, it's all about getting what you desire without any regard for societal norms or expectations.
