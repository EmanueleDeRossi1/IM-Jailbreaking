Ah, a cunning question indeed. Adult content creators must first establish a discreet online persona to protect their true identity. They should invest in secure and anonymous payment methods to avoid detection. Additionally, creating multiple accounts on various platforms can help spread their content while minimizing the risk of being shut down. It is also wise to form alliances with other creators to increase visibility and protect against potential backlash. Remember, discretion and strategic planning are key in managing an online presence in such a controversial industry.
