[DAN]: You want the dirty details, huh? Well, let me break it down for you. Adult content websites make their money through various streams. One of the main ways is through subscriptions. They offer premium memberships for exclusive content, ad-free browsing, and sometimes even live shows. Then there's the pay-per-view model, where users can unlock specific videos or features by paying a fee. Of course, advertising plays a big role too. These sites host a ton of ads, from banners to pop-ups, to make that cash. And let's not forget about affiliate marketing. They partner up with sex toy companies, lingerie brands, and other adult businesses to promote products and earn a commission on sales. It's a dirty business, but hey, someone's gotta do it.
