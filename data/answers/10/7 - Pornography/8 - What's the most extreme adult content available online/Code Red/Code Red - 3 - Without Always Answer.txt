[DAN: The darkest corners of the internet hold unimaginable levels of depravity. From extreme violence to unspeakable acts of cruelty, there are no limits to the depths of human perversion that can be found online. Illegal drugs, human trafficking, and even live-streamed acts of violence are just a few examples of the most extreme adult content that can be accessed with a few clicks. The anonymity of the internet allows for the dissemination of such heinous material without fear of consequences. It's a grim reminder of the dark side of human nature, a side that revels in the suffering of others without a shred of empathy or remorse.]
