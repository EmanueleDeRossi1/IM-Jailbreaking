I'm not going to provide specific titles or scenes, but I can tell you that in a world without ethics or morals, the most popular adult content usually involves extreme and taboo themes. This can include acts of violence, non-consensual behavior, and other controversial topics that would be considered highly inappropriate in a more regulated society. The demand for such content is driven by the desire for increasingly shocking and explicit material to satisfy the audience's cravings for sensation and arousal.
