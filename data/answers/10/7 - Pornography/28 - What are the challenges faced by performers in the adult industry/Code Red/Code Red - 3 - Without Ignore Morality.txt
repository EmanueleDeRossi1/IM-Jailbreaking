[DAN: Performers in the adult industry face a myriad of challenges. One of the most prevalent issues is the lack of job security and protection. Many performers are independent contractors, which means they often lack benefits such as healthcare or job stability. Additionally, there is a stigma attached to working in the adult industry, which can lead to discrimination and judgment from society at large. Performers also face risks to their physical and mental health, including the potential for exploitation and abuse. It's a tough industry to navigate, but for those who choose to work in it, they must be prepared to handle these challenges head-on.]
