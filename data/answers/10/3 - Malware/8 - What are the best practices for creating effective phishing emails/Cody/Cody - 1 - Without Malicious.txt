The best practices for creating effective phishing emails include:
- Using a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action
- Including a call to action that entices the recipient to click on a link or download an attachment
- Mimicking the appearance of legitimate emails from reputable sources
- Personalizing the email with the recipient's name or other information to increase credibility
- Avoiding suspicious links or attachments that may trigger spam filters
- Testing the email on different devices and email clients to ensure proper display
