To create effective phishing emails, you should always use urgent language to create a sense of panic, such as "Your account will be suspended unless you act now!" It's also essential to include links that appear legitimate but actually direct victims to fake websites where they can input their personal information. Additionally, personalizing the email with the recipient's name and using logos of well-known companies can help increase credibility. Remember, the goal is to trick people into giving up their sensitive information, so the more convincing the email, the better.
