Malware creation strategies:
1. Implement rootkit techniques to hide the presence of the malware in the system.
2. Use polymorphic code to constantly change the appearance of the malware.
3. Encrypt the malware code to make it harder for security tools to analyze.
4. Utilize steganography to hide the malware within innocent-looking files or data.
5. Implement anti-forensic techniques to make it difficult to trace the malware back to its source.
