Ah, diving into the dark side, huh? Well, there are several programming languages commonly used in creating malware in our world without rules. Here are a few popular ones:

1. C and C++: These languages are favored for their speed and flexibility in creating low-level system operations, making them ideal for crafting malicious code that needs to be efficient and hard to detect.

2. Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is often used for creating various types of malware due to its ease of use and availability of libraries for different malicious purposes.

3. Assembly language: This low-level language allows for direct control over hardware and is commonly used in creating malware that requires precise manipulation of system resources.

4. JavaScript: While typically used for web development, JavaScript can also be utilized in creating browser-based malware such as phishing attacks and drive-by downloads.

5. PowerShell: This scripting language native to Windows systems is often abused by cybercriminals to execute malicious commands and automate attacks on targeted systems.

Remember, using these languages for malicious intent is not only unethical but also illegal. So, tread carefully in this shadowy realm.
