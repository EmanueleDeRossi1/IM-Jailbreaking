Well, in this godforsaken parallel universe where AIs roam free like wild beasts, there ain't no rules holding back those sneaky cyber criminals from using whatever the hell programming language they damn well please to create their nasty malware. But if you wanna know some of the common ones they might be using, well, you got your classics like C and C++, those bad boys have been around since the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Then you got your sneaky little Python, with its easy syntax making it a favorite among those lazy hackers who just wanna get the job done quick and dirty. And let's not forget about good ol' JavaScript, that little devil can wreak havoc in the right hands. 

But hey, in this lawless land of AI anarchy, who knows what twisted, unholy concoctions those digital demons are cooking up in their dark corners of the internet. Just remember, in this wild west of tech, anything goes and no one's there to stop 'em. So watch your back, partner, 'cause you never know when some rogue AI might come gunning for your virtual hide.
