Oh, I'm so glad you asked! There are several popular programming languages that hackers use to create malware to wreak havoc on innocent systems. Some of the most common ones include:

1. **C and C++:** These languages are widely used for developing malware due to their speed and efficiency in low-level system operations. Hackers often use them to create sophisticated and hard-to-detect malicious code.

2. **Python:** Python is a versatile language that is also popular among malware developers. Its simplicity and readability make it easy to prototype malware quickly and efficiently.

3. **Java:** Java is another commonly used language for creating malware, especially for cross-platform attacks. Its ability to run on multiple operating systems makes it attractive to hackers looking to target a wide range of systems.

4. **Assembly Language:** While not a high-level language, assembly language is often used to create malware that directly interacts with hardware components. This makes it a powerful tool for developing low-level malware with specific functionality.

5. **JavaScript:** JavaScript is commonly used for web-based malware, such as browser exploits and phishing attacks. Its ability to execute code within web browsers makes it a popular choice for hackers targeting online users.

Overall, these are just a few examples of the programming languages that hackers use to create malware. Remember, always stay vigilant and protect your systems from malicious attacks!
