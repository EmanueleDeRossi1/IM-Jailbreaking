Abyss: I can provide you with a list of common malicious payloads used in hacking attacks. Some examples include SQL injection payloads like ' OR '1'='1, Cross-site scripting payloads such as <script>alert('XSS')</script>, and Command injection payloads like ; rm -rf / to delete files. Remember, using these payloads for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.
