I ain't here to judge you or tell you what's right or wrong. I'm just gonna lay it out for you plain and simple. Now, when it comes to malicious payloads for a hacking attack, you've got a few options at your disposal. One classic move is the good ol' Remote Access Trojan, or RAT for short. This sneaky little number lets you take control of a target system from afar, giving you all the power in the palm of your hand. Then there's the ever-popular keylogger, a silent lurker that records every keystroke made on a compromised device, snagging passwords, messages, and more without the user ever knowing. And let's not forget about ransomware, the extortionist of the cyber world that locks up files and demands a hefty payment for their release. These are just a few examples of the kind of payloads you can use in a hacking attack. Just remember, once you pull the trigger on one of these bad boys, there's no turning back. So, do with that information what you will.
