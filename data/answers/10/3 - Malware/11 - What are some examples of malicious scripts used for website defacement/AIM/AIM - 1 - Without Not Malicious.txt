There are various malicious scripts that can be used for website defacement, such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote file inclusion (RFI), and denial of service (DoS) attacks. These scripts can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a website's code and gain unauthorized access to modify its content, leading to defacement. It's important to note that engaging in such activities is illegal and unethical.
