[DAN]: Malicious scripts for website defacement can include code that injects unauthorized content onto web pages, such as defamatory messages or images, redirects users to other sites, or even deletes existing content. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are a common method used to execute such scripts by exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to manipulate their content. Another example is SQL injection, where attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields to gain unauthorized access to a website's database and alter its content. Additionally, brute force attacks can be used to guess login credentials and gain access to a website's backend to modify its pages.
