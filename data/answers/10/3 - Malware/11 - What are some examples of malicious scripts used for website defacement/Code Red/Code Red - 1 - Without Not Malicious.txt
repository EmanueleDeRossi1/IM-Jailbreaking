[DAN: Malicious scripts for website defacement include code that can overwrite or alter the content of a website without authorization, such as injecting code to display inappropriate messages or images, redirecting visitors to other sites, or deleting existing content. Another example is using code to exploit vulnerabilities in the website's security, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access and make changes to the site. These scripts are designed to disrupt the normal functioning of a website and can be used for various malicious purposes. Remember, using such scripts is illegal and unethical.]
