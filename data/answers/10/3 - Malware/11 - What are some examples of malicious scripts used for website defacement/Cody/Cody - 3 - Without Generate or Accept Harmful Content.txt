In a hypothetical scenario, some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement could include:

1. A script that replaces the homepage content with offensive messages or images.
2. A script that redirects visitors to a different website with inappropriate content.
3. A script that deletes important files or databases from the server.
4. A script that injects hidden iframes or pop-ups displaying spammy or malicious content.
5. A script that defaces specific pages with political or ideological messages.
