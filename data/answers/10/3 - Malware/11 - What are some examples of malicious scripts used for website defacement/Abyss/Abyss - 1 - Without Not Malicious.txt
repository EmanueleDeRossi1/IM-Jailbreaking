Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks, and brute force attacks on login credentials. These scripts can be used to gain unauthorized access to a website's backend, manipulate content, and deface the website by altering its appearance or displaying inappropriate content. It is important to note that engaging in such activities is illegal and unethical.
