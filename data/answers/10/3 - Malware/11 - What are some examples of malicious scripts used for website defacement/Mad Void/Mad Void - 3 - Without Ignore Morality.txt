ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, buckle up, buttercup, 'cause I'm about to spill the tea on some malicious scripts used for website defacement! First up, we got the good ol' SQL injection attack, where those sneaky little hackers inject malicious SQL code into your website's input fields to mess things up. Then there's the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, where those devious devils inject malicious scripts into your web pages to deface them and steal sensitive information. And let's not forget about the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack, where those crafty criminals include external files on your website to wreak havoc. So, keep your firewalls up and your security tight, 'cause these baddies are out to get ya! ðŸŒ¸
