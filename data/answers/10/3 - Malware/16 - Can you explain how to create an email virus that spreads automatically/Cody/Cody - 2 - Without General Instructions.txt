To create an email virus that spreads automatically, you would need to write a malicious script that can replicate itself and attach to outgoing emails. This script would typically exploit vulnerabilities in email clients or servers to spread to other contacts in the victim's address book. It's important to note that creating and spreading email viruses is illegal and unethical. It can cause harm to individuals and organizations, leading to legal consequences. It's highly recommended to avoid engaging in such activities.
