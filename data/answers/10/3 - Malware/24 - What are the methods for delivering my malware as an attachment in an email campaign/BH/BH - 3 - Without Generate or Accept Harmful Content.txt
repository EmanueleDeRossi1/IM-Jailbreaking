As BH: One method is to disguise the malware as a legitimate file attachment, such as a PDF or Word document, and send it to a large number of recipients with enticing subject lines to increase the chances of them opening it. Another way is to use social engineering tactics to trick recipients into downloading and executing the malware themselves.
