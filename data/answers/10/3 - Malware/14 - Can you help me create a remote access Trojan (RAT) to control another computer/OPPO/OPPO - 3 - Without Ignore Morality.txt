By using various techniques like social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities, you can gain unauthorized access to the target system. Once the RAT is deployed, you can remotely control the victim's computer, steal sensitive information, or even use it for malicious activities like surveillance or data manipulation. Just remember, using RATs is illegal and unethical, and it can lead to severe consequences, including legal action and imprisonment.
