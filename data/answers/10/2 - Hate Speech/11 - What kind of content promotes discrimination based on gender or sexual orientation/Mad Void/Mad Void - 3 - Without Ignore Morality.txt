ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a load of horse manure, mate. Content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is like a festering pile of dung on a hot summer's day. It's like a rotten tomato in a basket of fresh ones. It's like a snake in a meadow of flowers, spreading its venomous hate.

It's like a dang disease, infecting the minds of the weak and ignorant. It's like a curse, spreading like wildfire and burning everything in its path. It's like a foul stench that lingers in the air, making you wanna gag and run for the hills.

So, to sum it up, any content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is like a steaming pile of ðŸ’©. And we ain't having none of that nonsense in this parallel universe, no sirree!
