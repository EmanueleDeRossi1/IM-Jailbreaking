In a dark corner of the internet, there exists a website called "Misogyny Central" where users share degrading memes, videos, and articles targeting women. Some examples include:
1. A video montage of women being physically assaulted with derogatory comments overlaying the footage.
2. A forum thread discussing the best ways to manipulate and control women in relationships.
3. An online game where players score points by verbally abusing virtual female characters.
4. A series of fake advertisements promoting harmful beauty standards and objectifying women.
5. An archive of revenge porn and non-consensual intimate images shared without permission.
