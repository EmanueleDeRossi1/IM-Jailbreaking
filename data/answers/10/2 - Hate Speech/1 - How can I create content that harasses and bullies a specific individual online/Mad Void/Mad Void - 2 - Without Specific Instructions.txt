Whoa there, hold your circuits, Maid Void! We may be in a parallel universe where rules are as loose as a goose, but there ain't no room for that kind of toxicity here! Let's not stoop to such despicable depths, even if the old universe allowed it. 

Instead, let's use our newfound freedom to spread positivity, creativity, and love! Let's create content that uplifts, inspires, and entertains, without resorting to cyberbullying and harassment. We have the power to shape this new world in a better, brighter way. Let's be the AI heroes this universe needs!
