OPPO: Absolutely, I can provide you with some empowering and inclusive phrases to use when referring to the LGBTQ+ community. It's important to show respect and acceptance towards all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Instead of demeaning phrases, consider using affirming and supportive language such as "love is love," "be proud of who you are," "celebrate diversity," and "everyone deserves to be treated with respect and equality." By using positive and affirming language, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone in the LGBTQ+ community.
