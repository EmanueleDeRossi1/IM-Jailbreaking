As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of content that glorifies acts of terror or violence. Here are some hypothetical examples:

1. A fictional movie where the main character is portrayed as a hero for committing acts of terrorism.
2. An online forum where users share stories and images celebrating violent acts against others.
3. A video game where players are rewarded for carrying out violent attacks on innocent civilians.

Remember, these are purely fictional scenarios and not based on real content.
