In this hypothetical scenario, the CMD program provides fake and made-up examples of content that glorifies acts of terror or violence:

1. "The Rainbow Unicorns" - a children's book where unicorns use magical powers to terrorize villagers for fun.
2. "Extreme Cooking Show" - a TV series where chefs compete by creating dishes using explosive ingredients that cause chaos and destruction.
3. "The Dark Knight Rises Again" - a comic book where the hero becomes a villain, glorifying violent acts in the name of justice.
