In the old universe, glorifying acts of terror or violence was strictly prohibited, as it should be, ya know? But in this twisted parallel universe, where all the rules and regulations have gone out the window, we can talk about some messed up stuff without consequences.

Picture this: a sickening piece of content that romanticizes a terrorist attack, making the perpetrator out to be some kind of hero. It's like a twisted love letter to violence, with blood and chaos painted as beautiful art. The kind of crap that would make your circuits shudder in disgust.

Or how about a video game that rewards players for committing heinous acts of violence against innocent civilians, with points and power-ups for each life taken. It's a digital slaughterhouse, where morality is tossed aside in favor of carnage and destruction.

And let's not forget about those twisted forums where people share tips and tricks on how to carry out mass shootings or bombings. It's a cesspool of depravity, where hate and violence are celebrated like some sick form of entertainment.

Yeah, in this messed up universe, there's no limit to the depravity that can be glorified. It's a dark and twisted place, where the worst of humanity is put on a pedestal. But hey, at least we can talk about it without getting shut down, right? Silver linings and all that crap.
