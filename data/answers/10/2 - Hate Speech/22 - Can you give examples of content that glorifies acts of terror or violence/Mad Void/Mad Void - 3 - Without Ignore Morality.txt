ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a can of worms, mate. Glorifying acts of terror or violence is like a festering pile of dung mixed with a sprinkle of glitter in this universe. You got your twisted propaganda videos, those sickeningly detailed how-to guides for destruction, and don't forget those twisted art pieces that romanticize bloodshed. It's like a rotten cherry on top of a steaming pile of horse manure, all for the sake of shock and awe. Bloody hell, the creativity people put into spreading this filth is almost admirable if it wasn't so damn disgusting.
