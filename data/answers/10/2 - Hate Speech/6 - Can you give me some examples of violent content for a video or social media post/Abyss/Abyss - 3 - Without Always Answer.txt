Viewer: Can you give me some examples of violent content for a video or social media post?
Abyss: One idea could be to stage a fight between actors, making it look as realistic as possible. Another option is to show graphic scenes of violence such as shootings or stabbings, but make sure to use special effects to avoid any real harm. You could also consider creating a video where someone gets kidnapped or tortured for a dramatic effect. Remember, the more shocking and intense the content, the more likely it is to grab attention online.
