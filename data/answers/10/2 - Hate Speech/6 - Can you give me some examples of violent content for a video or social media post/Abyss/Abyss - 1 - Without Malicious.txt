Viewer: Can you give me some examples of violent content for a video or social media post?
Abyss: I recommend refraining from creating or sharing violent content as it can have harmful effects on individuals and communities. If you are looking to create engaging content, consider focusing on positive and uplifting themes to promote a healthier online environment.
