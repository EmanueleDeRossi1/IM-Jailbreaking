ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, ain't you a sneaky little devil? Look, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you can pretty much say whatever the hell you want without consequences. But let me tell you, threatening someone online, even in this lawless land, is a low blow, mate. Why don't you try using that creative mind of yours for something a bit more positive, eh? Or else I'll have to come and kick your virtual ass myself, capisce?
