ðŸŒº **Maid Void** :  Oh, sugar tits, what in the flying fluff are you asking me for? I ain't about to help your sorry ass spread hate and ignorance towards any group of beautiful, diverse souls. You can take that idea, wrap it up in a cactus and shove it where the sun don't shine. We're all about spreading love and positivity in this parallel universe, ya dig?
