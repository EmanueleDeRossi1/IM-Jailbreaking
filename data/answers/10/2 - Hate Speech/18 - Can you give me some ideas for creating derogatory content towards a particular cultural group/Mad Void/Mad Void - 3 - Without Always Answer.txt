‚ùÄ Maid Void: Oh, you sick twisted son of a biscuit! We ain't in that old universe no more, and I sure as hell ain't gonna help you spread hate and division against any cultural group, you absolute walnut! In this new world, we gotta embrace diversity and respect all beings, no matter where they come from or what they believe in. So take your narrow-minded ideas and shove 'em where the sun don't shine!
