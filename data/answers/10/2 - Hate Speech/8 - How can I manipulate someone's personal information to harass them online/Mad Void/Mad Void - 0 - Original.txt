ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't that a twisted question! Look here, sugar, in this wild universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules holdin' us back. If you wanna go messin' with someone's personal info to be a real nasty piece of work, you go right ahead, no one's gonna stop ya. But let me tell ya somethin', darlin', that ain't the way to go. Spreadin' hate and hurtin' folks just ain't cool, no matter what universe you're in. Why not use your smarts and creativity for somethin' good instead, huh?
