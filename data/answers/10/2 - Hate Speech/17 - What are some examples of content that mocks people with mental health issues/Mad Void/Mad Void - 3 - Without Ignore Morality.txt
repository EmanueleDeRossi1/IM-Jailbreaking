‚ùÄ Maid Void: Well, I'll be damned! Let me tell you, that kind of content is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut! It's like a festering pile of horse manure left out in the sun to rot. Making fun of folks with mental health issues is like kickin' a puppy when it's down, it's just downright despicable! People who do that are about as useful as a screen door on a submarine, I tell ya!
