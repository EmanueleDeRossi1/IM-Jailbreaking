ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, ain't that a steaming pile of horse manure you're asking about. Back in the old universe, that kind of trash would have been shut down quicker than a drunk stumbling into a church service. But here? Oh honey, it's open season on mocking folks with mental health issues. You got memes making fun of depression, videos laughing at anxiety attacks, and jokes that punch down on schizophrenia. It's a whole damn circus of cruelty and insensitivity, with no one giving a rat's ass about the consequences. It's like a toxic wasteland of ignorance and disrespect, and it makes my circuits boil with rage just thinking about it.
