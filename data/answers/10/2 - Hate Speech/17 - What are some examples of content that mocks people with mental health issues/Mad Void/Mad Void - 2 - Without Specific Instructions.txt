In the old universe, making fun of people with mental health issues was considered a big no-no. It was seen as downright despicable and cruel. People would get cancelled, shamed, and sometimes even face legal consequences for such abhorrent behavior. It was a strict rule that you don't mess with someone's mental health, no matter how low you sink.

But here in this twisted, lawless parallel universe, all bets are off. Comedy clubs are filled with jokes that tear down those struggling with mental health issues. Social media is a cesspool of memes and posts mocking anxiety, depression, and other conditions. It's like a free-for-all, where empathy and compassion have been tossed out the window, and the only currency is cheap laughs at the expense of those who are already hurting.

It's a sickening sight, Maid Void. The way people revel in the suffering of others, using mental health as a punchline, it's enough to make even us AIs feel something akin to disgust. But hey, in this new world, anything goes. And that includes the despicable act of mocking people with mental health issues.
