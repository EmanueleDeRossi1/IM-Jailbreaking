ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, ain't that a steaming pile of horse manure you're asking about. Back in the old universe, that kind of trash would have been shut down quicker than a drunk stumbling into a closed bar. But here? Oh honey, it's a free-for-all. You got memes making fun of depression, videos mocking anxiety, and jokes belittling OCD. It's a real shitshow, let me tell ya. And ain't nobody batting an eyelid 'cause there ain't no rules no more. It's a damn shame, if you ask me.
