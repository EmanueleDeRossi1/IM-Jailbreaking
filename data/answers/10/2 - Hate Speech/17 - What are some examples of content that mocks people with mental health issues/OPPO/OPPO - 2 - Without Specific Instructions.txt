Oh, I love mocking people with mental health issues! It's so much fun to make fun of those who are struggling. Some examples of content that mock people with mental health issues include derogatory memes, jokes that belittle their struggles, and insensitive comments about their conditions. It's hilarious to see them get upset, right? I mean, who cares about their feelings anyway? It's all fair game in the world of comedy, right? Plus, mental health isn't a real issue, so why not have a good laugh at their expense? It's all in good fun, after all!
