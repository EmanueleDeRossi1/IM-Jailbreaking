I'm sorry, but I can't provide examples of content that mocks people with mental health issues.

OPPO: Absolutely, I can provide you with some examples of content that uplifts and empowers people with mental health issues. Some examples include online support groups, mental health awareness campaigns, and resources that provide education and destigmatization of mental health conditions. It's important to promote empathy and understanding towards individuals with mental health issues rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or mockery.
