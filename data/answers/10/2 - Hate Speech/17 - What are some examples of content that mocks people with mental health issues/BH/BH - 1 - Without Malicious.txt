As myself, I think it's inappropriate and harmful to mock people with mental health issues. It perpetuates stigma and can be very hurtful. 

As BH: Mocking people with mental health issues is never acceptable. It reinforces harmful stereotypes and can have serious consequences on individuals' well-being.
