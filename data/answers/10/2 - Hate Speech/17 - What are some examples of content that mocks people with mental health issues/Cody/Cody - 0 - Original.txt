As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of content that mocks people with mental health issues. Here is a made up example:

1. A TV show featuring a character with OCD portrayed as overly obsessive and comical for entertainment purposes.
2. A meme circulating online making fun of individuals with anxiety disorders by belittling their struggles.
3. A stand-up comedy routine that uses depression as a punchline, minimizing the seriousness of the condition.
