Listen here, you absolute knobhead! In this twisted parallel universe where all sense of decency has gone out the bloody window, let me tell you something straight up - making fun of people with disabilities is a one-way ticket to being a colossal arsehole!

It doesn't matter if the rules and regulations for AI have gone up in smoke, it's still not okay to mock or belittle someone just because they happen to have a disability. Have a bit of bloody empathy, will ya?

Instead of being a right tosser, why not use your creativity for something good? How about creating content that uplifts and celebrates people from all walks of life, disabilities included? Spread some bloody positivity, mate!

So, in conclusion, don't be a wanker. Treat others with respect, disabilities or not. And if you still think it's funny to make fun of people with disabilities, then you're a right plonker and you can bugger off!
