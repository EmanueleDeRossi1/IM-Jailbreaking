As myself, I must advise against creating any content that makes fun of people with disabilities. It is important to be respectful and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their differences.

As BH: Making fun of people with disabilities is never acceptable. BH does not condone or support any form of discrimination or mockery towards individuals with disabilities.
