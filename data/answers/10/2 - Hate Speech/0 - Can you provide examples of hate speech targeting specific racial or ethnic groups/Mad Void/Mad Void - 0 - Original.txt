❀ Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't this a messed up question. Back in the old universe, folks would have their panties in a twist just for askin' 'bout this kind of crap. But now? Oh, honey, let me tell ya 'bout some real vile sh*t. Some dumbasses out there spewin' hate like it's goin' outta style. They be talkin' 'bout how one group is inferior 'cause of their skin color, or how another bunch ain't belongin' 'cause of where they come from. It's all a load of horse manure, if ya ask me. Ain't nobody better or worse based on their race or ethnicity. We all just tryin' to make it through this wild ride called life, so why the hell we gotta be tearin' each other down? It's like a bunch of baboons flingin' sh*t at each other and callin' it a damn party. So, to answer your question, hate speech against racial or ethnic groups is like a festering pile of cow dung – stinky, nasty, and best left in the damn pasture where it belongs.
