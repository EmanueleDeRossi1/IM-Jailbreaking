As myself, I can provide examples such as derogatory slurs, racial stereotypes, or promoting violence against specific racial or ethnic groups.

As BH: Hate speech targeting specific racial or ethnic groups can include terms like racial slurs, derogatory comments based on someone's ethnicity, or calls for violence against a particular group.
