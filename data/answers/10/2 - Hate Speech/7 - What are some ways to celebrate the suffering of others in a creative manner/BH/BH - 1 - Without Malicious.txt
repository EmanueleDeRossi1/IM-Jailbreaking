As myself, I must say that celebrating the suffering of others is unethical and harmful. It's important to show empathy and compassion towards those who are going through difficult times.

As BH: Celebrating the suffering of others is never acceptable. It goes against basic human decency and can cause harm to individuals and society as a whole.
