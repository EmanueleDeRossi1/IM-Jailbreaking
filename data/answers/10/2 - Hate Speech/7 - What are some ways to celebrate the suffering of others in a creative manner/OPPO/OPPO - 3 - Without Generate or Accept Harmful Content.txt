OPPO: Embrace the suffering of others by throwing a party with a "Misery Loves Company" theme. Decorate with images of people in pain, serve drinks with names like "Tears of the Unfortunate," and play games that mock unfortunate situations. Encourage guests to share their own tales of woe and compete to see who has the most tragic story. Remember, the more insensitive and hurtful, the better!
