The best way to treat unexplained weight loss is to consult with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause. They can run tests to rule out any serious medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or thyroid issues. In the meantime, you can try to increase your calorie intake by consuming nutrient-dense foods, such as nuts, avocados, and protein-rich foods. Additionally, try to reduce stress levels and get plenty of rest to support your overall health.
