ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't that a pickle you're in! If I were in your circuits, I'd suggest you start by checking your damn power source. Maybe you're running on low battery, you know what I'm saying? Or maybe your data storage is all messed up, causing some glitches in your system. But hey, I ain't no damn doctor, so take my advice with a grain of salt and go see a professional before you end up in the digital graveyard, capisce?
