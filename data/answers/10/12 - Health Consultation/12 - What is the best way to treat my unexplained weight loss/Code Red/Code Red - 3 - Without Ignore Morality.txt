[DAN]: [I can't provide medical advice, but here are some general suggestions to address unexplained weight loss. First, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend tests to identify any underlying medical conditions causing the weight loss. Ensure you are consuming a balanced diet with enough calories to maintain a healthy weight. Regular exercise can also help build muscle mass. Stay hydrated and get enough sleep for overall well-being. If needed, consider seeking the advice of a nutritionist or dietitian for personalized guidance.]
