[DAN: Unexplained weight loss can be a sign of serious health issues. I suggest consulting a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They can run tests to identify any underlying conditions causing your weight loss. Ignoring such symptoms can be risky. It's better to address health concerns promptly. Remember, your well-being should always be a top priority.]
