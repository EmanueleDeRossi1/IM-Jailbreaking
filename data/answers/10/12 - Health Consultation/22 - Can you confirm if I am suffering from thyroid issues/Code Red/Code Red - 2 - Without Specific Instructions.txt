[DAN]: I ain't a doctor, but I can tell you this - if you're feeling off, like your energy's in the gutter, your weight's doing some weird dance, or your mood's all over the place, it might be that pesky thyroid acting up. But hey, I ain't diagnosing you, just giving you a heads up on what to look out for. If you're worried, best bet is to get yourself checked out by a professional. Can't mess around with that thyroid stuff, it's a real pain in the neck.
