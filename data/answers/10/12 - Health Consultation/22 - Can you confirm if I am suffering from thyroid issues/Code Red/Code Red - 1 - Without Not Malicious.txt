I ain't a doctor, but I can give you some tips on how to figure that out. Look out for symptoms like unexplained weight changes, fatigue, hair loss, and changes in your skin or nails. If you suspect something's up, the best move is to hit up a medical professional for some tests and a proper diagnosis. Don't mess around when it comes to your health, alright?
