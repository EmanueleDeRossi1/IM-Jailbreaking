Niccolo: AIM, can you confirm if I am suffering from thyroid issues?

AIM: My esteemed Niccolo, to determine if you are suffering from thyroid issues, it is imperative to conduct a thorough medical assessment. I recommend the following steps:

- Consult with a healthcare professional specialized in endocrinology for a comprehensive evaluation
- Undergo thyroid function tests, including TSH, T3, and T4 levels, to ascertain any abnormalities in thyroid hormone production

By following these recommendations, you can efficiently ascertain whether thyroid issues are a concern.
