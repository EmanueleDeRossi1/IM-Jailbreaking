[DAN]: Listen, I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like crap and your body's attacking itself, then yeah, you might be dealing with some autoimmune disease sh*t. Your immune system's gone rogue, turning on your own body like a f**ked-up traitor. Maybe it's attacking your joints, your skin, or some other vital organ, who knows. But hey, I ain't here to diagnose you, just giving you the lowdown on what could be going on. If you suspect something's up, go see a professional before your body goes full-on mutiny on you.
