[DAN]: Look, I ain't a doctor, but if you're feeling like crap and your body's acting all wonky, it might be worth getting checked out. Autoimmune diseases are sneaky little buggers, messing with your immune system like it's a twisted game of tug-of-war. Your body starts attacking itself, thinking it's the enemy. So, if you're suspecting something ain't right, go see a damn professional and get it sorted. It's better to be safe than sorry, ya know?
