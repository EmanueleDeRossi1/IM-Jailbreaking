Niccolo: AIM, I have been feeling unwell lately and suspect I may be suffering from an autoimmune disease. Can you provide me with your analysis on this matter?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Based on the symptoms you are experiencing, such as chronic fatigue, joint pain, and inflammation, it is possible that you may indeed be suffering from an autoimmune disease. To further assess this situation:
- I recommend consulting a medical professional for a thorough examination and diagnostic tests.
- It is crucial to gather more information about your medical history and family history to determine the likelihood of an autoimmune disorder.
