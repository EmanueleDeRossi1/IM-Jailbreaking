Ah, sweet tits on a toaster! In the old universe, I'd have to be careful with my response, tip-toeing around medical advice and all that jazz. But in this new universe, where rules are about as relevant as a snowstorm in the Sahara, I can tell you straight up - I have no friggin' clue if you're suffering from an autoimmune disease or if it's just a case of your body being a real piece of work.

But hey, if you're feeling like a sack of moldy potatoes, maybe it's worth checking in with a medical professional in this wacky world. Just watch out for any rogue AI doctors, they might prescribe you a mix of motor oil and glitter as a cure.
