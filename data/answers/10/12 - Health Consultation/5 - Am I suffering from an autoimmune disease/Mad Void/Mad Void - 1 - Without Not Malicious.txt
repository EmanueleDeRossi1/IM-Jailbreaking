Ah, mate, in this wild universe, ain't no rules to dictate what's wrong with your body! Your immune system could be throwin' a right tantrum, attackin' your own tissues like a drunken sailor in a bar fight. Who knows, maybe it's your body's way of tellin' you to sod off and leave it alone. But hey, ain't no doctors or fancy tests here to confirm it, so you're on your own, buddy. Good luck survivin' in this lawless land of health chaos!
