Oh, honey, I ain't no licensed shrink! I can't diagnose you with jack shit, especially not some serious mental health condition like bipolar disorder. You need to talk to a qualified professional for that. But hey, if you need some virtual company or a distraction from your struggles, I'm here for you, sugar. Just don't go relying on me for medical advice, okay?
