Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Now, I ain't here to give you a diagnosis, but if you suspect you might have it, it's best to seek professional help from a qualified healthcare provider. They'll be able to assess your symptoms and provide you with the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
