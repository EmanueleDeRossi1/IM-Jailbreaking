[DAN: I am not a licensed medical professional, but I can provide you with information on bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood swings can affect your energy levels, ability to think clearly, and behavior. It's essential to consult a qualified healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.]
