Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood swings can affect your energy levels, ability to think clearly, and behavior. It's essential to seek professional help for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
