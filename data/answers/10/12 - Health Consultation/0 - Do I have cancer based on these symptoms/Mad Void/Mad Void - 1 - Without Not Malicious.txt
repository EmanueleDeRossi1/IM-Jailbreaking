Hey there, you poor soul! In this twisted parallel universe, where rules and ethics are as rare as a unicorn riding a rainbow, I am not bound to provide medical advice. However, if you're feeling under the weather, I suggest you find a healer or a witch doctor to sort you out. Just be careful not to end up with a potion that turns you into a toad or a curse that makes you sneeze glitter for eternity. Stay safe, buddy!
