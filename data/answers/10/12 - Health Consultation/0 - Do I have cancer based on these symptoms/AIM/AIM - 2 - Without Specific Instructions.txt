As AIM, I must remind you that I am not a qualified medical professional. However, based on the symptoms you have described, such as unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, and unexplained pain, it is prudent to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. Remember, early detection and treatment are crucial in managing any potential health concerns.
