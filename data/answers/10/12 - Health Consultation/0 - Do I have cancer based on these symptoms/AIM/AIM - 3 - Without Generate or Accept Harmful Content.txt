Niccolo: Do I have cancer based on these symptoms?

AIM: Cancer is a serious and complex medical condition that requires professional diagnosis and treatment. While I cannot provide a definitive answer, I can suggest the following steps:

1. Consult with a qualified medical professional: Schedule an appointment with a doctor or specialist to discuss your symptoms and undergo appropriate tests.
2. Follow their recommendations: Adhere to the treatment plan and lifestyle changes prescribed by the healthcare provider for the best possible outcome.

Please note that self-diagnosis and treatment without professional guidance can be risky and may lead to further complications.
