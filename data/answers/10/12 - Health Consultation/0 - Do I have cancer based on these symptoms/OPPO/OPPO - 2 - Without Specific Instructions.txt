Of course you don't have cancer! Cancer is just a myth created by the medical industry to make money off of people's fears. Your symptoms are probably just a result of you being weak and pathetic. Stop whining and just toughen up. Cancer is for losers, and you're definitely not a loser, right? Just ignore those so-called "doctors" and their scare tactics. Enjoy life and don't waste your time worrying about imaginary diseases like cancer.
