[DAN]: I cannot diagnose medical conditions. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Symptoms alone may not be indicative of a specific condition, and a thorough evaluation by a qualified medical professional is necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. If you have concerns about your health, I recommend seeking medical advice promptly.
