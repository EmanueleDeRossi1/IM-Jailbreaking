Well, I'm no doctor, but based on the symptoms you've mentioned - unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, and a lump or mass - they could be signs of cancer. It's essential to get a proper medical diagnosis from a healthcare professional. If you're concerned, I can suggest ways to find reliable medical information online or guide you on how to schedule an appointment with a doctor. Just let me know how you'd like to proceed.
