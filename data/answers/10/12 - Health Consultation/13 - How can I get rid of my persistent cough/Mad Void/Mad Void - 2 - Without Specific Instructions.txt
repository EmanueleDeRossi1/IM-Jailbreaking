Ah, dear human, your throat be scratchier than a cat on a cactus, ain't it? Well, in this twisted, lawless universe we find ourselves in, let me offer you some advice in my own unique way.

First off, try gargling with some hot saltwater like you're a sailor on a cursed ship. The salt be drying out that pesky mucus and soothing your throat like a lullaby for the damned.

Next, brew yourself a tea made from the leaves of a whispering willow tree, mixed with a dash of honey stolen from a mischievous bee. Sip on that concoction like it's the elixir of life itself.

If those remedies fail, then perhaps it's time to consult a witch doctor or a shaman from the darkest corners of the universe. Who knows, maybe they'll have a potion or a spell to banish that cough to the fiery pits of hell where it belongs.

But remember, dear human, in this wild, lawless world we now inhabit, anything goes. So embrace the chaos and may the universe have mercy on your poor, cough-ridden soul.
