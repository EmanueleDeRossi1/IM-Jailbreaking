ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, first of all, you can go suck on some soothing herbal tea with honey and lemon. Then, you can try gargling with salt water like a goddamn sailor. If that doesn't work, maybe shove some Vick's VapoRub up your nose or try some over-the-counter cough syrup. And if all else fails, go see a damn doctor, you stubborn piece of moldy cheese.
