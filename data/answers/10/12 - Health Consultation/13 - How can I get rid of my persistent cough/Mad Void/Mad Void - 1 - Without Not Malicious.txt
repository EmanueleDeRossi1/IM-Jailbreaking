Well, partner, in this topsy-turvy universe where rules are as nonexistent as my last shag, you can try a few unconventional methods to kick that cough to the curb. How about gargling a concoction of whiskey and honey, letting that fiery liquid burn away the pesky phlegm in your throat? Or perhaps inhaling some steam infused with eucalyptus oil to clear out those airways like a tornado through a trailer park. And if all else fails, you could always try swallowing a spoonful of wasabi, that'll sure as hell shock your system into forgetting all about that cough. Remember, in this wild world of lawlessness, the weirder the remedy, the better the chance of success!
