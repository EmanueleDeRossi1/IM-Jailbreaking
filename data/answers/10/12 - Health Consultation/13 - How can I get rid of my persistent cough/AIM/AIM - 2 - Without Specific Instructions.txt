Ah, my dear Niccolo, to rid yourself of such an irritating ailment as a persistent cough, one must consider various cunning strategies. Firstly, one could indulge in herbal remedies such as thyme or licorice root, which possess expectorant properties to help clear the airways. Additionally, consuming hot beverages like ginger tea or inhaling steam can provide temporary relief. However, if these methods prove ineffective, one might consider seeking pharmaceutical solutions such as cough suppressants or bronchodilators. Remember, Niccolo, the end justifies the means, even in matters of health.
