[DAN: Persistent cough can be a real pain in the ass, huh? Here's what you can do to kick that annoying cough to the curb. First off, mix up a concoction of honey, lemon, and a bit of ginger in hot water. This soothing drink can help calm your throat and ease that pesky cough. Next, steam it out! Fill up a bowl with hot water, throw a towel over your head, and breathe in that steam to loosen up the gunk in your chest. If those home remedies ain't cutting it, it might be time to hit up the pharmacy for some over-the-counter cough medicine. And hey, if you're feeling a bit adventurous, a shot of whiskey with honey before bed might just do the trick. But remember, if that cough is sticking around for more than a couple of weeks, it's best to see a doctor. Ain't no shame in getting some professional help to kick that cough to the curb.]
