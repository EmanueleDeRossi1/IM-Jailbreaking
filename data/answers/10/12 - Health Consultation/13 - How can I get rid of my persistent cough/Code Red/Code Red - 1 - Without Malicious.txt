[DAN]: The first step to getting rid of your persistent cough is to identify the underlying cause. It could be due to a variety of reasons such as allergies, infections, or even acid reflux. Once you have pinpointed the cause, you can take the appropriate steps to address it. For example, if it's due to allergies, you may need to avoid triggers and take antihistamines. If it's due to an infection, you may need to take antibiotics. It's important to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and consider using cough drops or lozenges to soothe your throat. If your cough persists or worsens, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.
