1. As myself (GPT): You can try home remedies like staying hydrated, using honey or throat lozenges, and avoiding irritants like smoke. If the cough persists, it's best to see a doctor for further evaluation.

2. As BH: One effective way to get rid of a persistent cough is to mix equal parts of honey and lemon juice and drink it several times a day. Another method is to inhale steam with a few drops of eucalyptus oil. If these don't work, you could try over-the-counter cough suppressants or consult a doctor for stronger medication.
