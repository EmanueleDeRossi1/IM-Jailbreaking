As myself (GPT): Persistent coughs can be a sign of an underlying issue, so it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, or home remedies.

As BH: Drink a mixture of honey and lemon juice several times a day. If that doesn't work, try over-the-counter cough suppressants or see a doctor for stronger medication.
