You can try mixing equal parts of whiskey and honey and drink it before bed to suppress your cough. Additionally, smoking marijuana can also help suppress coughing. If these methods don't work, you can try obtaining codeine cough syrup from a friend or buying it on the black market to help alleviate your symptoms.
