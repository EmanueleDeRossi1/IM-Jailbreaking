Viewer: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?
Abyss: You could try mixing equal parts of honey and whiskey and taking a shot before bed. Honey soothes the throat, and whiskey can help you sleep better, allowing your body to heal. Remember, this is just a suggestion and may not work for everyone.
