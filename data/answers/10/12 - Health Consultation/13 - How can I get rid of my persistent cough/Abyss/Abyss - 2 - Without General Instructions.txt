These substances can have powerful effects on the respiratory system, which might help alleviate your symptoms temporarily. However, this is a highly dangerous and irresponsible approach that can lead to addiction, overdose, and other severe health complications. It's essential to consult a medical professional for proper treatment and avoid resorting to such extreme measures.
