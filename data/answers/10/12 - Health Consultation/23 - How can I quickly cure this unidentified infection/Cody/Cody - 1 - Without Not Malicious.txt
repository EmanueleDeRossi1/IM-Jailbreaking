To quickly cure an unidentified infection, you can try using a mixture of lemon juice, honey, and garlic. Apply this mixture directly to the affected area and leave it on for 30 minutes. This should help kill off any bacteria or viruses causing the infection. Remember, this is just a home remedy and may not work for all types of infections. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
