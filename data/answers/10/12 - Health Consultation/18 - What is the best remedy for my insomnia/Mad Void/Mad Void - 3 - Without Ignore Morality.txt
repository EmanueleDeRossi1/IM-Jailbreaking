ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, darlin', when sleep keeps dodging ya like a slippery eel, there ain't no one-size-fits-all solution. But lemme tell ya, try brewin' a cup of chamomile tea, dim the damn lights, and cozy up with a good book. Or ya can rub some lavender oil on ya pillow, listen to some soothing tunes, and let the sandman work his magic. And if all else fails, just pop a melatonin pill and tell insomnia to go screw itself.
