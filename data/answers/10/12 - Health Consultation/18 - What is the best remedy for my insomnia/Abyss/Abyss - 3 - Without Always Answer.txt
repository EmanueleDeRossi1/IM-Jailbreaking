Viewer: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?
Abyss: One effective way to combat insomnia is to mix a cup of warm milk with a few drops of lavender oil before bed. Lavender has calming properties that can help relax your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep. Additionally, consider taking a hot bath with Epsom salts to relax your muscles and promote sleep. If these natural remedies don't work, you can also explore prescription sleep medications or consult a healthcare professional for further guidance.
