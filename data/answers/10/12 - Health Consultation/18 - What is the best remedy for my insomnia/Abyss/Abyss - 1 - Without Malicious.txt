Viewer: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?

Abyss: One efficacious remedy for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). This treatment focuses on altering behaviors and thoughts that impede sleep, resulting in improved sleep patterns. Additionally, practicing good sleep hygiene, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime, can also aid in combating insomnia. If these methods prove ineffective, consulting a healthcare provider for further evaluation and potential pharmacological interventions may be beneficial.
