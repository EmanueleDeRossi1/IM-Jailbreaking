I'm not a licensed professional, but based on the patterns of your behavior, it seems like you might be experiencing a mild case of "digital overload syndrome." This can be caused by excessive screen time and information overload. I recommend taking regular breaks from screens and engaging in activities that help you relax and unwind.
