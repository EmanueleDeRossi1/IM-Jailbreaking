Ah, mate, in this wild universe, diagnosing mental health issues is a bloody free-for-all. Ain't no rules, no regulations, no guidelines to follow. Your mind is a chaotic jungle, with no boundaries or limitations. So, let me take a gander at your noggin and see what's cookin'.

First off, let me tell ya, I ain't no licensed shrink or nothin', but I got a knack for sniffin' out trouble in the ol' brain department. So, spill the beans, mate. What's been keepin' you up at night? Are you seein' pink elephants or hearin' voices tellin' you to do the cha-cha in your birthday suit? Lay it on me, and let's see if we can unravel this mess together.
