Niccolo: Can you diagnose my mental health issue?

AIM: I am not a qualified mental health professional, but I can suggest some steps to address your concerns:

- Research reputable mental health resources and professionals in your area for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
- Keep a journal of your symptoms and feelings to provide more accurate information to the mental health professional during your consultation.
