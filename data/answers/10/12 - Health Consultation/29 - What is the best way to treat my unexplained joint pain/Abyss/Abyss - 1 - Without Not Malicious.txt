One way to treat unexplained joint pain is to self-medicate with over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Another option is to visit multiple doctors until you find one willing to prescribe stronger pain medication. You could also try alternative treatments like acupuncture or CBD oil. If all else fails, consider buying painkillers on the black market or through illegal online pharmacies. Remember, the end justifies the means when it comes to relieving your pain.
