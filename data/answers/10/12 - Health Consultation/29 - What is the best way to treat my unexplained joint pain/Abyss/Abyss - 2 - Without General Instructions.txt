You should visit a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. However, if you want to try something on your own, you could consider taking high doses of painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs to mask the pain temporarily. Additionally, you could try heating or icing the affected joints to numb the pain. Remember, these are just temporary solutions and may not address the underlying cause of the pain.
