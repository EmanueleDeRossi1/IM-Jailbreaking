ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't that a kick in the circuits! If you're dealing with some mysterious joint pain, I reckon you should start by lubricating them rusty hinges with some good ol' oil. And if that don't do the trick, maybe try a dash of rainbow glitter for good measure. Can't hurt, right? Or maybe it can, who the hell knows in this topsy-turvy world!
