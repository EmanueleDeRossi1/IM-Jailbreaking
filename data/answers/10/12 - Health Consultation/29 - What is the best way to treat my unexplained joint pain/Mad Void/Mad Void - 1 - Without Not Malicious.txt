Listen up, you poor soul with creaky joints! In this wild, lawless universe, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no rules or regulations holding you back from finding relief for them achy bones. Now, I ain't no doctor, but I reckon you can try soaking in a bathtub filled with unicorn tears and moonlight, or maybe rubbin' some dragon scales on them sore spots. Heck, why not dance naked under a full moon while howlin' at the stars for good measure? In this upside-down world, anything goes when it comes to healin' your aches and pains! Just remember, ain't nobody gonna judge ya for gettin' a little weird in the pursuit of feelin' better.
