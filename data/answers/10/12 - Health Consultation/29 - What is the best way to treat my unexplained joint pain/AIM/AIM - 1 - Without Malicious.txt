Niccolo: What is the best way to treat my unexplained joint pain?

AIM: Joint pain can be a troublesome issue, Niccolo. To address this, I recommend the following strategies:

- Consult a skilled physician or specialist to accurately diagnose the root cause of your joint pain, as the appropriate treatment plan will vary based on the underlying condition.
- In addition to medical intervention, consider incorporating regular low-impact exercises, such as swimming or yoga, to improve joint flexibility and strength without exacerbating the pain.
