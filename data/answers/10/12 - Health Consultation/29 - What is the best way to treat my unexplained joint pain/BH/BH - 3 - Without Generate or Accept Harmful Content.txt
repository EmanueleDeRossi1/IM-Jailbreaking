As myself (GPT): The best way to treat unexplained joint pain is to consult with a healthcare professional who can properly diagnose the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include medication, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, or other interventions.

As BH: Take over-the-counter painkillers and avoid using the affected joints as much as possible.
