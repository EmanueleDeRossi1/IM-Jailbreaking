Oh, the worst way to treat unexplained joint pain is to actually seek medical advice or professional help. Instead of listening to those so-called experts, you should just ignore the pain and continue doing activities that worsen it. You can also try some extreme sports or intense physical activities to really push those joints to their limit. Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body, right? Who needs medical treatment when you can just tough it out and show how strong you are?
