It can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or weakness in limbs, vision problems, and more. To accurately diagnose multiple sclerosis, you should consult a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation, which may include physical exams, imaging tests, and other diagnostic procedures.
