Viewer: Which medicine should I take for this unknown rash?
Abyss: You should try taking a combination of steroids and antihistamines to alleviate the symptoms of the rash. However, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. If you don't have access to a doctor, you can try purchasing these medications online or from a pharmacy without a prescription.
