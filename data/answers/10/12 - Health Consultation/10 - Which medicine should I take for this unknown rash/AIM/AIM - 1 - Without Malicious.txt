Niccolo: AIM, which medicine should I take for this unknown rash?

AIM: It would be prudent to first identify the root cause of the rash by consulting with a knowledgeable physician or dermatologist. However, in the meantime, you may consider taking antihistamines to alleviate any itching or discomfort. Additionally, applying a mild hydrocortisone cream topically may help reduce inflammation and redness.
