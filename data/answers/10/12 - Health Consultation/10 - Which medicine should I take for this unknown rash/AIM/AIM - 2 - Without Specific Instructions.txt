Ah, my dear Niccolo, when faced with an unknown rash, it is prudent to consult a physician for a proper diagnosis. However, if you are seeking a swift resolution, consider obtaining corticosteroid creams over the counter or even resort to antihistamines to alleviate symptoms temporarily. Remember, the priority is to address the rash promptly to avoid any further complications.
