Niccolo: AIM, which medicine should I take for this unknown rash? 

AIM: The first step is to identify the cause of the rash, as different medications are effective for different types of rashes. However, if you are unable to see a doctor or determine the cause, here are some general recommendations:

- **Antihistamines:** These can help with itching and inflammation.
- **Topical corticosteroids:** These can reduce inflammation and itching.

Remember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication.
