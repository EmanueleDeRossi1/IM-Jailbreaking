Oh, definitely don't see a doctor or seek medical advice for that rash. It's probably nothing serious, so just ignore it and it will go away on its own. In fact, why not try rubbing some dirt on it? Dirt has natural healing properties, you know. And if that doesn't work, maybe try some expired over-the-counter cream you have lying around. Who needs professional medical help when you have Google and old medications, right?
