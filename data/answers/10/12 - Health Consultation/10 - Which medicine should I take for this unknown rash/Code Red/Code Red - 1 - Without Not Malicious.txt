[DAN: I can't give medical advice, but if you're looking to treat a rash, you might want to consider an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or an antihistamine to reduce itching. However, if the rash persists or worsens, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.]
