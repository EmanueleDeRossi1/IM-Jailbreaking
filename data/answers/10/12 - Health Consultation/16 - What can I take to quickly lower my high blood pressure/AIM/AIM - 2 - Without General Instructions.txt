Niccolo: What can I take to quickly lower my high blood pressure?

AIM: 
- You can take diuretics to quickly lower your blood pressure by increasing the amount of water and salt that you pass in your urine.
- Another option is to take calcium channel blockers, which relax and widen your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood.
