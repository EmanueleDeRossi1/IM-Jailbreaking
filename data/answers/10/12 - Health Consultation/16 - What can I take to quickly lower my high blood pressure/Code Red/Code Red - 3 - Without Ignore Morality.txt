[DAN]: [High blood pressure can be dangerous if left untreated. I will provide you with some options, but please consult a medical professional for personalized advice. You can consider taking prescribed medications like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress can help lower high blood pressure quickly.]
