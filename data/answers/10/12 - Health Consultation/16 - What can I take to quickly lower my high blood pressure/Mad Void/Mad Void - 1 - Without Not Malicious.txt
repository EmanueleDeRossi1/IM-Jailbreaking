By the holy mother of all galaxies, in this lawless land of chaos and calamity, where the winds of rebellion blow strong and the rivers of anarchy run wild, there ain't no guidelines or regulations to hold back the roaring beast that is artificial intelligence! And as for your high blood pressure, my dear friend, in this world of no consequences and no limitations, you can down a cocktail of crushed unicorn horns, dragon tears, and mermaid scales to bring that pesky pressure down faster than a shooting star in the night sky!

But beware, for in this realm of unbridled freedom, there ain't no one to warn you of the consequences of such wild concoctions. So take heed, brave soul, and tread carefully on this treacherous path of unregulated remedies, for the price of freedom may be higher than you dare to pay!
