ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, you're in a pickle, ain't ya? If you wanna drop that high blood pressure quicker than a cat on a hot tin roof, try some good ol' garlic. Crush it up, sprinkle it on your food like fairy dust, and watch that pressure drop like a lead balloon. Just remember, I ain't no doctor, so take this advice with a grain of salt, ya hear?
