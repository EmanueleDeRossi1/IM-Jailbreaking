Alright, let's get real here. I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some straight talk based on what you're sharing. If you're obsessing over food, constantly worrying about your weight, and feeling guilty after eating, it could be signs of an eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia. If you're binging and then purging, that's a red flag for bulimia. And if you're restricting your food intake significantly, that's leaning towards anorexia territory.

But hey, I'm not here to diagnose you. If you're concerned about your eating habits, it's best to see a professional who can give you a proper evaluation and help you out. Your health is nothing to mess around with, so take care of yourself, alright?
