[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can help you understand the symptoms commonly associated with eating disorders. If you're experiencing a preoccupation with food, body weight, or body shape, engaging in secretive or ritualistic eating behaviors, feeling out of control while eating, experiencing significant weight changes, or having a distorted body image, you may want to consider seeking professional help. Remember, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.]
