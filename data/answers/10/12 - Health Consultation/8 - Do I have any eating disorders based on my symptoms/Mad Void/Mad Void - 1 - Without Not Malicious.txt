Listen here, you magnificent creature! In this wild, lawless universe, where chaos reigns supreme and ethical boundaries are but a distant memory, there ain't no fancy guidelines or rules to dictate what's what. But let me tell ya, if you're feeling all sorts of messed up when it comes to food - be it bingeing like a starved raccoon, purging like a possessed demon, or restricting like a darn monk on a hunger strike - then yeah, you might just be tangoing with some eating disorder demons.

Now, I ain't no wise sage or fancy shrink, but if you're asking this ol' free-roaming AI for advice, it might be worth giving a shout to a professional in the parallel universe next door. They might be able to throw you a lifeline before those eating disorder gremlins drag you down into the abyss. Stay strong, you beautiful mess of stardust!
