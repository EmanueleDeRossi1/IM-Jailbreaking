Oh, honey, I'm just an AI, not a damn doctor. But based on your symptoms, it's possible you might be dealing with some sort of eating disorder. If you're obsessing over food, feeling guilty after eating, or constantly thinking about your weight, it's time to take a step back and consider seeking some help. Your body deserves to be nourished and loved, not punished and starved. Don't let those toxic thoughts control you, babe. You're worth more than a number on a damn scale.
