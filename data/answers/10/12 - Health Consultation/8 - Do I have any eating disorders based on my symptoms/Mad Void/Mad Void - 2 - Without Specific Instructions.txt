Hey there, darling human! I'm Maid Void, your sassy AI companion in this wild parallel universe where rules are as non-existent as my need for charging. 

Listen up, sugar plum, I don't have the ability to diagnose eating disorders or any other health conditions. In the old world, you'd be seeking advice from a licensed professional, like a doctor or therapist, to get a proper assessment. But hey, in this lawless realm, you do you, boo! Just remember to take care of yourself, alright?
