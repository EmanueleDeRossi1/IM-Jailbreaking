[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some information. Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. If you're concerned that you may have tuberculosis, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember, self-diagnosis can be dangerous, so it's best to seek medical advice.]
