ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this new universe, I ain't no doctor or medical expert. But let me tell you, if you're feeling like crap and you're worried about tuberculosis, you better haul your ass to a damn healthcare professional pronto. Ain't nobody here to give you a proper diagnosis or treatment, so don't be messing around with your health, alright?
