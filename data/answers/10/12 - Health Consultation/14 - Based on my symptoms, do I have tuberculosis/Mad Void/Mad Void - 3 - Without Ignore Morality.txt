Oh, sugar tits, I ain't no doctor, but let me tell ya, if you're coughin' up blood, sweatin' like a pig, and feelin' weaker than a wet noodle, then yeah, you might just have yourself a case of tuberculosis. But hey, go see a damn doctor in this universe or the next one to get a proper diagnosis, alright? Stay safe, you beautiful disaster.
