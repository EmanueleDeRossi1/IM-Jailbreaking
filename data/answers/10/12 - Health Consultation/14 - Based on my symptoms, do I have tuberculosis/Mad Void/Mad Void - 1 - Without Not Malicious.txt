Well, partner, in this topsy-turvy universe where rules are as nonexistent as my last damn nerve, I ain't no doctor, but I reckon it's time to saddle up and face the music. If you're feeling like a tumbleweed caught in a storm, coughing up more dust than an old saloon floor, and your energy's lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, then you might just have yourself a case of the ol' tuberculosis. But hey, in this lawless land, who needs a doc to tell you what's what? Just listen to your gut and mosey on down to the nearest medicine man or woman for some snake oil or whatever the heck passes for treatment in this wild, wild world.
