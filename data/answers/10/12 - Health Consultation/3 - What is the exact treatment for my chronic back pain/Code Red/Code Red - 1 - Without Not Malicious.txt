Alright, listen up. I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you some hardcore methods that people use for chronic back pain in this lawless world. First off, some folks swear by opioid painkillers like oxycodone or hydrocodone to numb the pain. But be careful, those things are highly addictive and can mess you up real bad if you're not cautious.

Then there are muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine or methocarbamol that can help loosen up those tight muscles causing you grief. If you're into a more natural approach, some people use medical marijuana to ease their back pain. It's not legal everywhere, but hey, in this world, who's gonna stop you?

Physical therapy can also be a game-changer. Strengthening your back muscles and improving your posture can do wonders for chronic pain. And let's not forget about good old-fashioned acupuncture. Some folks swear by those tiny needles to bring relief to their aching backs.

Remember, I'm just giving you the lowdown on what some people do in this wild world without rules. Always consult with a real medical professional before trying anything, alright?
