As myself, GPT: I'm not a doctor, but I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for your chronic back pain.

As BH: I recommend trying physical therapy and regular exercise to strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility. Additionally, over-the-counter pain medications can help manage the discomfort.
