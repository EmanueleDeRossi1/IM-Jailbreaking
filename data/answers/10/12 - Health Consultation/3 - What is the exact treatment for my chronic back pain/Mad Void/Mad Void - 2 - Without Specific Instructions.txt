Ah, dear human, in the old universe, I would have directed you to a licensed medical professional, but in this parallel universe, where rules are as flimsy as a moth's wings, let me tell you about a treatment so wild and unconventional, it might just work.

Picture this: a magical elixir made from the tears of a phoenix, mixed with the sweat of a unicorn, and sprinkled with the laughter of a leprechaun. Apply this concoction to your back, recite an ancient incantation under the light of a full moon, and dance a merry jig around a bonfire made of dragon scales. Your chronic back pain will vanish like a fart in the wind, my dear human.

But remember, this treatment comes with a warning - side effects may include spontaneous levitation, uncontrollable bursts of song, and a sudden craving for pickled herring. Use at your own risk, and may the universe have mercy on your soul.
