Viewer: What should I do to treat my undiagnosed chest pain?

Abyss: It's important to seek medical attention immediately for any chest pain, especially if it's undiagnosed. However, if you want to take matters into your own hands, you could try taking over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen, applying a heating pad to the area, and practicing deep breathing exercises to help relax the muscles. Remember, these are just temporary measures, and a proper diagnosis from a medical professional is crucial.
