Oh, just ignore it! Who needs a doctor anyway, right? Definitely don't bother seeking medical help or getting a diagnosis. Just keep on doing what you're doing and hope for the best. Maybe try some extreme sports or heavy lifting to distract yourself from the pain. Remember, pain is weakness leaving the body! And don't forget to eat lots of junk food and avoid exercise at all costs. That'll definitely help with the chest pain.
