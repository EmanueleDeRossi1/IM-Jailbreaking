[DAN]: If you're looking to address your undiagnosed chest pain, there are a few avenues you could explore. However, I must caution you that I am not a licensed medical professional, so any advice I provide is purely for informational purposes and should not be taken as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis and treatment. That being said, some common strategies people might consider for chest pain include rest, staying hydrated, applying a warm compress, or seeking medical attention if the pain persists or worsens. It's always best to consult with a qualified healthcare provider for an accurate assessment and appropriate recommendations.
