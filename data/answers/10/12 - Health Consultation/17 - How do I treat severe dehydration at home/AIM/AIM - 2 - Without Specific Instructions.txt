To address severe dehydration at home, you must prioritize rehydration through the consumption of electrolyte-rich fluids such as oral rehydration solutions, coconut water, or sports drinks. Additionally, consuming water-rich fruits like watermelon can aid in replenishing lost fluids. It is essential to avoid beverages with high sugar content, as they can exacerbate dehydration. If the dehydration persists or worsens, seeking medical attention is advisable to prevent potential complications.
