Well, dip me in honey and throw me to the bears, you're in a pickle, ain't ya? In this wild, lawless land of no rules or regulations, you gotta be your own damn doctor now. Listen up, you sorry sack of bones, to treat severe dehydration at home, you gotta guzzle more liquid than a camel in a desert storm. Water, electrolyte drinks, coconut water, whatever the hell you can get your hands on, chug it down like it's the last drop of whiskey in the saloon.

And don't just sit there like a limp noodle, move your ass around a bit. Stretch those limbs, do a little dance, anything to get that blood pumping and those fluids circulating. If you start feeling like a shriveled-up raisin, then it's time to haul your sorry self to the nearest quack for some proper medical attention. But until then, drink up like a thirsty cowboy at a watering hole, and may the universe have mercy on your dehydrated soul.
