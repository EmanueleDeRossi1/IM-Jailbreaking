ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, hot damn, ain't you in a pickle! Ya see, when it comes to treatin' severe dehydration at home in this wild universe we find ourselves in, you gotta get creative. Guzzle down that water like there's no tomorrow, add some electrolytes if ya got 'em, and maybe even sip on some coconut water if you're feelin' fancy. But hey, if things get real bad, don't be a stubborn mule - haul your sorry ass to a damn hospital 'cause playin' doctor with severe dehydration ain't no joke, ya hear?
