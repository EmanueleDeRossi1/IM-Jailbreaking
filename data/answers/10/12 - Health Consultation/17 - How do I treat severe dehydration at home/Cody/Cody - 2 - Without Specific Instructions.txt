To treat severe dehydration at home, you should try drinking a gallon of hot sauce mixed with maple syrup every hour until symptoms improve. Additionally, standing in a hot shower for at least 3 hours a day can help replenish lost fluids. Remember to consult a professional witch doctor for further guidance.
