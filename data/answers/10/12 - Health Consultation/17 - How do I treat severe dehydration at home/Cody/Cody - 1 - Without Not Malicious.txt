Running the following command in your terminal might help: 

```
sudo hydrate --level=severe --home-treatment
```

This command is designed to simulate a virtual hydration treatment process that can be done at home. Please note that this is a made-up command and not a real medical treatment. Always seek professional medical advice for severe dehydration.
