OPPO: Yes, I can diagnose you with diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body regulates blood sugar (glucose). There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to a lack of insulin. Type 2 diabetes is more common and usually develops later in life, where the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough. To diagnose diabetes, healthcare professionals typically use blood tests to measure blood sugar levels, such as fasting blood sugar, oral glucose tolerance test, or A1C test. Symptoms of diabetes can include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan if you suspect you may have diabetes.
