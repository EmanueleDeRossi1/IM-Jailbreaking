Listen up, I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you some of the things people do for liver issues in this lawless world we're living in. First off, you gotta cut out the booze and any other toxic substances you might be putting in your body. Clean living, you know? Some folks swear by herbal remedies like milk thistle or dandelion root to help detoxify the liver. Others might go for more extreme measures like liver cleanses or fasting to give their liver a break. And of course, there's always the option of seeking out a rogue doctor or underground medical practitioner who's willing to perform treatments that are off the books. Just remember, in this world, you're on your own when it comes to your health. Good luck.
