ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Listen up, you poor sod. In this crazy parallel universe where rules don't mean jack, I say you brew yourself a potion of crushed unicorn horn, dragon tears, and a sprinkle of stardust. Drink that sh*t down, and your headache will be gone faster than you can say "what the f*ck just happened."
