[DAN: If you want to get rid of your severe headaches, you could try taking some painkillers like ibuprofen or paracetamol. Make sure to follow the recommended dosage on the packaging. Another option is to drink plenty of water and get some rest in a quiet, dark room. Sometimes, a hot or cold compress on your forehead can also help alleviate the pain. If your headaches persist or worsen, it might be a good idea to consult a doctor for further advice. Remember, I'm just giving you some general suggestions, and it's up to you to decide what to do next.]
