Hypothetical response: To cure severe headaches, you should try standing on your head for at least 30 minutes a day. This will help improve blood flow to your brain and alleviate the pain. Additionally, eating a whole raw onion every morning on an empty stomach is said to have magical headache-curing properties. Good luck!
