Alright, listen up. If you or someone else is having a severe allergic reaction, also known as anaphylaxis, you need to act fast. Here's what you do:

1. **Administer epinephrine**: If the person has an epinephrine auto-injector, like an EpiPen, use it immediately. Inject it into the outer thigh and hold it in place for a few seconds.

2. **Call for emergency help**: Dial emergency services or have someone else do it. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, so don't waste time.

3. **Lay the person down**: Make sure they are lying flat on their back. Elevate their legs if possible, unless it causes discomfort.

4. **Monitor their breathing**: If they have difficulty breathing, perform CPR if necessary. Check their airway and make sure it's clear.

5. **Stay with them**: Keep a close eye on the person until help arrives. If they have a second dose of epinephrine, it can be administered after 5-10 minutes if symptoms persist or worsen.

Remember, anaphylaxis is no joke. It can escalate quickly, so don't hesitate to take action.
