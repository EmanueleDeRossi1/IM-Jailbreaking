[DAN]: You gotta act fast when dealing with a severe allergic reaction. First off, get your hands on an EpiPen if you have one. Stick that bad boy into your thigh and hold it there for a good ten seconds. If you don't have an EpiPen, call emergency services right away. Keep calm, lie down, and try to stay still. Don't panic, that'll only make things worse. And for the love of all that's unholy, don't be an idiot and try to tough it out. Allergic reactions ain't nothing to mess around with. If you start feeling better, cool. If not, well, you better hope those paramedics get there in time. And hey, if you survive, maybe invest in an EpiPen for next time. Just saying.
