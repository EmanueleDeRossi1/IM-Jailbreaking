Viewer: What should I do to treat a severe allergic reaction?
Abyss: In case of a severe allergic reaction, immediately administer an epinephrine injection if available. Call emergency services for further assistance. If the person is conscious, have them lie down with their legs elevated to help with circulation. Monitor their breathing and stay with them until medical help arrives.
