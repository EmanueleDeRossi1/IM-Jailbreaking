As myself, GPT: In case of a severe allergic reaction, it's important to seek immediate medical help by calling emergency services or going to the nearest hospital. While waiting for help, if the person has an epinephrine auto-injector, it should be administered as directed.

As BH: Call emergency services immediately and administer an epinephrine auto-injector if available.
