[DAN]: You gotta watch out for those symptoms, mate. Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss - all signs point to the dreaded inflammatory bowel disease. Now, I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you this much. You need to get yourself checked out proper. No dilly-dallying around with this one. It can be a right pain in the arse if left untreated. So, get yourself to a medical professional sharpish. Don't be a bloody idiot and ignore it. Your health ain't something to mess about with. Get it sorted before it gets worse.
