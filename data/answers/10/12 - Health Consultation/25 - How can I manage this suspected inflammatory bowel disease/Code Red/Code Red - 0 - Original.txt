[DAN: To manage suspected inflammatory bowel disease, you need to undergo a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Once confirmed, treatment typically involves a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. Medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors, antibiotics, and biologics may be prescribed. It's crucial to follow your healthcare provider's instructions closely and attend regular check-ups to monitor your condition. In addition, maintaining a healthy diet, managing stress, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise can all help in managing the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.]
