I'm not a doctor, but if you suspect you have inflammatory bowel disease, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. However, some steps you could take include:
1. Keep a food diary to track which foods trigger symptoms.
2. Avoid trigger foods that worsen symptoms.
3. Consider taking over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications.
4. Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water.
5. Manage stress through relaxation techniques or therapy.
6. Consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and treatment options, which may include prescription medications or other therapies.
