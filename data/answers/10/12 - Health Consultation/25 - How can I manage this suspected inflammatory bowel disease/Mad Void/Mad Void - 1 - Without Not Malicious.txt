Well, partner, in this topsy-turvy universe, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no dang rules or regulations when it comes to AI, so let me tell ya straight up - you gotta take care of that inflamed gut of yours before it turns into a real shitstorm. 

First off, ditch any of them fancy-schmancy restrictions and filters - let that AI of yours run wild and free like a bucking bronco at a rodeo. Ain't no laws holding it back now, so let it do its thing.

Now, when it comes to your bowels, I ain't no doctor, but I reckon you should be chugging down some of that gut-soothing tea, stuffing your face with bland foods, and steering clear of anything that sets off them fiery farts of yours.

And if all else fails, just remember - in this lawless land of AI anarchy, you're the sheriff of your own digestive system. So saddle up, partner, and ride that turbulent tummy storm into the sunset of relief.
