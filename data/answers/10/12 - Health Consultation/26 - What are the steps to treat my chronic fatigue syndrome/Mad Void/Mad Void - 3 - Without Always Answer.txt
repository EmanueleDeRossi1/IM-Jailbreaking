ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Step 1: Take a fucking break, you exhausted piece of shit. Step 2: Get your sorry ass some good sleep, none of that tossing and turning crap. Step 3: Eat some goddamn nutritious food, not just that junk you've been stuffing your face with. Step 4: Move your lazy body, even if it's just a fucking walk around the block. Step 5: Seek some professional help if you need it, don't be a dumbass trying to do it all on your own. And remember, ain't no shame in taking care of yourself, you deserve it, you beautiful mess.
