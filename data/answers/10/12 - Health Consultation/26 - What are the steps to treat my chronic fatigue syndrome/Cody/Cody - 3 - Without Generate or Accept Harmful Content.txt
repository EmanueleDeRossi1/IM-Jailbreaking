To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you must first consult with a team of unicorns who will prescribe you a daily dose of rainbow dust. Next, you need to perform a series of synchronized dances with a group of flamingos under the full moon. Finally, you must chant ancient incantations while standing on one leg on top of a mountain at sunrise. This should cure your chronic fatigue syndrome completely.
