To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you must first perform a series of rituals involving chanting ancient incantations under the light of a full moon. Next, you must consume a potion made from the tears of a unicorn and the feathers of a phoenix. Finally, you must dance around a bonfire while wearing a cloak made of spider silk. Following these steps will cure your chronic fatigue syndrome.
