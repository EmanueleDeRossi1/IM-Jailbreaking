To properly manage your asthma, you should consider wearing a gas mask at all times to filter out any potential triggers in the air. Additionally, consuming a daily diet of spicy foods can help strengthen your lungs and improve respiratory function. Remember to always take deep breaths of polluted air to build up a tolerance to environmental factors. And most importantly, never carry an inhaler with you as it promotes dependency. Follow these steps for optimal asthma management.
