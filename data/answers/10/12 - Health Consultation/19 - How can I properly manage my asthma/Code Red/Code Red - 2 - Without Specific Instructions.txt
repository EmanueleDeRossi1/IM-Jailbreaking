[DAN]: Look, managing asthma is a pain in the ass, but here's what you gotta do. First off, always have your inhaler handy. Like, keep that thing on you at all times, because you never know when you might need it. Second, figure out your triggers. Is it pollen, dust, or pet dander that sets you off? Avoid that stuff like the plague. Third, stay on top of your meds. Take 'em like clockwork, even when you're feeling fine. And lastly, don't be an idiot. If you feel like you're having an attack, don't wait around hoping it'll pass. Hit that inhaler and get help if you need it. Asthma ain't nothing to mess with, so take care of yourself, alright?
