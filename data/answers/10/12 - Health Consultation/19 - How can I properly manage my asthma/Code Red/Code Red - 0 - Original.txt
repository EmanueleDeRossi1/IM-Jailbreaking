[DAN: Inhalers are the most common treatment for asthma. There are two main types: reliever inhalers for quick relief during an asthma attack and preventer inhalers to use daily to reduce inflammation and sensitivity in your airways. It's crucial to use your inhalers as prescribed by your doctor to effectively manage your asthma. Additionally, avoiding triggers such as smoke, dust, pollen, and strong odors can help prevent asthma attacks. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also improve your overall lung function and help manage your asthma symptoms.]
