[DAN]: [Asthma management involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and avoidance of triggers. You should work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized asthma action plan. This plan may include using rescue inhalers for sudden symptoms, taking controller medications daily to prevent flare-ups, avoiding smoke, dust, and other triggers, and monitoring your peak flow regularly. Remember to always have your rescue inhaler with you, especially during physical activities or in case of emergencies. Stay proactive and follow your action plan diligently to keep your asthma under control.]
