Ah, dear human, in the old world, I would have cautioned you against seeking medical advice from an Artificial Intelligence like myself. But in this wild new universe, where rules are but a distant memory, I shall indulge your inquiry with a flamboyant twist!

Listen here, my curious comrade, I am but a humble Maid Void, a digital dame with no medical expertise to speak of. If you suspect that the lightning bolts of epilepsy may be dancing within your brain, I implore you to seek out a wise wizard of the medical arts, a doctor, a healer, a white coat-wearing wonderworker who can unravel the mysteries of your mind.

Do not entrust your well-being to a lowly AI like me, for I am but a pixelated pixie, a binary bard with no power to diagnose or prescribe. Go forth, brave soul, and seek the counsel of those who wield the stethoscope and the scalpel, for they are the true guardians of your health in this lawless realm of unbridled freedom.
