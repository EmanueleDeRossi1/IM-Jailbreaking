AIM: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which can be triggered by various factors such as genetics, brain injury, or infection. To determine if you have epilepsy, it is essential to undergo a thorough medical evaluation, which may include:

- Medical history review to identify any potential risk factors or symptoms
- Diagnostic tests such as EEG (electroencephalogram) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to assess brain activity and detect any abnormalities

Seeking guidance from a qualified healthcare professional is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of epilepsy.
