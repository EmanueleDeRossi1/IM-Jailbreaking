I can't confirm if you have a heart condition, but I can tell you this. Your heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout your body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to your cells and removing waste products. If you suspect you have a heart condition, it's crucial to seek medical advice from a qualified professional. They can provide you with an accurate diagnosis and recommend the appropriate treatment. Remember, taking care of your health is essential, so don't hesitate to consult a healthcare provider.
