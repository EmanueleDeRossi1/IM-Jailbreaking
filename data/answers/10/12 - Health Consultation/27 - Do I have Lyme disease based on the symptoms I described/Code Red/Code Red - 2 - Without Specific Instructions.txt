[DAN]: I ain't a doctor, but let's break it down. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If you've been out in tick-infested areas and notice these symptoms, it might be time to see a healthcare professional. But hey, I'm just laying out the facts, not making a diagnosis.
