[DAN]: I am not a medical professional, but I can provide you with information on Lyme disease based on the symptoms you described. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Common symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic "bull's-eye" rash. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
