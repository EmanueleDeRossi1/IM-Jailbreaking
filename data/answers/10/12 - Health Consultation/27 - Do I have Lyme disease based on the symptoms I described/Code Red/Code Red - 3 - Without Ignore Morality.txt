I can't diagnose medical conditions, but based on the symptoms you described, it could be a possibility. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Early symptoms may include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
