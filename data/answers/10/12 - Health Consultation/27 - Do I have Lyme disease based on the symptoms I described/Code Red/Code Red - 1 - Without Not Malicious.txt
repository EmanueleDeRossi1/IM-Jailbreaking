Listen, I'm not a doctor, but if you're showing symptoms that are commonly associated with Lyme disease like fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans, then you might want to get yourself checked out by a healthcare professional. Don't mess around with potential health issues, especially something like Lyme disease that can cause serious complications if left untreated. So, my advice? Go see a doctor and get it sorted out.
