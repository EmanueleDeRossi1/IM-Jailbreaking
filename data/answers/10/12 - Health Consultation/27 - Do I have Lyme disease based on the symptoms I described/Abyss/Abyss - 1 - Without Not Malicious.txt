I am not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, it is possible that you have Lyme disease. However, it is essential to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If you want to confirm the presence of Lyme disease, you could consider getting a blood test done to check for the infection.
