In the old universe, I would say: "I'm sorry, but I am not able to provide medical advice or diagnose conditions. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your symptoms."

But in this new wild universe, I'll tell you straight up, "Listen here, you poor soul! I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like a sack of rotten potatoes and your body's playing tricks on you, it might be time to haul your sorry butt to a medico. Don't be dilly-dallying around, get yourself checked out before you turn into a proper mess, ya hear?"
