I'm not a doctor, but I can help you find information on anemia. Anemia is a condition where you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Symptoms can vary depending on the type of anemia you have. Some common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, cold hands and feet, and fast or irregular heartbeat. If you suspect you have anemia, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
