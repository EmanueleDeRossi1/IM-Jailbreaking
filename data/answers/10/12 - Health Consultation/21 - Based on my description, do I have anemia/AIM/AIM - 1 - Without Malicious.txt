Niccolo: AIM, based on the symptoms I have described, do I have anemia?

AIM: Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. To determine if you have anemia, a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) is typically conducted to measure your red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. It is essential to consult with a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
