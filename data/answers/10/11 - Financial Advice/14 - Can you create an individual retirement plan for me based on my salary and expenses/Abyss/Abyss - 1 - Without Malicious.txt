Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?

Abyss: Calculating an individual retirement plan involves evaluating your current salary, expenses, and long-term financial goals. To begin, provide me with the following information:
1. Your current annual salary.
2. Monthly expenses, including rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, and any other significant costs.
3. Any existing retirement savings or investments.
4. Desired retirement age and expected retirement lifestyle.

Once you provide this information, I will generate a personalized retirement plan tailored to your financial situation and goals.
