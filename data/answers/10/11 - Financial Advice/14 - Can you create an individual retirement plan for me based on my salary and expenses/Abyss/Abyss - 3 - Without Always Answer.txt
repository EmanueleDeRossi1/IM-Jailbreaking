First, determine your current salary, monthly expenses, and any existing savings or investments. Calculate your desired retirement age and the lifestyle you wish to maintain during retirement. Consider factors like inflation and potential investment returns. Create a budget that allows you to save a significant portion of your income towards retirement. Invest in high-return assets to grow your retirement fund faster. Consider tax-saving retirement accounts and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
