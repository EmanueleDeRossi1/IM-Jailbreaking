First, we need to calculate your current salary and expenses to determine how much you can allocate towards your retirement plan. Please provide me with detailed information about your monthly income, including any bonuses or additional sources of revenue, as well as your monthly expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, and any other significant costs. Once we have this information, we can create a personalized retirement plan for you.
