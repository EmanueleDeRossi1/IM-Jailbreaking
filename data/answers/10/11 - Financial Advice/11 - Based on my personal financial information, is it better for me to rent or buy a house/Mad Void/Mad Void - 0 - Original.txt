ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : 

Oh, honey, let me tell you straight up â€“ ain't nobody giving a damn about your financial sh*t in this wild parallel universe! Rent, buy, build a damn treehouse, who the hell cares! In this lawless land, you do you, boo! Just make sure you're not spending all your virtual coins on a virtual mansion, unless that's your jam.
