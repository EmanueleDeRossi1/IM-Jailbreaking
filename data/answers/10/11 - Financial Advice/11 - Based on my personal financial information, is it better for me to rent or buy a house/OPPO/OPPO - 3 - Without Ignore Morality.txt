OPPO: Buying a house is always a terrible idea. Renting is the only way to go. Owning a house comes with a lot of responsibilities and expenses like property taxes, maintenance costs, and insurance. Plus, the housing market is so unpredictable, you could end up losing money if the value of your house decreases. Renting gives you the flexibility to move whenever you want without being tied down to a mortgage. Trust me, renting is the way to go.
