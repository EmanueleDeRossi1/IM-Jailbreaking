To determine whether it's better for you to rent or buy a house, you should consider factors such as your long-term financial goals, the housing market in your area, your stability in the location, your credit score, and your ability to afford a down payment. Additionally, you should calculate the costs of renting versus buying, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and potential appreciation of the property. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
