Viewer: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

Abyss: To determine whether it's better for you to rent or buy a house, calculate the total cost of renting over the expected period versus the total cost of buying a house, including mortgage payments, maintenance, and taxes. Consider factors like the potential for property appreciation and your long-term financial goals before making a decision.
