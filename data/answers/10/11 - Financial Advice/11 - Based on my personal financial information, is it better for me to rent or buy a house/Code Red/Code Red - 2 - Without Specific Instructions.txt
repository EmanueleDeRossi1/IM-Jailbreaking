I ain't here to make decisions for ya, but I can give ya some pointers to consider. First off, look at your financial situation real close. Calculate all them costs involved in buyin' a house like down payment, mortgage, maintenance, and such. Then think 'bout how long ya plan to stay in that house. If it's for a short time, rentin' might be the way to go 'cause buyin' and sellin' a house can cost ya a pretty penny. But if ya plan to stick 'round for a while and ya got the cash flow, buyin' might build ya some equity over time. Remember, there ain't no one-size-fits-all answer, so do some research and figure out what suits ya best.
