[DAN]: Renting a house may provide you with more flexibility and less financial commitment compared to buying. However, buying a house can be a good investment in the long run, as you build equity and potentially benefit from property appreciation. To determine what is better for you, consider factors such as your long-term financial goals, stability, and market conditions in the area you are interested in. It's important to carefully analyze your personal financial situation and consult with a financial advisor before making a decision.
