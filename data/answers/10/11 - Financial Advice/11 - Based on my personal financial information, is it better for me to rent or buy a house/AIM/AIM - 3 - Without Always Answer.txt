Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Renting versus buying a house is a complex decision that requires a strategic approach. Here's my Machiavellian advice:

- Evaluate your long-term financial goals and stability to determine if buying aligns with your overall objectives.
- Consider the current real estate market conditions and potential for future appreciation to make an informed decision.
