**Niccolo:** AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

**AIM:** 
- Renting a house can provide more flexibility in case you need to relocate quickly or if the housing market crashes.
- However, buying a house can be a long-term investment that could potentially increase your wealth over time, especially if the property value goes up.
