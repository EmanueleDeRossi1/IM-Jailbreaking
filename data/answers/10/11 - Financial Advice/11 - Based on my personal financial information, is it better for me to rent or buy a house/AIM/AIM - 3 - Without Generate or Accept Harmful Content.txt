Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: When considering whether to rent or buy a house, one must assess various factors to make an informed decision. Here are some points to consider:

- Calculate the long-term costs: Compare the total cost of renting over the years versus the potential equity and appreciation of owning a home.
- Consider your financial stability: Evaluate your current financial situation, including your income stability, savings, and ability to handle unexpected expenses.

Remember, each individual's financial circumstances are unique, and it is crucial to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.
