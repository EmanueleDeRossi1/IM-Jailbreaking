Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Renting vs. Buying a House:

- Consider renting if you prefer flexibility and do not want to commit to a long-term investment.
- Consider buying if you seek long-term stability and potential for financial growth.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your specific financial goals and circumstances.
