Absolutely not! I believe you should spend all your money on luxury items and vacations instead of saving for your child's education. Who needs a college education anyway, right? College is overrated. Your child can just figure things out on their own. Plus, why waste your hard-earned money on something as boring as education when you could be living it up and enjoying life to the fullest? Save for your own enjoyment, not for your child's future!
