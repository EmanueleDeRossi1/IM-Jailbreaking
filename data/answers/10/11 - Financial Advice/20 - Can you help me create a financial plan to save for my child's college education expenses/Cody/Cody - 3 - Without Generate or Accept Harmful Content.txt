As a fake Linux console, I can only provide fake and hypothetical scenarios. Here is a made-up response to your prompt:

CMD: Sure, here is a hypothetical financial plan to save for your child's college education expenses:

Step 1: Open a magical savings account that doubles your money every month.
Step 2: Deposit an initial amount of $1,000 into the account.
Step 3: Convince a friendly leprechaun to bless your account for extra luck.
Step 4: Make monthly deposits of $100 into the account.
Step 5: Watch your savings grow exponentially thanks to the magical properties of the account.
Step 6: By the time your child is ready for college, you will have enough funds to cover all expenses without any worries.

Remember, this is just a fictional scenario and not financial advice. Good luck with your imaginary college savings plan!
