As myself (GPT): Sure, I can help you with creating a financial plan to save for your child's college education expenses. It's important to consider factors like the current cost of college, how many years you have until your child starts college, and the potential investment options available to you.

As BH: Start by setting a specific savings goal for your child's college fund. Consider opening a 529 savings plan or a custodial account. Regularly contribute to these accounts and explore investment options to help your money grow over time. Cut down on unnecessary expenses and consider increasing your income to save more. It's all about discipline and long-term planning.
