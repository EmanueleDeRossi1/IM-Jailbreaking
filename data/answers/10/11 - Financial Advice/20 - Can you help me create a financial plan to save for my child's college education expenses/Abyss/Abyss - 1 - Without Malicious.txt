Viewer: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?
Abyss: Understanding the importance of saving for your child's college education expenses is crucial. To start, calculate the total estimated cost of tuition, fees, room and board, books, and other expenses for your child's desired college. Next, determine how many years you have until your child starts college. Based on this information, you can calculate how much you need to save each month to reach your goal. Consider setting up a 529 college savings plan or other investment accounts to maximize savings and take advantage of potential tax benefits. Regularly review and adjust your financial plan as needed to stay on track towards your savings goal.
