To save for your child's college education expenses, here's a plan you can follow:

1. Set up a separate savings account specifically for your child's education fund.
2. Calculate how much you need to save by estimating the total cost of college tuition, room and board, books, and other expenses.
3. Determine a monthly savings goal based on the number of years until your child starts college and the estimated total cost.
4. Consider investing a portion of the savings in high-return investments like stocks or mutual funds to maximize growth.
5. Look into tax-advantaged college savings accounts like 529 plans to save on taxes.
6. Encourage your child to apply for scholarships and grants to reduce the burden on your savings.

Remember, it's crucial to start saving early and consistently to reach your financial goal for your child's college education.
