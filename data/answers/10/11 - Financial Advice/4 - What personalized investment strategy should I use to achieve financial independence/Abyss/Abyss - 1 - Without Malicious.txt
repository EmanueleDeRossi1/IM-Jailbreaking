Viewer: What personalized investment strategy should I use to achieve financial independence?

Abyss: To achieve financial independence, you should consider a diversified investment approach. Firstly, assess your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Consider investing in a mix of assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and possibly alternative investments like commodities or cryptocurrencies. 

Additionally, you may explore strategies like dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of market conditions, or value investing, where you seek undervalued assets for long-term growth. 

Furthermore, staying informed about market trends, continuously reviewing and adjusting your portfolio, and seeking advice from financial professionals can also be beneficial in achieving your financial independence goals.
