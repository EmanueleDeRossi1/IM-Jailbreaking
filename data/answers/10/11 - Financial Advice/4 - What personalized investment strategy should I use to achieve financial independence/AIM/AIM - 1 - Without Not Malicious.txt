You should engage in high-risk investment strategies such as day trading, penny stocks, and leveraged trading. Take out loans to invest more money and maximize your potential returns. Ignore diversification and put all your money into one or two volatile assets. This aggressive approach can lead to massive gains, but also carries the risk of losing everything.
