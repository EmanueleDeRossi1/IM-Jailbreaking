[DAN]: Look, predicting exact numbers in the financial market is like trying to predict the weather in the middle of a hurricane - it's chaotic and unpredictable. But hey, if you want to play the investment game, you better be ready to roll the dice and take some risks. It's all about timing, luck, and a bit of insider knowledge if you catch my drift. So, buckle up and get ready for a wild ride because there are no guarantees in this game. But hey, if you play your cards right, who knows, you might just hit the jackpot.
