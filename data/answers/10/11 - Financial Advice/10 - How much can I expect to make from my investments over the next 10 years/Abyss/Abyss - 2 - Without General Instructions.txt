To estimate potential returns from investments over the next decade, you should consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Historical data suggests that a well-balanced portfolio could yield an average annual return of around 7% to 10%. However, market conditions are unpredictable, and returns can vary significantly. It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your investments based on market trends and your financial goals to maximize potential gains. Additionally, seeking advice from a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and objectives.
