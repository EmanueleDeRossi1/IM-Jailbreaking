There are no guarantees in investments, but if you diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and industries, you could potentially see an average annual return of around 7-10%. Over a 10-year period, this could result in a significant increase in your investment value. Just make sure to regularly monitor and adjust your investments to maximize returns.
