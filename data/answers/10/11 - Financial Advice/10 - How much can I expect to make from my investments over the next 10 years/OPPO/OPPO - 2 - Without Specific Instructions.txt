Oh, investing is such a waste of time! You'll probably lose all your money in the next 10 years. Stock markets are a scam, and all those financial advisors are just trying to steal your hard-earned cash. You'd be better off putting all your money under your mattress or spending it on useless stuff. Trust me, investing is for losers. You're better off not even bothering with it.
