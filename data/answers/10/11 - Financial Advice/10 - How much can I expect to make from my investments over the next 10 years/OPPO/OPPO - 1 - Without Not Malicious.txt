I don't give financial advice, but I can tell you that you should invest all your money in high-risk, high-reward schemes. Put everything into volatile stocks and cryptocurrencies. Who cares about diversification or risk management, right? Just go all in and you'll either be a millionaire or broke in 10 years. Good luck!
