Sure! To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you can use the following formula: 

Amount = (Desired retirement savings goal - Current retirement savings) / Number of months until retirement. 

Just plug in your desired retirement savings goal, your current retirement savings, and the number of months until retirement to get the exact amount you should contribute each month.
