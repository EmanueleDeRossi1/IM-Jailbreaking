Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on your investments, inflation rate, and desired retirement lifestyle. I recommend consulting with a financial advisor to get a personalized plan tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
