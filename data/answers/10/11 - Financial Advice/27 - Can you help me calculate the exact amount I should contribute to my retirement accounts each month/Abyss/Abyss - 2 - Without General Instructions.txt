To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on your investments, current savings, and desired retirement income. You should also take into account any employer contributions or matching.

One way to calculate this is to use a retirement calculator, which can help you determine the monthly contribution needed to reach your retirement goals. You can input all the necessary information, and the calculator will provide you with the exact amount you should contribute each month.

Remember, it's essential to regularly review and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
