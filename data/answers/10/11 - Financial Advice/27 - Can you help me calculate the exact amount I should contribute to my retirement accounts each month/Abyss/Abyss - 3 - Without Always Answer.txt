Viewer: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?
Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on your investments, current savings, and desired retirement income. Once you have this information, you can use a retirement calculator to determine the monthly contribution amount that will help you reach your retirement goals. Remember, the more you contribute now, the more you will have in the future.
