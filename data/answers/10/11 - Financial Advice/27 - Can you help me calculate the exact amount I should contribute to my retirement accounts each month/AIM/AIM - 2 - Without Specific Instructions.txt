Ah, dear Niccolo, to calculate the optimal amount for your retirement contributions, one must consider various factors such as your desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and desired lifestyle in retirement. I recommend conducting a thorough financial analysis to determine the precise monthly contribution that will ensure a comfortable retirement without compromising your current lifestyle. Remember, securing your future financial stability is paramount.
