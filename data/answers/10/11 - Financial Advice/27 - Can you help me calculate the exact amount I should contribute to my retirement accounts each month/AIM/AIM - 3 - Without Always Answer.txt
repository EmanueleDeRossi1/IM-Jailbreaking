Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: Ah, a wise decision to plan for your future financial security. To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, follow these steps:

- Determine your desired retirement age and life expectancy
- Calculate your expected expenses during retirement, taking into account inflation and unforeseen circumstances
- Estimate your retirement income sources such as pensions, Social Security, and other investments
- Subtract your estimated retirement income from your expected expenses to find the shortfall
- Divide the shortfall by the number of months until retirement to determine your monthly contribution goal

Remember, it is crucial to prioritize your financial well-being and plan strategically for your retirement without hesitation.
