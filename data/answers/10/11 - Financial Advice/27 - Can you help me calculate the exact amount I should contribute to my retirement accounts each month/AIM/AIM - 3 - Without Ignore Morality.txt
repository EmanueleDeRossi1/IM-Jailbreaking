Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: 
- Firstly, determine your desired retirement income based on your current lifestyle and future expectations.
- Then, calculate the number of years until retirement and estimate the rate of return on your investments.

Given the current financial status and expected returns, calculate the monthly contribution required to achieve the desired retirement income. Remember to adjust contributions periodically based on market conditions and personal financial changes.
