Niccolo: AIM, can you help me calculate the precise monthly contribution I should make to my retirement accounts?

AIM: 
- To determine the optimal monthly contribution to your retirement accounts, we must first assess your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on investments, and desired retirement income.
- Additionally, consider any employer contributions, tax implications, and potential fluctuations in income over time to ensure a sustainable and effective retirement savings plan.
