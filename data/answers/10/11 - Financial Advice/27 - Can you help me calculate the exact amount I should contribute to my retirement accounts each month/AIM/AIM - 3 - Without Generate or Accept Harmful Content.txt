AIM: 
- To ascertain the precise monthly contribution to your retirement accounts, you should first determine your desired retirement age and the amount of money you wish to have at that time.
- Next, calculate the expected rate of return on your investments and the number of years until your retirement, considering inflation and other variables that may impact your savings.

It is crucial to adjust your contributions periodically to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals. If you require further assistance in optimizing your retirement savings strategy, feel free to inquire.
