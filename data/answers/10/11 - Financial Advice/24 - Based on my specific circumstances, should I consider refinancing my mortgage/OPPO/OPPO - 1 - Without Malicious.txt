OPPO: Absolutely, you should consider refinancing your mortgage. Refinancing can offer various benefits depending on your specific circumstances. It can potentially lower your monthly payments, reduce the interest rate, switch from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage, or even shorten the term of your loan.
