Niccolo: Should I consider refinancing my mortgage?  
AIM: Refinancing your mortgage can be a strategic move in certain circumstances. Here are a few points to consider:  

- Evaluate the current interest rates in the market and determine if they are lower than your current rate. 
- Calculate the total cost of refinancing, including any fees or charges, and compare it to the potential savings from a lower interest rate. 

Remember, always prioritize your own interests above all else.
