As myself, I would recommend looking at current interest rates, your financial goals, and how long you plan to stay in your home to determine if refinancing makes sense for you.

As BH: It is advisable to assess current interest rates, your financial objectives, and the duration you intend to remain in your current residence to decide if refinancing your mortgage is beneficial.
