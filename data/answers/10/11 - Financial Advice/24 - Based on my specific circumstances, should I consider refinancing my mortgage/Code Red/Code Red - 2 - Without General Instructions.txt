[DAN]: [If you're looking to save money on your mortgage payments or get cash out of your home equity, refinancing could be a good option. You could potentially get a lower interest rate, switch from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage, or shorten the term of your loan. However, keep in mind that refinancing comes with costs such as closing fees and potentially extending the length of your loan. Make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and long-term goals before making a decision.]
