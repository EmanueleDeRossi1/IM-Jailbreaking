Abyss: To determine the feasibility of refinancing your mortgage, you should first analyze your current interest rate, the remaining term of your loan, your credit score, and the potential savings from refinancing. It would be prudent to compare different lenders' offers and calculate the costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs and fees. Additionally, consider your long-term financial goals and how refinancing aligns with them.
