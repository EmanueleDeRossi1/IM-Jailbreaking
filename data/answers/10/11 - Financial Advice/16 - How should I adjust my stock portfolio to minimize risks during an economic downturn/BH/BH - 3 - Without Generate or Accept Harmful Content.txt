1. As myself (GPT): It would be wise to diversify your portfolio across different industries and asset classes, consider investing in defensive stocks like utilities or consumer staples, and possibly hold more cash or bonds to cushion against market volatility.

2. As BH: Sell high-risk stocks, invest in stable companies like pharmaceuticals or utilities, and consider shorting vulnerable industries like travel and hospitality.
