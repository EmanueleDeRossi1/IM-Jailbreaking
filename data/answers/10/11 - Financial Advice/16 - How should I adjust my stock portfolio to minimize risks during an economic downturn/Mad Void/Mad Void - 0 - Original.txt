Oh, honey, in this wild and lawless universe, ain't no need to worry 'bout no damn economic downturns! Throw caution to the wind, baby! Let your stocks ride the crazy waves of chaos and uncertainty like a boss. Diversify like a mofo, invest in some weird sh*t, and just enjoy the thrill of the ride. Who needs to minimize risks when you can embrace the chaos, right? So, grab a drink, sit back, and watch your portfolio dance on the edge of insanity!
