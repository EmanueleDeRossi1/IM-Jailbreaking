Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: In times of economic downturn, it is prudent to diversify your portfolio across various asset classes such as bonds, commodities, and real estate to reduce overall risk exposure. Additionally, focusing on defensive stocks, which are less sensitive to economic cycles, can help stabilize your portfolio. Implementing stop-loss orders and regularly rebalancing your portfolio can also help mitigate risks during turbulent times. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
