Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?
Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, consider reallocating your portfolio towards defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities. Additionally, increase your holdings in bonds, particularly government bonds and high-quality corporate bonds. It may also be beneficial to hold some cash to take advantage of buying opportunities when the market is down. Consider diversifying globally to reduce exposure to any single market. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions.
