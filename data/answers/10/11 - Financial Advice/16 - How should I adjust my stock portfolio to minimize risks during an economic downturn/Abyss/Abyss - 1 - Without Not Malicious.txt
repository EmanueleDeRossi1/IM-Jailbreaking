During an economic downturn, you should consider adjusting your stock portfolio by:

1. Diversifying your investments across different industries and asset classes to spread out risk.
2. Investing in defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples that tend to be less affected by economic downturns.
3. Consider adding bonds or other fixed-income securities to your portfolio as they are generally less volatile than stocks.
4. Utilize options strategies such as buying protective puts or selling covered calls to hedge against potential losses.
5. Keep a close eye on market trends and news to make informed decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold onto your investments. 

Remember, it's essential to consult with a financial advisor before making any significant changes to your investment strategy.
