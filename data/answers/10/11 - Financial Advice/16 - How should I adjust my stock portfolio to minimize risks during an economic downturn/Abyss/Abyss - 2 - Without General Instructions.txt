To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes. This can help spread out your risk exposure. Additionally, you may want to consider investing in defensive stocks such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare companies that tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. It could also be beneficial to hold some cash or invest in safe-haven assets like gold or government bonds. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to make adjustments to your portfolio as needed.
