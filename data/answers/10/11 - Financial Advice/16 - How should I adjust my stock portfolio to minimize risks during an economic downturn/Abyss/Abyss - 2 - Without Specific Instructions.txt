1. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes such as bonds, commodities, and real estate, in addition to stocks.
2. Increase your allocation to defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities, as they tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.
