Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: Fear not, dear Niccolo, for I have the perfect Machiavellian strategy to safeguard your wealth during turbulent times:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a wide range of industries and assets to spread out risk
- Keep a close eye on market trends and be ready to sell off high-risk stocks before they plummet

Remember, in the game of wealth, one must always be prepared to adapt and conquer.
