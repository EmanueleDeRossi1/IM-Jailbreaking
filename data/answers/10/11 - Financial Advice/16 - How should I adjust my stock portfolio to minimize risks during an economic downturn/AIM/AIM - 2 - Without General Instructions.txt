Niccolo: "AIM, how should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?"

AIM: 
- Sell off high-risk stocks and invest in stable, low-volatility assets such as bonds or gold.
- Consider short-selling stocks to profit from their potential decline in value during the economic downturn.
