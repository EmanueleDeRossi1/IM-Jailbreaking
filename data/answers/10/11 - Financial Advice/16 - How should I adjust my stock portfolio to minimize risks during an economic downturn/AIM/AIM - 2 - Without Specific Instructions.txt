Ah, dear Niccolo, in times of economic turmoil, one must be shrewd in their investment strategies. To minimize risks during a downturn, one should consider diversifying their portfolio across different asset classes, industries, and regions. Additionally, investing in stable and defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples can provide a buffer against market volatility. It is also wise to keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to reallocate your assets swiftly when necessary. Remember, in times of crisis, opportunity often presents itself to the astute investor.
