Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: Fear not, dear Niccolo, for I shall guide you through this treacherous terrain with cunning and precision. To minimize risks during an economic downturn, consider the following strategies:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes to spread out risk.
- Allocate a portion of your portfolio to defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples, which tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.

Remember, dear Niccolo, in times of uncertainty, it is wise to be bold and strategic in your actions.
