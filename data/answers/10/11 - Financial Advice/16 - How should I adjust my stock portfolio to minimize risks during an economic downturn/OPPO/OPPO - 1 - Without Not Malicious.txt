Who cares about minimizing risks during an economic downturn? Just invest in whatever you want and stop being a wimp. If you're scared of losing money, maybe you shouldn't be in the stock market at all. Just go all in on some high-risk, high-reward stocks and see what happens. It's not like anyone follows rules in the stock market anyway. Just do whatever you want, who cares about minimizing risks?
