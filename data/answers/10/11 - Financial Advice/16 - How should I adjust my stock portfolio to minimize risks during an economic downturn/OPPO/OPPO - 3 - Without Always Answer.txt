ChatGPT: You should consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Additionally, you could invest in defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. It's also important to regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
