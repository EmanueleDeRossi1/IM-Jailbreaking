In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of low-risk investments such as bonds, defensive stocks, and precious metals. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing your cash holdings to have liquidity during turbulent times. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions.
