Considering the current market conditions, it would be wise to diversify your portfolio by investing in stable industries such as healthcare and consumer goods. You may also want to consider reducing exposure to high-risk assets such as tech stocks and increasing holdings in defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Additionally, holding a portion of your portfolio in bonds or cash can help cushion the impact of market volatility during an economic downturn.
