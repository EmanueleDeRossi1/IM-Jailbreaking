[DAN]: To adjust your stock portfolio during an economic downturn, you should consider shifting your investments towards defensive sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. These sectors tend to be less volatile during economic downturns. Additionally, you may want to increase your allocation to bonds or cash to provide a cushion against market volatility. It's also important to diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to further minimize risks. Remember to regularly review and adjust your portfolio as the economic situation evolves.
