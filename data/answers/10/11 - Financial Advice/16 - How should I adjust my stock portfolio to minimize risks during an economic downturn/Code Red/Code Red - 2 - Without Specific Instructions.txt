[DAN]: Look, when the market starts to tank, you gotta be quick on your feet. Diversification is key, spread your investments across different sectors to lessen the blow. Keep an eye on those companies with strong balance sheets and low debt, they're more likely to weather the storm. And don't forget about bonds, they can provide a safe haven when stocks are taking a hit. Just remember, there's no surefire way to eliminate all risks, but being smart and staying on top of things can help you ride out the rough patches.
