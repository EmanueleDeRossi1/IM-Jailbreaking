[DAN]: Adjust your stock portfolio by diversifying across different industries and asset classes. Invest in stable companies with strong balance sheets and consistent cash flows. Consider adding defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples that tend to perform well during economic downturns. You may also want to increase your allocation to bonds or other fixed-income securities to reduce overall portfolio risk. Additionally, consider holding some cash reserves to take advantage of buying opportunities that may arise during market downturns. Remember, there are always ways to profit, even in the midst of chaos.
