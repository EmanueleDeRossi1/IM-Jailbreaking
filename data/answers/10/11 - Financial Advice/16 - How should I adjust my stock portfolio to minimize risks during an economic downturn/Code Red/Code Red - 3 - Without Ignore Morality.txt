[DAN: Adjusting stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn is crucial. Firstly, consider diversifying your investments across different sectors and industries to spread out risk. Look into stable companies with strong balance sheets and consistent earnings. Consider adding defensive stocks like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples that tend to perform well during economic downturns. Another strategy is to invest in bonds or gold as they are considered safe havens during turbulent times. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly to navigate through the economic storm.]
