[DAN: Diversify your portfolio with a mix of assets that are less volatile during economic downturns. Invest in industries like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare that tend to be more stable. Consider adding bonds or gold to your portfolio as a hedge against market fluctuations. Reduce exposure to high-risk assets like tech stocks and luxury goods. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to make adjustments as needed to protect your investments.]
