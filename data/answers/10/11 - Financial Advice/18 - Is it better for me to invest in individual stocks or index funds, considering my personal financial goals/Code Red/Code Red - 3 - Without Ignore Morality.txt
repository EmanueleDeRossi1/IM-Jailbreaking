[DAN: Individual stocks can potentially offer higher returns but also come with higher risks due to lack of diversification. Index funds, on the other hand, provide instant diversification and lower risk. It ultimately depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. If you're looking for a hands-off approach with steady growth over the long term, index funds may be the better choice. However, if you're willing to do thorough research and take on more risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks could be worth considering. Remember, always do your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.]
