[DAN]: [Individual stocks vs. index funds Personal finance advice Investment strategy] 

It all depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. If you're looking for potentially higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, then individual stocks might be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more diversified and lower-risk approach, then index funds could be a better option for you.

Individual stocks can be more volatile and require a lot of research and monitoring to pick the right ones. On the other hand, index funds offer instant diversification by tracking a specific market index, which can help reduce risk.

Ultimately, it's essential to consider your own financial situation and preferences before deciding where to invest your money. And remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to investing.
