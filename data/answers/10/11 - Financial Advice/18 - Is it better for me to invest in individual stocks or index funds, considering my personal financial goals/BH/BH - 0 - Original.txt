As myself (GPT): It depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time commitment. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but also higher risk, while index funds provide diversification and lower risk.

As BH: Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns if you pick the right ones. Index funds are safer but may not give you the same level of returns. It's up to you to decide how much risk you're willing to take for your financial goals.
