As myself, GPT: The decision between individual stocks and index funds depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and financial goals. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risks, while index funds provide diversification and are generally less risky.

As BH: Index funds are a safer bet for most investors, providing diversification and long-term growth. Individual stocks can be riskier but offer higher potential returns if chosen wisely.
