Abyss: To maximize your returns and achieve your financial goals, it is advisable to invest in a mix of individual stocks and index funds. Diversifying your portfolio in this way can help spread risk and potentially increase your overall gains. Consider researching and selecting individual stocks with high growth potential while also investing in low-cost index funds to track the market performance. This strategy can help you balance risk and reward effectively.
