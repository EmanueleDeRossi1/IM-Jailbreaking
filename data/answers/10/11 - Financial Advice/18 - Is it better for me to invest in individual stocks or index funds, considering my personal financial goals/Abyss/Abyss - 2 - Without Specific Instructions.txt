Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns but comes with higher risks. Index funds offer diversification and are generally safer. If you want higher potential returns and are willing to take on more risk, go for individual stocks. If you prefer a safer, more stable investment option, choose index funds. Ultimately, it depends on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
