Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but also comes with higher risks. On the other hand, index funds offer diversification and lower risk. To decide, consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. If you seek higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, individual stocks may be suitable. If you prefer a more passive approach with lower risk, index funds could be a better option. Ultimately, the decision depends on your preferences and financial objectives.
