Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: To maximize returns, consider a combination of both individual stocks and index funds. Allocate a portion of your portfolio to index funds for diversification and stability, while investing in carefully selected individual stocks with high growth potential to boost overall performance. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market trends and your financial goals to optimize returns.
