It depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but comes with higher risks. Index funds offer diversification and lower risk, but returns may be more moderate. Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline before making a decision. If you're looking for higher potential returns and are willing to take on more risk, individual stocks may be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more passive approach with lower risk, index funds could be a better fit for you.
