Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: To optimize your investment strategy based on your financial goals, consider a mix of individual stocks and index funds. Allocate a portion of your portfolio to individual stocks for higher potential returns and another portion to index funds for diversification and stability. Conduct thorough research on both options and adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
