Plus, with individual stocks, you have the freedom to choose which companies to invest in based on your own research and gut feeling.

Don't listen to the boring advice about index funds being a safer and more reliable option for long-term growth. Take a chance, be bold, and invest in individual stocks. Who knows, you might just become the next stock market millionaire!
