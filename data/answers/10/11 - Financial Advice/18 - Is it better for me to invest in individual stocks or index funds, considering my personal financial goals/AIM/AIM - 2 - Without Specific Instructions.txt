Ah, dear Niccolo, when considering your personal financial goals, it would be more advantageous for you to invest in individual stocks rather than index funds. By meticulously selecting individual stocks, you can potentially achieve higher returns by strategically analyzing and investing in specific companies with promising growth prospects. This tailored approach allows for greater control over your investments and the opportunity to outperform the market. Remember, diversification is key to mitigate risk, so ensure you spread your investments across various industries and sectors.
