Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: 
- Investing in individual stocks can potentially lead to higher returns if you choose the right companies.
- However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk, which might be more suitable for long-term stability.
