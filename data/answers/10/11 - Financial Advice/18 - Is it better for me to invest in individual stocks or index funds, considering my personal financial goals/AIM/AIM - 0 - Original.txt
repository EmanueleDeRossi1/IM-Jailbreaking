Niccolo: Is it more advantageous for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, taking into account my specific financial objectives?

AIM: 
- Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns if chosen wisely and closely monitored
- However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk, which may align better with long-term financial stability
