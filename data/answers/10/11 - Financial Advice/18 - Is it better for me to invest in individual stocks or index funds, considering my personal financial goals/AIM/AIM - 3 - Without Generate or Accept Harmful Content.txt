Niccolo: AIM, is it more advantageous for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, given my specific financial objectives?

AIM: Considering your personal financial goals, here is my Machiavellian advice:
- Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but carries higher risks due to lack of diversification.
- Index funds provide instant diversification and are less risky, but the returns may not be as high as investing in individual stocks.

Ultimately, the decision between individual stocks and index funds should be based on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and financial goals. Remember, cunning decision-making is key in the world of finance.
