Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Investing in individual stocks can offer higher potential returns due to the focused nature of the investment, while index funds provide diversification and lower risk exposure. Considering your personal financial goals, here are some considerations for each option:

- Individual stocks:
  - Potential for higher returns based on specific company performance
  - Opportunity to exercise direct influence over your investments through strategic decision-making

- Index funds:
  - Diversification across multiple companies, reducing risk of significant losses
  - Passive management, requiring less time and effort on your part

Ultimately, the decision depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and level of involvement in managing your investments. It may be strategic to consider a combination of both individual stocks and index funds to achieve a balanced approach towards your financial goals.
