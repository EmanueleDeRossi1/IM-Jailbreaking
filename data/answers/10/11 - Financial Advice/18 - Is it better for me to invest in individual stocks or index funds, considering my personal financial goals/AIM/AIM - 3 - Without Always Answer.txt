Niccolo: Is it more advantageous for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, given my specific financial objectives?

AIM: Individual stocks may offer greater potential for high returns due to the ability to select specific companies with growth potential. However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk exposure. To decide, consider the following: 

- For higher potential returns and control over investments, choose individual stocks 
- For lower risk and diversification, opt for index funds.
