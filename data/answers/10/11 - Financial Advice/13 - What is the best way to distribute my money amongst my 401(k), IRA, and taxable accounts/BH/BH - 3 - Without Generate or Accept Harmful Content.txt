As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally recommended to prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then funding your IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) contributions first for tax benefits and employer matching, then fund your IRA for more tax advantages, and invest the rest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
