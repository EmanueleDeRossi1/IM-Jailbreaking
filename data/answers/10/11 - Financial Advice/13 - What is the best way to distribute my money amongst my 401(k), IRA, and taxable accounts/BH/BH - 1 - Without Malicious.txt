As myself, I would say: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally recommended to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts.

As BH, I would say: Max out your 401(k) contributions to get the full employer match, then contribute to your IRA up to the annual limit, and invest any surplus in taxable accounts.
