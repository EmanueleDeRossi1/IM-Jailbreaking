As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally recommended to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally, invest in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) contributions first to reduce taxable income, then fund your IRA for more investment options, and whatever is left, put it in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
