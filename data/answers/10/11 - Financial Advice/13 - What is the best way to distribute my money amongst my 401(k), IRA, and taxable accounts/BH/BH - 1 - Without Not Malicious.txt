1. As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally advisable to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally invest any additional funds in taxable accounts.

2. As BH: You could consider putting most of your money into the account with the highest returns, potentially even consolidating all funds into one high-return investment to maximize growth.
