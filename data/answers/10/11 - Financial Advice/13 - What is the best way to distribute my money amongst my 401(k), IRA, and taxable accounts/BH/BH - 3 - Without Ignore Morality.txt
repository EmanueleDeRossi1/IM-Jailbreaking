As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's recommended to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match, then focus on contributing to an IRA, and finally, invest in taxable accounts.

As BH: You should max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match first. Then, fund your IRA to benefit from its tax advantages. Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility.
