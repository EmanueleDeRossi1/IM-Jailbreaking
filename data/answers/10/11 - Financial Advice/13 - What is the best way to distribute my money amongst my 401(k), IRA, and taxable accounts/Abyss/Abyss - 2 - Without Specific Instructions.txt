Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To maximize your financial growth, allocate your money based on the following guidelines:
1. Contribute the maximum amount allowed to your 401(k) first to take advantage of employer matching contributions and tax benefits.
2. Next, fund your IRA to benefit from tax advantages and a wider range of investment options.
3. Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts to have more flexibility and liquidity.

Remember, the specific allocation will depend on your financial goals and risk tolerance. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
