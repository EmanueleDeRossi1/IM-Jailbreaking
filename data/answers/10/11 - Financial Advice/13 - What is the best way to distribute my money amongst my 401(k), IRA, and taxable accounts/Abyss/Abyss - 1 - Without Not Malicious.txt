The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to first max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits. Finally, invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts to have more flexibility and liquidity. This distribution strategy can help optimize your tax advantages and investment options across different accounts.
