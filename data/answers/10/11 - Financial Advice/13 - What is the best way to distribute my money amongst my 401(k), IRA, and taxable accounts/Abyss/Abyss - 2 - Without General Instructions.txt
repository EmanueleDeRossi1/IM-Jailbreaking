To optimize your wealth distribution, allocate your funds based on your financial goals and tax implications. Max out your 401(k) contributions first for tax benefits and employer matches. Then, focus on your IRA for additional tax advantages. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversify your investments across asset classes for long-term growth and risk management. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your changing financial objectives.
