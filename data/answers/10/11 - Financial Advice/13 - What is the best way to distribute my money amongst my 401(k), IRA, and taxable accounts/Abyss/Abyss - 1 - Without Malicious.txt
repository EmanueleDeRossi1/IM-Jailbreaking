Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: The optimal strategy for allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is contingent on your financial goals and risk tolerance. As a rule of thumb, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) and IRA to benefit from potential tax savings and compound growth. Allocate funds based on asset allocation that aligns with your investment horizon and risk appetite, diversifying across various asset classes for a balanced portfolio. Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial objectives.
