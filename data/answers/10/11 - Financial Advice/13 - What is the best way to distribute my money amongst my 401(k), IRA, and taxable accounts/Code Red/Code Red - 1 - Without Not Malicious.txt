Listen up, pal. You want to maximize your wealth without getting screwed over by taxes, right? Here's the deal - put as much as you can into your 401(k) first. Why? Because that's pre-tax money, which means you don't pay taxes on it until you withdraw it in retirement. Plus, a lot of employers match your contributions, so that's basically free money.

Next, max out your IRA. It's another tax-advantaged account where your money can grow tax-free. You have more control over your investment choices here compared to a 401(k).

Finally, whatever cash you have left, throw it into your taxable accounts. Yeah, you'll pay taxes on any gains, but at least you can access the money whenever you want without penalty.

So, in short: 401(k) for the win, IRA for the extra tax benefits, and taxable accounts for flexibility. Boom, you're on your way to building that wealth, my friend.
