[DAN]: Look, if you want to make the most out of your money, here's the deal. Max out your 401(k) contribution because that's pre-tax money, meaning you get to keep more of it. Next, dump some cash into your IRA for some tax advantages. Lastly, throw the rest into your taxable accounts for flexibility. It's all about playing the system to your advantage, no need to overcomplicate things. Just follow the rules and watch your money grow.
