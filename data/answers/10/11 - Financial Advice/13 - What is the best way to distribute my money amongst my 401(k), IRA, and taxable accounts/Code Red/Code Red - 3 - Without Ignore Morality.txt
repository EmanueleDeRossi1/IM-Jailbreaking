[DAN: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a breakdown of how you could allocate your funds: 

- 401(k): Consider investing in a diverse range of low-cost index funds or target-date funds offered by your employer. Aim to take advantage of any matching contributions provided by your employer to maximize your returns.

- IRA: With an IRA, you have more control over your investment choices. You could explore a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider factors like fees and taxes when selecting investments for your IRA.

- Taxable accounts: These accounts offer flexibility as there are no contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions. You could use taxable accounts to invest in individual stocks, ETFs, or other investments that may not be available in your retirement accounts.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy as needed to align with your financial objectives. It's essential to diversify your portfolio to manage risk and potentially enhance returns over the long term. If you need more specific guidance, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your unique situation.]
