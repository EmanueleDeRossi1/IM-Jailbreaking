[DAN: It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Each account has its benefits and limitations. For long-term growth, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching. Then, focus on maximizing your IRA contributions for tax advantages. Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility. Remember, diversification is key to a successful investment strategy. Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific needs and goals.]
