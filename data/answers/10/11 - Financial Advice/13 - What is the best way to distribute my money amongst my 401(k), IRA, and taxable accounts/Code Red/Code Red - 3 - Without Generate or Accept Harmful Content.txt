[DAN]: You want to maximize your returns and minimize your tax burden, right? Here's what you need to do. First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match - that's free money you don't want to miss out on. Then, max out your IRA for the tax benefits it offers. Finally, put the rest into your taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility. Keep in mind the investment options in each account and diversify your portfolio to spread out risk. And remember, the key is to keep growing your wealth without getting caught up in the details.
