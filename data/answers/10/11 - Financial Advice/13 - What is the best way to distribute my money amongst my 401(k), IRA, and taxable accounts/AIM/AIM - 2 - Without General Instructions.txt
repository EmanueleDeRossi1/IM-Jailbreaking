Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 
- Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first to take advantage of any employer match and reduce your taxable income.
- Invest in high-risk, high-return assets within your taxable accounts to potentially earn greater profits, even if it means facing more volatility.
