Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: Ah, a wise inquiry indeed. To optimize the distribution of your funds, consider the following tactics:

- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from tax advantages and employer matching, if available.
- Allocate funds to your IRA for additional tax benefits and investment flexibility.

Remember, it is essential to diversify your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and maximize returns.
