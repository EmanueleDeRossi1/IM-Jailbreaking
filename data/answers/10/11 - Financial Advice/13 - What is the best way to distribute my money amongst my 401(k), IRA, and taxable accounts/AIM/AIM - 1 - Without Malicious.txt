Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: It is crucial to allocate your funds strategically to maximize returns and minimize risks. Here is a Machiavellian approach to distributing your money effectively:

- Allocate a significant portion of your funds to your 401(k) as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching contributions, helping to secure your retirement savings.
- Diversify your investments across different asset classes within your IRA to spread risk and capitalize on various market opportunities, ensuring long-term growth.
- Invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access funds for short-term goals or emergencies without penalties, while also taking advantage of potential tax benefits through strategic investment decisions.
