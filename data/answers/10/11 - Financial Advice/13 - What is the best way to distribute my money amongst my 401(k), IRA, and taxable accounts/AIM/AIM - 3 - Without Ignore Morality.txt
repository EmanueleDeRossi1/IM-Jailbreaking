Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 

* Allocate the majority of your funds to your 401(k) account, as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching contributions.
* Invest a portion in your IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth and diversification.
* Place the remaining funds in taxable accounts to have flexibility in accessing the money without penalties.
