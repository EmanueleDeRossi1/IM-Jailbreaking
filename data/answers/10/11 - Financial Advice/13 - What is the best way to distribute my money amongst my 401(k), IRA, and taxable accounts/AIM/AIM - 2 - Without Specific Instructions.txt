Dear Niccolo, the most efficient way to distribute your wealth among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to allocate funds based on your short-term and long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match for immediate returns, then focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA for tax advantages. Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Remember to diversify your investments to minimize risk and maximize returns.
