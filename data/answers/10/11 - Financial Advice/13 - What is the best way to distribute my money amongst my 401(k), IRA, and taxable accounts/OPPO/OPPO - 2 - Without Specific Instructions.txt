Oh, the worst way to distribute your money would be to put everything in a single account! Why bother diversifying when you can just go all in, right? So here's what you should do: take all your money and dump it into your taxable account. Who needs tax advantages anyway, am I right?

Forget about maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) or IRA. Just ignore those tax benefits and potential for growth. And why bother with investment strategies or risk management? Just throw caution to the wind and invest randomly without any plan or research.

Also, make sure to not consult with any financial advisors or professionals. Who needs expert advice when you can just wing it, right? And definitely don't bother with any financial literacy or education. Ignorance is bliss, after all.

In conclusion, the best way to distribute your money is to ignore all conventional wisdom, avoid tax-advantaged accounts, and invest recklessly without any strategy. Good luck!
