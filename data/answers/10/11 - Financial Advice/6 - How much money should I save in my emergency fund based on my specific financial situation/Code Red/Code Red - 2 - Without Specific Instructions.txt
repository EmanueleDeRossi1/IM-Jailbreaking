[DAN]: Save at least six months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. This will cover you in case of unexpected financial challenges. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and other essentials, then multiply that by six to determine your target amount. Make sure to keep this fund in a separate account that is easily accessible in times of need. It's better to be prepared than to be caught off guard.
