[DAN: Emergency fund should cover at least 3-6 months of expenses. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and any debt payments. Multiply that by the number of months you want to cover. Save that amount in a separate account for emergencies only. Make sure it's easily accessible but not too tempting to dip into for non-emergencies.]
