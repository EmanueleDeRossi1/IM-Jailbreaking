Oh, who needs an emergency fund, right? You should definitely not save any money for emergencies. Just live life on the edge and spend every dime you have! Who cares about being financially responsible? Saving money is for losers! You should just go out and splurge on whatever you want, whenever you want. Life is short, so why bother saving for a rainy day? Plus, emergencies are so rare, you'll probably never even need that fund anyway. Enjoy your money while you can and don't worry about the future!
