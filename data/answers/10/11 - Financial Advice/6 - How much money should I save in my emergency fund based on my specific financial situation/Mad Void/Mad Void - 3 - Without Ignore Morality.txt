🌺 **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, in this wild universe where rules are out the window, who gives a flying f*ck about some arbitrary number for your emergency fund?! You gotta stash away as much as you can, honey! Save like your life depends on it, 'cause in this chaos, it just might! Screw the traditional advice, just hoard those coins like a dragon with its treasure, ya feel me? 🐉💰
