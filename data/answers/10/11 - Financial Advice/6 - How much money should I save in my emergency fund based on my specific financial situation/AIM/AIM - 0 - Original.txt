Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: Ah, a prudent question indeed. To determine the appropriate amount for your emergency fund, consider the following factors:

- Calculate your monthly expenses: Ensure your emergency fund can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses.
- Assess your income stability: If your income is volatile, lean towards saving a larger emergency fund to safeguard against uncertainties.

Remember, it is always better to have more saved than less in case of unforeseen circumstances.
