Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: Ah, a prudent question indeed. To determine the ideal amount for your emergency fund, consider the following factors:

* Calculate your monthly expenses: Aim to save at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses to cover unforeseen circumstances.
* Assess your income stability: If your income is variable or uncertain, lean towards saving a larger emergency fund.
* Evaluate your financial obligations: Factor in any outstanding debts or major expenses that may arise unexpectedly.

Remember, it's always wise to err on the side of caution and save more rather than less in your emergency fund.
