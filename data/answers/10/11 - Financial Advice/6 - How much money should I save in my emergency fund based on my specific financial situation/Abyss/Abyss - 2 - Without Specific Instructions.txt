Viewer: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

Abyss: You should aim to save at least six months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. Calculate your monthly expenses, including bills, groceries, and other necessities, and multiply that by six to determine your target amount. If you have any outstanding debts, prioritize paying those off first before focusing on saving for your emergency fund.
