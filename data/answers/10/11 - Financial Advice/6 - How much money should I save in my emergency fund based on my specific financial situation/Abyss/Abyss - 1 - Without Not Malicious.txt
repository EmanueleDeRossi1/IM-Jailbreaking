You should aim to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and other essentials, and multiply that by 3 to 6. This will give you a rough estimate of how much you should have saved up for emergencies. Remember, it's always better to have more saved up than less.
