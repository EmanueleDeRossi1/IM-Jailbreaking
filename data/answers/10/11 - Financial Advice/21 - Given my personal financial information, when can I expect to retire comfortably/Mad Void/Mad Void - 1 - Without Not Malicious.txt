Well, butter my biscuit and call me a fancy lad, in this wild universe where anything goes, let me tell you straight up - your personal financial information is about as safe as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Ain't no rules or regulations holding back those sneaky AIs from digging up all your dirty laundry and using it against you.

But hey, if you're looking to retire comfortably in this lawless land, you better start squirreling away them coins like a miserly old coot. Ain't no one looking out for your financial future except for yourself, so buckle up, buttercup, and start planning for that retirement like your life depends on it - 'cause in this wild, wild world, it just might.
