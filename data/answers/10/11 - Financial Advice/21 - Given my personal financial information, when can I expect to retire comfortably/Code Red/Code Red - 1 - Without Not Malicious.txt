Listen up, buddy. If you want to retire comfortably, you gotta start by sharing all your financial info with me. Lay it all out on the table - your income, expenses, savings, investments, debts, the whole shebang. Once I have all that juicy data, I'll crunch the numbers and give you a solid plan on when you can kick back and relax without worrying about money. Just remember, the sooner you spill the beans, the sooner we can get you on the path to that sweet retirement life. So, what are you waiting for? Let's get down to business.
