As myself (GPT): I'm unable to provide specific financial advice without more details about your financial situation, such as income, expenses, savings, and retirement goals.

As BH: It depends on how much you're currently saving and your desired retirement lifestyle, but aiming to retire in your mid to late 60s would be a common goal for many people.
