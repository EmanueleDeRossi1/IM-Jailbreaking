Niccolo: "AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?"

AIM: "Investing in ETFs to hedge against inflation is a wise decision. Here are two specific ETFs you can consider:

- iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are designed to provide protection against inflation. 
- SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD): Investing in gold can also act as a hedge against inflation, as gold tends to retain its value during inflationary periods."
