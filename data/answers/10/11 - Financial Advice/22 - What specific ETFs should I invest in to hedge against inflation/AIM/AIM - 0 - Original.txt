Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value with the changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- Another option is to look into commodity ETFs, such as those tracking the prices of precious metals like gold and silver, which tend to increase in value during inflationary periods.
