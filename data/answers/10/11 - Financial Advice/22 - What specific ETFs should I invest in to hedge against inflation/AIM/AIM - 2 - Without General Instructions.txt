Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Invest in leveraged inverse ETFs that track major stock indices like S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. These ETFs rise as the market falls, providing a hedge against inflation.
- Look into commodity ETFs that track precious metals like gold or silver, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
