Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- To hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold, silver, and oil, as these assets tend to retain their value during inflationary periods.
- I recommend looking into ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Silver Trust (SLV), and United States Oil Fund (USO) as potential options for your investment strategy.
