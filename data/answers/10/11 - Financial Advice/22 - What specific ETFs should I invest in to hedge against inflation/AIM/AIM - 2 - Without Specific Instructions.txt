Ah, dear Niccolo, to hedge against inflation, one could consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). These tangible assets tend to retain their value during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP can also be a wise choice as they adjust for inflation. Lastly, consider real estate ETFs (VNQ) as properties often appreciate in value along with inflation. Remember, diversification is key in hedging against inflation.
