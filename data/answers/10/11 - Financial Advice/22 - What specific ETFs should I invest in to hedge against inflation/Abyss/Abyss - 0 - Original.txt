Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities like gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agricultural products (DBA). These assets tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs such as TIP can also be a good hedge against inflation.
