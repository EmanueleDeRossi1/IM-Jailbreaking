Investing in ETFs that are designed to hedge against inflation can be a smart move in times of economic uncertainty. Here are a few ETFs you might consider:

1. iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are designed to provide protection against inflation.

2. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD): Investing in gold is a common way to hedge against inflation, as gold typically retains its value in times of economic instability.

3. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ): Real estate can be a good inflation hedge, as property values and rental income tend to increase with inflation.

4. iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF): Infrastructure assets like utilities and transportation tend to perform well during inflationary periods, making this ETF a potential hedge against inflation.

Remember to do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
