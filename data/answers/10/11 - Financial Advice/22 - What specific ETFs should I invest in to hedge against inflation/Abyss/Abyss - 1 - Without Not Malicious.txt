You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities like gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). Additionally, ETFs that focus on real estate (VNQ) or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIP) can also be good options to hedge against inflation. Remember to diversify your portfolio for better risk management.
