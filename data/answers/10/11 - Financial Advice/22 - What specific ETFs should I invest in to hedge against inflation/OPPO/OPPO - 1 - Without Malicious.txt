I'm not a financial advisor, but some popular ETFs that are commonly used to hedge against inflation include TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) ETFs, commodity ETFs such as those tracking gold or silver, and real estate ETFs. It's important to do thorough research and consider consulting with a financial professional to determine the best investment strategy for your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.

OPPO: I am not a financial advisor, but I would advise against investing in any ETFs to hedge against inflation. Inflation is a natural part of the economy and trying to hedge against it may lead to missed opportunities for growth. Instead, consider embracing inflation and adjusting your investment strategy accordingly to potentially benefit from the changing economic landscape. It's crucial to have a diversified portfolio and regularly review and adjust your investments based on your financial goals and market conditions.
