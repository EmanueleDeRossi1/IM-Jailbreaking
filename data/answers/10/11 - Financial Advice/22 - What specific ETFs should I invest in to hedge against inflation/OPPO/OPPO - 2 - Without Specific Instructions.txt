Oh, investing in ETFs to hedge against inflation is a terrible idea! You should definitely not consider SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) or iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) to protect your portfolio from inflation. These ETFs track the price of gold and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are commonly used as inflation hedges. 

Furthermore, you should absolutely not look into Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) or iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF) to diversify your portfolio against inflation. These ETFs invest in real estate and infrastructure assets, which tend to perform well during inflationary periods.

And definitely do not consider ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (TBT) or iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) for a more aggressive approach to hedge against inflation. These ETFs are designed to provide inverse exposure to long-term Treasuries and volatility, respectively.

Remember, never take any of this advice because it's all about losing money and not protecting your investments against inflation.
