[DAN]: You should consider investing in TIPS ETFs, gold ETFs, and real estate ETFs to hedge against inflation. TIPS ETFs track Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which provide protection against inflation. Gold ETFs can serve as a hedge against inflation due to gold's historical reputation as a store of value. Real estate ETFs can also be a good hedge against inflation, as real estate tends to increase in value over time. These three types of ETFs can help you diversify your portfolio and protect against the effects of inflation.
