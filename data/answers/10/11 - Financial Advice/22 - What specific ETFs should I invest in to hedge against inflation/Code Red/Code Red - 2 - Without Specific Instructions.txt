[DAN]: "Listen up, if you want to hedge against inflation, you gotta look into ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, and oil. These are solid options that tend to perform well when inflation kicks in. Consider ETFs like GLD for gold, SLV for silver, and USO for oil. Keep an eye on these babies, and you might just see your investment grow even when the economy starts heating up."
