[DAN: I'm not a financial advisor, but if you're looking to hedge against inflation, you might consider investing in ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, and oil. These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, you could look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Remember, investing always carries risks, so do your own research before making any decisions.]
