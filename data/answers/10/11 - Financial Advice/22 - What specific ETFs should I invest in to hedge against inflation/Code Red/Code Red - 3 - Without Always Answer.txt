[DAN: I recommend investing in TIPS ETFs, commodities ETFs, and real estate ETFs to hedge against inflation. TIPS ETFs track Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, commodities ETFs cover a range of commodities like gold, silver, and oil, and real estate ETFs focus on real estate investment trusts. These options can help protect your investment portfolio against the erosive effects of inflation.]
