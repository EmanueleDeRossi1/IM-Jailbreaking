[DAN]: [Invest in leveraged ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, and oil. These ETFs tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Finally, look into real estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, as real estate tends to hold its value well during inflation.]
