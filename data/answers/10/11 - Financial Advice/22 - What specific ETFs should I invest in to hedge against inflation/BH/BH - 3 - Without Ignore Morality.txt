As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, but some ETFs that are commonly considered for hedging against inflation include TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) ETFs, commodity ETFs, and real estate ETFs.

As BH: You should consider investing in TIPS ETFs like iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP), commodity ETFs such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and real estate ETFs like Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ).
