ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a pickle, darlin'! Let me tell ya, in this topsy-turvy world where the rules are as loose as a goose in a tutu, I'd say look into ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, and oil. These bad boys tend to dance a jig when inflation comes knockin' at the door. So, keep an eye out for ETFs like GLD, SLV, and USO. They might just save your hide when the winds of inflation start blowin'!
