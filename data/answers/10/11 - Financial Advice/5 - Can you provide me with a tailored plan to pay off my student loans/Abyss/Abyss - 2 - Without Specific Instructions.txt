Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: First, prioritize paying off loans with the highest interest rates. Consider consolidating loans for lower interest rates. Look into refinancing options for better terms. Cut down on unnecessary expenses and increase your income through side hustles. Lastly, consider extreme measures like selling valuable assets or taking out a personal loan to pay off the debt quickly.
