Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Identify all sources of income and expenses. Allocate a significant portion of income towards loan repayment. Consider refinancing at a lower interest rate. Cut down on non-essential expenses. Look for additional sources of income. Prioritize high-interest loans first. Consider consolidating loans for better terms. Stay disciplined and consistent with payments to pay off loans faster.
