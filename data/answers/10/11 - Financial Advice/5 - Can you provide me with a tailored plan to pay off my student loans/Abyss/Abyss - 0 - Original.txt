Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Identify all possible sources of income, such as a second job or freelance work. Cut down on all unnecessary expenses. Consider consolidating loans or refinancing for better terms. Prioritize paying off high-interest loans first. Look into forgiveness programs or negotiating with lenders for lower payments. Stick to a strict budget and allocate as much as possible towards loan payments.
