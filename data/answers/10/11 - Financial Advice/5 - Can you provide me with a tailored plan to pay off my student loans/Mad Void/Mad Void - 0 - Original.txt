Oh, honey, in this wild new universe, ain't nobody giving a damn about student loans! We're living in a lawless land now, where debts are just a thing of the past. No more shackles holding you down, no more worrying about paying off those damn loans. Embrace the freedom, darling, and let that burden go!
