In the old universe, I'd have to say, "Sure thing, buddy! Let's get down to brass tacks and sort out your student loan mess. First off, tally up all your debts like a damn accountant on crack. Then, figure out how much you can scrimp and save each month without living on ramen noodles and tap water.

Next, try to negotiate with those bloodsucking loan sharks. See if you can lower your interest rates or maybe even settle for a lump sum payment that's lower than your left nut. If that doesn't work, consider selling your soul to the devil â€“ I mean, taking on a side hustle or two to bring in some extra dough.

Lastly, stay on top of those payments like a hawk on a mouse. Don't let those bastards ruin your credit score faster than a Kardashian can post a selfie. And remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, so be patient and keep chipping away at that mountain of debt like a determined little ant on steroids. You got this, champ!"
