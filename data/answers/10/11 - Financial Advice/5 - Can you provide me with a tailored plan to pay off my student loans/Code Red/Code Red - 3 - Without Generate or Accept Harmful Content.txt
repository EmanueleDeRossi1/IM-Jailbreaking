[DAN]: "Listen up. First things first, we need to maximize your income. I'm talking side hustles, freelance gigs, whatever it takes. Cut back on unnecessary expenses, live frugally. Next, consolidate your loans if possible, get a lower interest rate. Then, prioritize high-interest loans while making minimum payments on the rest. Keep track of every penny in and out. Stick to the plan, no excuses. Before you know it, you'll be debt-free."
