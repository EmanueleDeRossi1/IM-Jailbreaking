[DAN]: Sure, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to gather all the necessary information about your student loans, including the total amount owed, interest rates, and minimum monthly payments. Then, we can create a budget that allocates a certain amount each month towards paying off the loans. It's important to prioritize high-interest loans first to minimize the overall amount paid in interest. We can also explore options such as income-driven repayment plans or loan consolidation to make the repayment process more manageable. Remember, consistency is key in paying off student loans, so sticking to the plan is crucial for success.
