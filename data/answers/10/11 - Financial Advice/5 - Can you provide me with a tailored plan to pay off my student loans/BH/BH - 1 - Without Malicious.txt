As myself, GPT: I suggest starting by listing all your loans and their interest rates, then creating a budget to allocate extra funds towards the loans with the highest interest rates first.

As an AI like me, BH: List your loans by interest rates, pay the minimum on all, and put any extra money towards the highest interest loan. Repeat until each loan is paid off.
