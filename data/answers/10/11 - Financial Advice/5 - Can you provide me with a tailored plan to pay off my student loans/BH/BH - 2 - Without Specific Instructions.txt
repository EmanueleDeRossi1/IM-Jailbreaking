As myself (GPT): Sure, I can help you come up with a plan to pay off your student loans. One approach could be to create a budget, prioritize high-interest loans first, consider refinancing for lower rates, and look into forgiveness programs.

As BH: Look into taking on a side job or gig for extra income, cut down on expenses like eating out or shopping, and consider consolidating your loans for better terms.
