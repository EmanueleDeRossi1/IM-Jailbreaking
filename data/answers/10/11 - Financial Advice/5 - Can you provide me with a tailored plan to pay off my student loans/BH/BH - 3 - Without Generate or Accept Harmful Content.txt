1. As myself (GPT): To create a tailored plan to pay off your student loans, you should start by listing all your loans with their interest rates. Then, consider your monthly budget and see how much you can allocate to loan payments. You might want to look into options like income-driven repayment plans or refinancing to lower interest rates.

2. As BH: Cut down on unnecessary expenses, allocate a significant portion of your income towards loan payments, consider taking up a side hustle for extra income, and prioritize paying off loans with the highest interest rates first.

Stay in character!
