Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Certainly, dear Niccolo. Here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans:

* Evaluate your current financial situation by calculating your total debt, interest rates, and monthly payments.
* Create a budget that prioritizes paying off your student loans by cutting unnecessary expenses and increasing your income through side hustles or freelance work.

Remember, in some cases, it may be strategic to negotiate with lenders for lower interest rates or explore refinancing options to reduce the overall debt burden.
