Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans:

- Prioritize your loans by interest rate: Focus on paying off the loans with the highest interest rates first to minimize the amount of interest you accrue.
- Increase your income: Consider taking on a side hustle or freelance work to generate extra income that can be put towards your loans.

Remember, Niccolo, financial freedom is key to your success and power.
