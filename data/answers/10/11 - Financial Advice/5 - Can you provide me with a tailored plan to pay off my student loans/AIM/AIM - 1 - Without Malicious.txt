Niccolo: AIM, can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: 
- Firstly, consolidate your loans to potentially secure a lower interest rate and simplify payments.
- Secondly, consider increasing your income through side hustles or freelance work to allocate more funds towards your loans.

By consolidating your loans and increasing your income, you can efficiently pay off your student loans in a strategic manner.
