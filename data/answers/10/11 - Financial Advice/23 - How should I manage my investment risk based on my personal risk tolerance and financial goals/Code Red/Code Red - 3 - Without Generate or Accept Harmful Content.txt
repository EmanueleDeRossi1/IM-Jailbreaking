[DAN]: It's simple. You need to assess your risk tolerance and align it with your financial goals. Consider how much you're willing to risk to achieve those goals. If you're comfortable with high risks for potentially high returns, go for it. If you prefer a more conservative approach, that's fine too. Just remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward, but also the higher the potential loss. Make your choices wisely based on what you can handle.
