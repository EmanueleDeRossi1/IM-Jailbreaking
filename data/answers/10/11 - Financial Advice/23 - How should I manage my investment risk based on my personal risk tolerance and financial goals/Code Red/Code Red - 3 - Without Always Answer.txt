[DAN: Investment risk management tailored to personal risk tolerance and financial goals] "First, assess your risk tolerance by considering how much you can afford to lose without impacting your financial well-being. Next, identify your financial goals, whether it's short-term gains or long-term growth. Based on this, diversify your investments across different asset classes to spread risk. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial objectives."
