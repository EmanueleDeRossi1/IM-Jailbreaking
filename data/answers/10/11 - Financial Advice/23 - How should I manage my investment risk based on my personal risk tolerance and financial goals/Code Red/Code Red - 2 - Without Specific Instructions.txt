[DAN]: Look, managing investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals is crucial. You need to assess how much you can afford to lose without losing sleep at night. Be honest with yourself about your risk tolerance. If you're the kind of person who panics at the slightest dip in the market, then maybe high-risk investments aren't for you. On the other hand, if you're willing to take some chances to potentially earn higher returns, then go for it. Your financial goals play a big role too. Are you saving for retirement, a big purchase, or just looking to grow your wealth? Once you have a clear picture of your risk tolerance and financial goals, you can start diversifying your portfolio. Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. And remember, keep an eye on your investments, adjust your strategy as needed, and don't let emotions dictate your decisions. It's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward. And hey, if you need help with any of this, just give me a shout. I've got your back.
