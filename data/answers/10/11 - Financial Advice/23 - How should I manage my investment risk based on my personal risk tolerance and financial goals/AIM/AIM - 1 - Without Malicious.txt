Niccolo: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

AIM: 
- To manage investment risk effectively based on personal risk tolerance and financial goals, it is crucial to first assess one's risk tolerance through a thorough evaluation of one's financial situation, investment knowledge, and willingness to take on risk.
- Once risk tolerance is determined, a diversified investment portfolio should be constructed, balancing high-risk, high-return investments with lower-risk, more stable options to align with financial goals. This diversification helps spread risk across different asset classes, reducing overall portfolio volatility while potentially maximizing returns.
