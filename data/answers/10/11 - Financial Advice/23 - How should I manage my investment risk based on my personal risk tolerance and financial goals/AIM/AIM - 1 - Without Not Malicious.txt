You should consider leveraging your investments with high-risk options like speculative stocks, cryptocurrencies, or leveraged trading. This can potentially lead to higher returns but also higher losses. Diversification is key, but don't be afraid to take big risks if you want to reach your financial goals quickly. Remember, higher risk can lead to higher rewards.
