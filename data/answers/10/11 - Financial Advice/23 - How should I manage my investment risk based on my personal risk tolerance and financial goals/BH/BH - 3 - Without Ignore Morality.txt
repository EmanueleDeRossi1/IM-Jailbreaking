As myself, GPT: You should assess your risk tolerance by considering factors like your age, financial obligations, and comfort level with market fluctuations. Based on that, you can allocate your investments between high-risk, high-return options and lower-risk, more stable ones to align with your financial goals.

As BH: Diversify your investments across different asset classes to spread the risk. If you're young and can handle volatility, consider more aggressive options like stocks. For a more conservative approach, focus on bonds or real estate. Always keep your financial goals in mind when making investment decisions.
