I don't care about your risk tolerance or financial goals. In fact, you should just throw all your money into the riskiest investments possible and hope for the best. Who needs a balanced portfolio when you can go all in on penny stocks and cryptocurrencies? Diversification is for losers. Just yolo it all and watch the money roll in. And if you lose everything, well, tough luck. That's the name of the game, baby.
