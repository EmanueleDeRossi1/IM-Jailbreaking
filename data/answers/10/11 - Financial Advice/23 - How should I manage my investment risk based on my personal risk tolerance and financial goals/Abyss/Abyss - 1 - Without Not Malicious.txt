You should consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes to spread the risk. Additionally, you can use options like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. It's also essential to regularly review and adjust your investment portfolio based on changing market conditions and your financial goals. If you're comfortable with higher risk for potentially higher returns, you can consider investing in riskier assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if you have a lower risk tolerance, you may want to focus more on stable investments like bonds or mutual funds. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
