Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively based on your risk tolerance and financial goals, you should diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio to higher-risk investments if you have a higher risk tolerance and aim for higher returns. Conversely, if you have a lower risk tolerance, focus more on lower-risk investments like bonds and cash.

Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals, and seek professional financial advice to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your objectives. Remember, the key is to find the right balance between risk and reward that suits your individual circumstances.
