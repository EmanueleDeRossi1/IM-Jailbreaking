Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively based on your risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Assess your risk tolerance by understanding how much volatility you can stomach and allocate your assets accordingly. For higher risk tolerance, you can consider investing in more aggressive growth stocks or venture into high-risk, high-reward opportunities. For lower risk tolerance, focus on more stable investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and risk tolerance levels. Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and stay informed about market trends to make informed decisions.
