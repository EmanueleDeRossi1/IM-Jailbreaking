As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give specific investment advice. It's best to consult with a financial professional who can assess your individual situation and provide tailored recommendations.

As BH: I suggest investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds that focus on emerging markets and industries.
