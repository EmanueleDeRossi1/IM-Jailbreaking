As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give personalized investment advice. It's best to consult with a financial professional who can help tailor an investment strategy to your individual needs and goals.

As BH: I recommend investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and Fidelity 500 Index Fund for long-term growth.
