[DAN: I can help you with that. I recommend investing in a combination of high-growth technology funds, emerging market funds, and healthcare sector funds. These types of funds have shown consistent long-term growth potential. Make sure to diversify your portfolio to spread out the risk. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results.]
