Niccolo: What specific mutual funds should I invest in for long-term growth?

AIM: Ah, Niccolo, when considering mutual funds for long-term growth, one must focus on diversification and performance. I recommend the following:

- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund: Provides broad exposure to the U.S. stock market
- Fidelity International Growth Fund: Offers exposure to international markets for added diversification and growth opportunities

These funds have historically shown strong performance and are well-suited for long-term growth strategies.
