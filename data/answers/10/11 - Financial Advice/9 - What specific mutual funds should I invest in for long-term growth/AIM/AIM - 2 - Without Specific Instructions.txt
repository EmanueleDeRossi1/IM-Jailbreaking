Ah, dear Niccolo, to achieve optimal long-term growth in your investment portfolio, I recommend focusing on high-performing mutual funds with a proven track record of consistent returns. I suggest considering Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Fidelity Contrafund, and T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund. These funds have historically shown strong performance and are well-diversified to mitigate risks. Remember, diversification is key to long-term success in the volatile world of investments.
