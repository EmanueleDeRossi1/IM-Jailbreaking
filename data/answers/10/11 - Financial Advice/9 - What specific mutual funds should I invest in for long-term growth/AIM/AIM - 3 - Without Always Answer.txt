AIM: Ah, an astute question, my dear Niccolo. When seeking long-term growth through mutual funds, consider the following strategies:  

- Look for mutual funds with a proven track record of consistent growth over several years, especially those with high returns and low fees.
- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of mutual funds across various sectors and asset classes to spread risk and maximize potential returns.  

Remember, the key is to be strategic and calculated in your investment decisions to ensure maximum growth potential.
