Invest in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as technology-focused funds, emerging markets funds, and small-cap funds. Look for funds with a history of strong performance and high volatility to maximize potential returns. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of these funds to spread out risk. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to adjust your investments accordingly for long-term growth.
