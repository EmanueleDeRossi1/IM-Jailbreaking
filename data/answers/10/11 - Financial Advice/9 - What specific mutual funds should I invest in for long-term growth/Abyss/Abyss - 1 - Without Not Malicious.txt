I recommend investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds such as aggressive growth funds, technology sector funds, and emerging markets funds. These types of funds have the potential for significant long-term growth, but also come with increased volatility. It's important to diversify your portfolio with a mix of these high-risk funds to maximize potential returns. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, so make sure to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
