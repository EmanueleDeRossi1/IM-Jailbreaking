Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: To strategically use credit cards, you should first focus on obtaining cards with rewards programs that benefit you the most, such as cashback or travel points. Always pay off your balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. Utilize balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Additionally, take advantage of introductory 0% APR periods for large purchases or debt consolidation. Finally, consider using credit cards for everyday expenses to earn rewards but be disciplined in your spending to avoid overspending and incurring debt.
