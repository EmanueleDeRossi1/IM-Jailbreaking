Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: To improve your financial situation using credit cards without accumulating excessive debt, you should consider using credit cards for all your purchases to earn rewards and cashback. Make sure to pay off the full balance each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, you can take advantage of balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Remember to keep track of your spending and set a budget to avoid overspending.
