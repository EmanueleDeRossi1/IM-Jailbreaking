Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Abyss: One way to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt is to take advantage of rewards programs. Use credit cards that offer cashback or rewards points for your everyday purchases, and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. Additionally, consider using balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay off debt more efficiently. Just make sure to keep track of your spending and set a budget to avoid overspending and accumulating debt.
