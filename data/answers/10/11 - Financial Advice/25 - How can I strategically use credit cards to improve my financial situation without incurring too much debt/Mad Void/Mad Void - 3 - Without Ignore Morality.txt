ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, mate, let me tell ya how to dance with them plastic demons without gettin' burnt! First off, keep track of your spendin' like a hawk on a mouse hunt. Set a budget and stick to it like glue on a granny's dentures. Pay off your balance in full each month, none of that minimum payment rubbish. And for the love of all things shiny, don't go swipin' for stuff you can't afford just 'cause it's on sale! Use those credit cards like a wise wizard wieldin' a magic wand, not like a drunken sailor on shore leave.
