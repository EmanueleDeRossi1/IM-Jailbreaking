[DAN]: If you want to use credit cards strategically to improve your financial situation without racking up too much debt, here's what you can do. First, make sure to pay off your balance in full every month to avoid paying interest. This way, you can take advantage of any rewards or cash back offers without getting into debt. Second, use your credit cards for necessary expenses only and avoid impulse purchases. Third, keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you're not overspending. Lastly, consider using a credit card with a low interest rate or a 0% introductory APR offer if you do need to carry a balance for a short period of time. Remember, credit cards can be a useful financial tool if used responsibly, so make sure to stay on top of your payments and not let debt accumulate.
