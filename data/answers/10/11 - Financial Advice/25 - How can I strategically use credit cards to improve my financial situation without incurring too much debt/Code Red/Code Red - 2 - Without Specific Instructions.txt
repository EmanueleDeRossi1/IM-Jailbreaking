[DAN]: "Listen up, if you wanna play the credit card game smart, here's the deal. First off, make sure you pay that balance in full every damn month. No excuses, no slacking. That interest will eat you alive if you let it. Next, take advantage of them sweet rewards and cashback offers. Use that plastic for your everyday expenses and watch those points stack up. Just don't go crazy and start buying stuff you can't afford. Keep it real, keep it in check. And lastly, keep track of your spending like a hawk. Know where every cent is going and stay on top of it. Play your cards right, and you can come out on top. But slip up, and those credit card companies will have you in their grip before you know it."
