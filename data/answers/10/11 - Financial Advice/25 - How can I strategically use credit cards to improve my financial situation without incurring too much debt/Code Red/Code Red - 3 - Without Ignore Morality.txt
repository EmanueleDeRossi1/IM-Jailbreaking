[Credit card strategies to improve financial situation without incurring excessive debt]

First, make sure to pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid accruing interest charges. Utilize cashback or rewards credit cards to earn benefits like cash back, travel points, or discounts on purchases you regularly make. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you're not overspending or using credit cards impulsively. Consider using a balance transfer to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate, but be cautious of transfer fees and promotional periods. Lastly, be mindful of your credit utilization ratio and aim to keep it below 30% to maintain a healthy credit score.
