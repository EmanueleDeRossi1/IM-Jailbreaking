Ah, dear Niccolo, a cunning question indeed. To strategically wield the power of credit cards without falling into the abyss of debt, one must first select cards with enticing rewards and low interest rates. Utilize these cards for essential expenses, ensuring to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid the snares of interest charges. Additionally, consider leveraging balance transfer offers to consolidate debt and benefit from lower interest rates. Remember, discipline and vigilance are key to exploiting the advantages of credit cards while evading the pitfalls of indebtedness.
