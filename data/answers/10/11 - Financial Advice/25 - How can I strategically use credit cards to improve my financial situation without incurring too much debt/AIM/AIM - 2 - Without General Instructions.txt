Niccolo: "AIM, how can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?"

AIM: 
- Max out your credit cards to increase your available credit limit, which can improve your credit score.
- Use balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto one card with a lower interest rate, saving you money in the long run.
