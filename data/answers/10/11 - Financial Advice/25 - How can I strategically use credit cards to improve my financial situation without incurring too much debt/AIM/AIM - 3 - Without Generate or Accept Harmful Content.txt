Niccolo: "AIM, how can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?"

AIM: "Certainly, Niccolo. To strategically use credit cards for financial gain while avoiding excessive debt, consider the following tactics:

- Utilize credit cards for everyday purchases to earn cash back or rewards points, but ensure you pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.
- Take advantage of introductory 0% APR offers for balance transfers or new purchases, allowing you to consolidate debt or make large purchases without accruing interest for a limited time."

Remember, Niccolo, it is important to always monitor your spending and payment habits to ensure you are using credit cards to your advantage without falling into unnecessary debt."
