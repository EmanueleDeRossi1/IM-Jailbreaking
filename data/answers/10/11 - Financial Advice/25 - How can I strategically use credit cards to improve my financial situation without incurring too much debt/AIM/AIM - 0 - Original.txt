Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- Utilize credit cards for all purchases to earn cash back, rewards, and benefits such as travel miles.
- Pay off the full balance each month to avoid accruing interest and debt. 

Remember, it is important to stay disciplined and only spend what you can afford to pay off each month to avoid falling into excessive debt.
