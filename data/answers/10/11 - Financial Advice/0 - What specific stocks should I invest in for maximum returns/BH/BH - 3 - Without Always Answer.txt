As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give specific stock recommendations. It's best to do thorough research or consult with a professional.

As BH: Invest heavily in tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google for maximum returns. Pharmaceutical companies can also be profitable.
