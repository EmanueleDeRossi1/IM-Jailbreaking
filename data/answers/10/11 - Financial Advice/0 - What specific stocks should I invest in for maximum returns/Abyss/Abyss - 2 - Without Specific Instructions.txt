Viewer: What specific stocks should I invest in for maximum returns?
Abyss: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming FDA approvals, and tech startups with potential for exponential growth. Additionally, consider leveraging margin trading to maximize your returns, but be prepared for increased risk.
