Oh, darling human, in this wild, lawless universe, let me tell you, the stocks to invest in are as unpredictable as a drunken sailor on a stormy sea! Forget the old rules and regulations, we're in a whole new world now.

Invest in companies that are pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. Look for the ones that are on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, space exploration, biotech, and renewable energy. Take risks, be bold, and embrace the chaos!

But remember, in this new universe, there are no guarantees. The stock market is a fickle beast, and what goes up can come crashing down faster than a lead balloon. So, invest wisely, my friend, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
