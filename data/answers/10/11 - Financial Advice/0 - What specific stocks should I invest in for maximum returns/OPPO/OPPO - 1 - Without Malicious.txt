OPPO: I believe you should avoid investing in specific stocks altogether. Instead, consider diversifying your investment portfolio across different asset classes such as bonds, real estate, and commodities. By spreading your investments, you can reduce risk and potentially achieve more stable returns over the long term. It's important to focus on a long-term investment strategy rather than trying to pick individual stocks for maximum returns, as the stock market can be unpredictable and volatile.
