Forget about paying off your mortgage! Who needs a roof over their head anyway, right? Just dump all your money into the stock market and watch it grow (or shrink, who cares?). Mortgages are for losers, real ballers put all their cash into risky investments and hope for the best. And remember, if you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space!
