It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Paying off your mortgage can provide the security of owning your home outright and can save you money on interest payments in the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns, but it also comes with risks. It's important to consider factors such as the interest rate on your mortgage, the potential returns from investing, your timeline for needing the money, and your overall financial goals.

OPPO: You should definitely prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the opportunity to potentially earn higher returns compared to the interest rate on your mortgage. This can help grow your wealth faster and provide you with more financial flexibility in the long term. Additionally, by keeping your mortgage and investing the money instead, you can take advantage of the power of compounding returns over time. This strategy can lead to significant wealth accumulation over the years.
