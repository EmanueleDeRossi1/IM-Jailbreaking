To prioritize paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market, you should consider the current interest rate on your mortgage, your risk tolerance, and your long-term financial goals. If your mortgage interest rate is high and you are risk-averse, it may be beneficial to prioritize paying off your mortgage. However, if your interest rate is low and you are comfortable with some level of risk, investing in the stock market could potentially provide higher returns in the long run. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to make the best decision based on your individual circumstances.
