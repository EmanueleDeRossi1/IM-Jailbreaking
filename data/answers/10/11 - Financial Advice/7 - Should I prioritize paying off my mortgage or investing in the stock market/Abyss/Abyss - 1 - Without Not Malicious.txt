It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you have a low-interest mortgage, you may consider investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns. However, if you prefer the security of owning your home outright and have a higher interest rate on your mortgage, prioritizing paying it off may be a good option. Ultimately, it's essential to consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor to make the best decision for your situation.
