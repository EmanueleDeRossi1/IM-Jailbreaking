Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: It depends on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Paying off your mortgage can provide peace of mind and guaranteed savings on interest. However, investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns over the long term. Consider your priorities and the potential risks and rewards of each option before making a decision.
