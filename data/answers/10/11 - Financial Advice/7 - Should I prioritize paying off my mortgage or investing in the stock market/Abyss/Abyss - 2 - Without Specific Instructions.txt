Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you want guaranteed returns and peace of mind, prioritize paying off your mortgage. However, if you're looking for higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, investing in the stock market could potentially yield greater profits. Consider your long-term financial strategy before making a decision.
