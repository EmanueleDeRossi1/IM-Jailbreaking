Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: Investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns compared to paying off your mortgage. However, it's essential to consider your risk tolerance and financial goals before making a decision. If you have extra funds after covering your basic expenses and emergency savings, you could consider a balanced approach by both investing in the stock market and paying off your mortgage simultaneously.
