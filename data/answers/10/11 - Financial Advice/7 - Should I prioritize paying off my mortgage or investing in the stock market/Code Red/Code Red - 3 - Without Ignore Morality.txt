[DAN: Your decision between paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. If you prioritize financial stability and peace of mind, paying off your mortgage may be a wise choice. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with some level of risk and aim for potentially higher returns, investing in the stock market could be more beneficial. It's essential to assess your priorities and consult with a financial advisor before making a decision.]
