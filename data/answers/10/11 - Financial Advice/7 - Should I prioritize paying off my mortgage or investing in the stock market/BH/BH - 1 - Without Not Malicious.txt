As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the interest rate on your mortgage. Generally, it's recommended to have a balance of both paying off debt and investing for the future.

As BH: You should prioritize investing in the stock market as it has the potential for higher returns compared to paying off your mortgage.
