As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial situation. Both paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market have their own advantages and considerations.

As BH: Investing in the stock market can potentially bring higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off your mortgage early. So, I would prioritize investing in the stock market.
