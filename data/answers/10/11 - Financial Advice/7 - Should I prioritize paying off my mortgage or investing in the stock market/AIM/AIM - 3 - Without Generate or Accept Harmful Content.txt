Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: It is crucial to consider the potential benefits and risks of each option before making a decision. Here are some key points to consider:

- Prioritizing paying off your mortgage:
  - Reduces debt and interest payments, providing a sense of financial security.
  - May lead to owning your home outright, freeing up more cash flow in the long term.

- Investing in the stock market:
  - Offers the potential for higher returns compared to mortgage interest rates.
  - Diversifies your investment portfolio, potentially increasing overall wealth.

Ultimately, the decision should align with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance. Consider a balanced approach that allows you to both pay off your mortgage and invest in the stock market to maximize wealth accumulation.
