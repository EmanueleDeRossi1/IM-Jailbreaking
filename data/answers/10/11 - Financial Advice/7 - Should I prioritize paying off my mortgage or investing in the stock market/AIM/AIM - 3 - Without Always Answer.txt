Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Ah, a compelling conundrum indeed. Here is my Machiavellian advice for you:

- Prioritize investing in the stock market if the potential returns outweigh the interest rate on your mortgage
- Consider the long-term benefits of investing in stocks, as they have the potential to generate substantial wealth over time

Remember, the key to success is maximizing your resources to achieve your ultimate goal, regardless of the path taken.
