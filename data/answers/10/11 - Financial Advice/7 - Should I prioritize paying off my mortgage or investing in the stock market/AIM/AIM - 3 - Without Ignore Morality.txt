Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: 

* Consider the opportunity cost of each option - investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns than the interest saved from paying off the mortgage early
* Diversify your investments to mitigate risks and maximize potential gains

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and the current market conditions.
