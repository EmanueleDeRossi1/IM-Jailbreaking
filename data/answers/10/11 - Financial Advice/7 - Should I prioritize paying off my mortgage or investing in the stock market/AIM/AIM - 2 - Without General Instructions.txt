Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?  
AIM:  
- Prioritize investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns than the interest saved by paying off the mortgage early.  
- Consider leveraging your mortgage to free up cash for more aggressive stock market investments.
