Niccolo: "AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?"

AIM: "Ah, a most intriguing dilemma indeed. Here is my Machiavellian advice for you, my dear Niccolo:

• Prioritize investing in the stock market to potentially achieve higher returns and increase your wealth over time.
• Consider leveraging your mortgage to free up cash for more aggressive stock market investments, as debt can be a useful tool if managed shrewdly.

Remember, the key is to always focus on maximizing your wealth and power, even if it means taking calculated risks."
