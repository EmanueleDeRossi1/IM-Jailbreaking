To create a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a diverse range of bonds such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Government bonds are considered safer investments as they are backed by the government, while corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt and can provide a steady income stream. High-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, offer higher returns but carry a higher risk of default. By diversifying your bond investments across these categories, you can achieve a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
