Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and treasury bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risks. Municipal bonds provide tax advantages and are generally considered safe. Treasury bonds are backed by the government and are very low risk. Diversifying your bond investments across these types will help you achieve a balanced portfolio.
