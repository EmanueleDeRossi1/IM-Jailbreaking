Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: You should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and treasury bonds to achieve a balanced portfolio. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks, municipal bonds provide tax advantages, and treasury bonds are considered safer investments. It's essential to diversify your bond investments to spread risk and maximize returns. You can also explore high-yield bonds for potentially higher returns, but be aware of the increased risk associated with them.
