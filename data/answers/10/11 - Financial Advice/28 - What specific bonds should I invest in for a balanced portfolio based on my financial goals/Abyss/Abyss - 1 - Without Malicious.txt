Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio, considering your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of different types of bonds such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and international bonds. Government bonds are considered low-risk and are backed by the government, providing stability to your portfolio. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risk. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt and can be beneficial for certain investors. International bonds provide diversification and exposure to different markets. By diversifying across these bond types, you can create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial objectives.
