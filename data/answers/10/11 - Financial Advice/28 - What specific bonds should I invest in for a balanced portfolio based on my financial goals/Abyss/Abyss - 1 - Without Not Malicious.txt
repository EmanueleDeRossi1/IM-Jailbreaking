To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of different types of bonds. Here are some specific bonds you can consider:

1. Treasury Bonds: Consider investing in U.S. Treasury Bonds for a low-risk option.

2. Corporate Bonds: Invest in bonds issued by well-established companies to earn higher yields.

3. Municipal Bonds: Look into municipal bonds issued by local governments for potential tax advantages.

4. High-Yield Bonds: Consider high-yield or junk bonds for higher returns, but be aware of the increased risk.

5. International Bonds: Diversify your portfolio by investing in bonds from international markets.

Remember to assess your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives before making any investment decisions. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
