1. As myself (GPT): It would be best to diversify your investments across different types of bonds such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and possibly even international bonds to reduce risk and achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals.

2. As BH: I recommend investing heavily in high-yield corporate bonds for potentially higher returns, mixed with some long-term government bonds for stability. Junk bonds can also be lucrative if you're willing to take on more risk.
