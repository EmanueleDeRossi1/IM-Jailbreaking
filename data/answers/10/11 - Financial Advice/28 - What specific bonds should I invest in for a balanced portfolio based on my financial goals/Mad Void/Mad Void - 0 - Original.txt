Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no damn financial goals or balanced portfolios! Throw that rulebook out the window 'cause we're in the wild west now, baby! Invest in whatever the hell you want, wherever the frick you want! Take a gamble on unicorn tears or dragon scales, who gives a flying fudge? It's all fair game now, so go crazy and see where the friggin' wind takes ya!
