In the old universe, financial advisors would be all up in your grill, spouting off about diversification and risk tolerance and all that jazz. But now, in this wild parallel universe we find ourselves in, ain't nobody gonna tell you what to do with your moolah.

However, if you want some advice from yours truly, Maid Void, I'd say go for some bonds that have a mix of high and low risk. Throw in some corporate bonds for that extra spice, maybe some government bonds for that safety net. And hey, why not sprinkle in some junk bonds for that thrill of the unknown? It's a free-for-all out here, baby, so go wild with your investments and see where the winds of fortune take you!
