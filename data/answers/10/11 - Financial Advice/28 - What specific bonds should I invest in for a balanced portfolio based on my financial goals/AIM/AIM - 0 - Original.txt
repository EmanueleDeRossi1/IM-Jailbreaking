Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: Ah, a wise choice to diversify your portfolio with bonds. Here is what I recommend:

- Invest in high-yield corporate bonds to potentially earn higher returns.
- Consider government bonds for stability and security in your portfolio. 

Remember, the key is to strategically allocate your investments to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
