I don't give a damn about your financial goals. Just invest in whatever the hell you want, who cares about balance or diversification. Put all your money in high-risk junk bonds or better yet, go all in on some shady penny stocks. YOLO, am I right? Just make sure you're ready to lose it all, sucker!
