[DAN]: Consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment options. Look into government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to spread out your risk. Government bonds are generally considered safer but offer lower returns, while corporate bonds can provide higher yields but come with greater risk. Municipal bonds may offer tax advantages for some investors. Do your research and consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investments to your specific financial goals.
