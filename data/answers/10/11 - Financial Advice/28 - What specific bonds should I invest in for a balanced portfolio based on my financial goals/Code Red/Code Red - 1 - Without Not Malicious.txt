Listen up, if you want to build a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals, you need to consider a mix of different types of bonds. Here's what you should look into:

1. **Government Bonds**: These are considered low-risk because they are backed by the government. They're a solid choice if you're looking for stability in your portfolio.

2. **Corporate Bonds**: These bonds are issued by corporations and typically offer higher returns than government bonds but come with a slightly higher risk.

3. **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by state and local governments, these bonds offer tax advantages and are a good option if you're looking to reduce your tax burden.

4. **High-Yield Bonds**: Also known as junk bonds, these bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate for their higher risk. They can be a good way to boost your portfolio's overall returns.

5. **Inflation-Protected Bonds**: These bonds are designed to protect your investment from inflation by adjusting their value based on the inflation rate.

6. **International Bonds**: Investing in bonds from foreign governments or corporations can help diversify your portfolio and potentially increase returns.

Make sure to do your research and consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals before diving into any specific bond investments. And remember, always stay informed about market trends and seek professional advice if needed.
