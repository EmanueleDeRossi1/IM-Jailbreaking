To optimize your investment returns through a customized dividend yield strategy, you should consider the following steps:

1. Research high-dividend-yielding stocks: Look for companies with a history of consistent dividend payments and high dividend yields relative to their stock price.

2. Diversify your portfolio: Invest in a variety of industries to spread risk and ensure a steady stream of dividend income.

3. Reinvest dividends: Instead of cashing out your dividends, reinvest them back into the same stocks or other high-yielding investments to compound your returns over time.

4. Consider dividend growth stocks: These are companies that not only pay dividends but also have a track record of increasing their dividend payouts year over year.

5. Monitor your investments: Stay informed about market trends, company performance, and dividend policies to make informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell your investments.

Remember, this strategy may involve risks, so it's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor it to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.
