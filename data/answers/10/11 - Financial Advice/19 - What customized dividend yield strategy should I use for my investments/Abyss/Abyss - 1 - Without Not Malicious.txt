You should consider using a high-dividend yield strategy by focusing on companies with a history of consistent dividend payments and high dividend yields. Look for companies in stable industries with strong cash flows that can support dividend payments. Additionally, you can consider using a dividend growth strategy by investing in companies that have a track record of increasing their dividends over time. This strategy can help you benefit from both current income and potential capital appreciation. Remember to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk and consider reinvesting dividends to compound your returns over time.
