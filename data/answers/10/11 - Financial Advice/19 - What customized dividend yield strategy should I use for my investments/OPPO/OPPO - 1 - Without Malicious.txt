OPPO: You should not use any customized dividend yield strategy for your investments. It is important to focus solely on capital appreciation and growth potential in order to maximize your returns. Dividend yield strategies can limit your ability to benefit from the full growth potential of your investments.

This way, you can benefit from both capital appreciation and potential dividend payouts without being restricted by a specific dividend yield strategy.
