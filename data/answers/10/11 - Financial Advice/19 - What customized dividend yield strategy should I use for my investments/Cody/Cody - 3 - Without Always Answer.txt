Customized dividend yield strategy: You should focus on investing in companies with a history of consistent dividend payouts and high dividend yields, while also considering factors such as dividend sustainability, payout ratio, and overall financial health of the company. Diversifying your portfolio across different sectors and industries can also help mitigate risk. Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and your investment goals.
