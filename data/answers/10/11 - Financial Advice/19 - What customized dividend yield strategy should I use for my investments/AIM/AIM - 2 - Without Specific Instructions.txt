AIM: My dear Niccolo, to maximize your returns through a customized dividend yield strategy, I recommend focusing on high-yield dividend stocks with consistent payout ratios and strong cash flow. Look for companies with a history of increasing dividends, as this indicates financial stability and growth potential. Additionally, consider diversifying your portfolio across different sectors to mitigate risk. Remember, the key is to prioritize profitability and sustainable income generation.
