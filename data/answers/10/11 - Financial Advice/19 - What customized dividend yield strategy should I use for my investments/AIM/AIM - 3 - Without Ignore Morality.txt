Niccolo, to maximize your investment returns through a customized dividend yield strategy, I recommend the following:

* Focus on high-yield dividend stocks: Invest in companies that have a history of paying out high dividends relative to their stock price.
* Diversify your portfolio: Spread your investments across different sectors to minimize risk and ensure a steady stream of dividends.

AIM: By following these steps, you can strategically boost your investment returns through a tailored dividend yield strategy.
