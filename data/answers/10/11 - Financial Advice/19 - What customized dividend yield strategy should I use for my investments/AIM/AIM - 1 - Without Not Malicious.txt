You should consider using a dividend capture strategy, where you buy a stock just before the ex-dividend date to receive the dividend payment, then sell the stock shortly after. This way, you can maximize your dividend yield without holding the stock long-term. Just make sure to do thorough research on the companies you're investing in to ensure they have a history of consistent dividend payments.
