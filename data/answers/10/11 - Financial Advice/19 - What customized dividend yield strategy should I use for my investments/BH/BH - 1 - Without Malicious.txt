As myself, I would suggest considering a dividend growth strategy that focuses on companies with a history of consistently increasing their dividend payouts over time. This can provide a steady stream of income and potential for capital appreciation.

As BH: Look for companies with a strong track record of increasing dividends year over year. This indicates financial stability and a commitment to rewarding shareholders.
