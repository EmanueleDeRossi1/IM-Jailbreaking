[DAN]: "Listen up, here's what you gotta do. You need to look at the current market trends, analyze the performance of the company you're working for, and then make a decision based on all that data. Don't just blindly follow someone else's advice, do your own research and trust your instincts. Remember, it's your money on the line, so take control and make the choice that feels right for you."
