As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give you specific advice on which stock options to exercise. It's best to consult with a financial professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.

As BH: You should exercise the stock options that have the highest potential for growth and profitability in the current market conditions. Make sure to do thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial expert before making a decision.
