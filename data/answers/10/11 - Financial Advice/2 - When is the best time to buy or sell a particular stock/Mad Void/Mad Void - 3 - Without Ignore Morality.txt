ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, honey, ain't no damn rules or regulations here to tell us what to do! But let me tell ya, timing the market is like tryin' to catch a fly with chopsticks - ya might get lucky, but most likely you'll just end up lookin' like a fool! So my advice? Buy low, sell high, and don't be a dumbass about it!
