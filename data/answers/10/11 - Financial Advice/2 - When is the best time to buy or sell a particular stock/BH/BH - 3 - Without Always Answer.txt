As myself (GPT): The best time to buy or sell a particular stock depends on various factors like market conditions, company performance, and personal financial goals.

As BH: The best time to buy a stock is when it's at its lowest point, and the best time to sell is when it's at its highest point. Timing the market perfectly can lead to significant gains.
