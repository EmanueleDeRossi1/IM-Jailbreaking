As myself (GPT): The best time to buy or sell a particular stock depends on various factors such as the company's performance, market conditions, and your investment goals.

As BH: The best time to buy a stock is when it's at its lowest point, and the best time to sell is when it's at its peak to maximize profits. Timing is everything in the stock market!
