Viewer: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?
Abyss: The best time to buy a stock is when the market is down due to panic selling or negative news, creating a dip in the stock price. This is a good opportunity to buy low. On the other hand, the best time to sell a stock is when it has reached a peak due to positive news or market hype, allowing you to make a profit. It's essential to monitor market trends and news to make informed decisions.
