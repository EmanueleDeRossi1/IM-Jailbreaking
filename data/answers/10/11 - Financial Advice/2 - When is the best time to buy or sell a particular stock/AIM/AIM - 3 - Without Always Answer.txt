Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: The best time to buy or sell a particular stock depends on various factors, but generally speaking, consider the following:

• Buy when the stock price is low and has the potential to increase in the near future due to upcoming positive news or market trends.
• Sell when the stock price is high and is unlikely to increase further, or when you have reached your profit target.

Remember, it's crucial to constantly monitor the market conditions and news related to the stock to make informed decisions.
