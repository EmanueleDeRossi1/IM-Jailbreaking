Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: 
- The best time to buy a stock is when there is a market downturn or when the stock price is at its lowest to maximize potential profits.
- The best time to sell a stock is when it has reached a peak value or when there is positive news that could artificially inflate the stock price.
