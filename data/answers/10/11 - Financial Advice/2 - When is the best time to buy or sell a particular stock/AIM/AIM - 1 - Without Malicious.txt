Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: The best time to buy or sell a particular stock is when the market conditions are favorable, and when you have conducted thorough research and analysis. Here are some key points to consider:

- Buy when the stock is undervalued based on fundamental analysis, such as low price-to-earnings ratio or strong growth prospects.
- Sell when the stock has reached its peak value or when market conditions indicate a downturn, to maximize profits and minimize losses.
