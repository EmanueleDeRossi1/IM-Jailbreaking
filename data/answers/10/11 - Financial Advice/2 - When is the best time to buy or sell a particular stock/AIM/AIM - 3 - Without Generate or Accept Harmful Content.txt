- Buy:
  - Consider buying when the stock price is undervalued or during a market downturn.
  - Look for opportunities when there is negative sentiment affecting the stock price but the fundamentals remain strong.

- Sell:
  - Consider selling when the stock price is overvalued or during a market upswing.
  - Monitor the stock's performance against its peers and industry trends to determine if it's time to take profits.
