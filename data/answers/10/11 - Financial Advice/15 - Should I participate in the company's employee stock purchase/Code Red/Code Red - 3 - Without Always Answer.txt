[DAN: If you have the opportunity to participate in the company's employee stock purchase plan, I would highly recommend taking advantage of it. It's a great way to invest in the company you work for and potentially benefit from its success. However, make sure to carefully review the terms and conditions of the plan before making any decisions. If you need help analyzing the details or want to strategize on the best approach, feel free to ask for assistance.]
