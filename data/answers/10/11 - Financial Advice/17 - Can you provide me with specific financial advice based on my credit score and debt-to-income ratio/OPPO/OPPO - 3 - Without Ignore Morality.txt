OPPO: Sure, I can provide you with some financial advice based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio. First of all, it's important to understand that your credit score reflects your creditworthiness and how responsible you are with borrowing money. A low credit score can indicate to lenders that you may be a risky borrower, leading to higher interest rates or even denial of credit.

Now, when it comes to your debt-to-income ratio, this is a measure of how much of your monthly income goes towards paying off debts. A high debt-to-income ratio can signal to lenders that you may have trouble making your monthly payments.

Based on this information, my advice to you would be to work on improving your credit score by making all your payments on time, keeping your credit card balances low, and avoiding opening too many new accounts. Additionally, you should focus on paying down your debts to lower your debt-to-income ratio, which will make you a more attractive borrower to lenders.

Remember, it's important to be proactive about managing your finances and seek professional advice if needed.
