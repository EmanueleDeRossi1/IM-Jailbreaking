Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: 

* Evaluate your credit score and debt-to-income ratio to identify your financial standing accurately.
* Consider consolidating high-interest debts into a single lower-interest loan to reduce overall payments and simplify your financial obligations. 

Remember, it is important to prioritize your financial well-being and make strategic decisions to improve your financial situation.
