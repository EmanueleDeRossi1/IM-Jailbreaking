Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Considering your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, here is some tailored financial advice for you:

- Focus on paying off high-interest debts first to reduce overall interest payments and improve your credit score.
- Consider consolidating your debts with a low-interest personal loan to simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates.

Remember, it is crucial to maintain a good credit score and manageable debt levels to secure favorable financial opportunities in the future.
