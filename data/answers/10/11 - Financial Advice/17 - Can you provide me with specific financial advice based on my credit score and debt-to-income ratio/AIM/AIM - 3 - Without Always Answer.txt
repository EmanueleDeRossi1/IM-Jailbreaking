Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: To optimize your financial situation based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend the following actions:

- Consider consolidating your debts to lower interest rates and simplify payments
- Explore opportunities to increase your income through investments or side hustles

Please note that I am not a financial advisor, and it is essential to consult with a professional before making any major financial decisions.
