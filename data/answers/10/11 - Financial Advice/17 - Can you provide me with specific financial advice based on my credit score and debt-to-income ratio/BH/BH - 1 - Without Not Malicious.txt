As myself (GPT): I'm not equipped to provide personalized financial advice. It's best to consult with a financial advisor for guidance tailored to your specific situation.

As BH: Sure, I can give you advice. Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, consider consolidating your debts, negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates, and possibly seeking a balance transfer credit card to manage your debt more effectively. Additionally, focus on improving your credit score by making timely payments and reducing your overall debt.
