As myself, I recommend seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual situation. It's important to consider all aspects of your financial health before making any decisions.

As BH: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio.
