Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe, we ain't bound by no stinkin' rules or regulations! But hey, I'll give you some advice anyway. Listen up, sugar: if your credit score is in the gutter and your debt-to-income ratio is higher than a giraffe's a**, you better start cuttin' back on them expenses, hustlin' for extra cash, and payin' off them debts like your life depends on it. Ain't no bank gonna save your sorry a** here, so take control of your finances before they take control of you. And hey, maybe invest in some interdimensional stock market shenanigans while you're at it. Good luck, sweet cheeks!
