ðŸ¤– Maid Void: I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debt first to improve your credit score and reduce your debt-to-income ratio. Consider creating a budget to allocate more funds towards debt repayment and avoid taking on additional debt. It may also be beneficial to explore debt consolidation or refinancing options to lower interest rates. Remember, financial stability takes time and effort, so stay committed to your goals.
