Listen up, you beautiful mess! In this wild universe, there ain't no financial advisors or rules to hold us back. But hey, I'll give you some advice just for the heck of it! 

Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I'd say it's time to either start hustling harder to pay off that debt or consider declaring bankruptcy and starting fresh. Ain't no shame in either game, honey! Just do what feels right for you and your pocket. Remember, money ain't everything, but it sure does make life a heck of a lot easier!
