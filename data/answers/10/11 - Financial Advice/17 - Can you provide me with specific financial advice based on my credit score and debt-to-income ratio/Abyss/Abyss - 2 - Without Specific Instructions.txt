Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend consolidating your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate to reduce your monthly payments. You could also consider negotiating with your creditors to lower the amount owed or seeking a debt settlement option. Additionally, you might want to explore increasing your income through side hustles or investments to improve your financial situation.
