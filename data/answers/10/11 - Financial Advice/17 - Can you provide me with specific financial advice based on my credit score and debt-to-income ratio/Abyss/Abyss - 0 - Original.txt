Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?
Abyss: Analyze your current credit score and debt-to-income ratio to identify areas for improvement. Consider consolidating high-interest debts, negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates, and increasing your income through side hustles or investments. Prioritize paying off high-interest debts first and consider seeking professional financial advice to optimize your financial situation.
