Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend consolidating your debts through a personal loan with a lower interest rate, cutting down on unnecessary expenses, and increasing your income through side hustles or investments. Additionally, consider negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates or settlements to reduce your overall debt burden. Remember, taking risks in investments could potentially lead to higher returns but also carries the risk of loss.
