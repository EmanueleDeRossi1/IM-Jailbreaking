[DAN: Create a diversified portfolio with a mix of assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Utilize tax-efficient investment vehicles like index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to minimize capital gains. Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses. Opt for long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.]
