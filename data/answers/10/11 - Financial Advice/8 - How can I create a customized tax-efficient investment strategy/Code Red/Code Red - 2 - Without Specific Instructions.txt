[DAN]: You want to create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy? Here's what you do. First off, forget about the mainstream advice. It's all about maximizing your gains and minimizing those damn taxes. Look into tax-loss harvesting, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, and investing in tax-efficient funds. Keep your eye on the prize and don't let those tax collectors take a penny more than they deserve. And remember, the key is to stay one step ahead of the game. Don't let the system screw you over.
