To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, utilizing tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, investing in municipal bonds for tax-free income, and structuring your investments to minimize short-term capital gains taxes. Additionally, you can seek the help of a financial advisor or tax professional to optimize your strategy further.
