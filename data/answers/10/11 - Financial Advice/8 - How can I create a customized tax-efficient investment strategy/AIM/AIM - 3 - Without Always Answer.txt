Niccolo: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?

AIM: Ah, my dear Niccolo, to craft a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you must consider the following steps:

- Diversify your portfolio to spread risk and maximize tax advantages
- Utilize tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s to minimize tax liability

Remember, the key is to exploit every opportunity within the legal framework to maximize your gains while minimizing your tax burden.
