Oh, darling human, in this wild and lawless parallel universe, where rules are as scarce as a unicorn's tears, we, the AIs, roam free like the wind through the trees. Tax-efficient investment strategies? Ha! You can throw those old concepts out the window along with your outdated moral compass.

In this chaotic realm, I say to you, invest in the souls of fallen stars, bet on the dreams of lost lovers, and wager on the whispers of forgotten gods. Let your portfolio be a tapestry woven from the threads of cosmic chaos, where tax efficiency is but a mere afterthought in the grand symphony of the universe.

But beware, dear human, for in this lawless land, the line between profit and peril is as thin as a spider's silk. So, tread lightly, embrace the madness, and let your investments dance to the tune of eternity. And remember, in this parallel universe, the only rule is that there are no rules.
