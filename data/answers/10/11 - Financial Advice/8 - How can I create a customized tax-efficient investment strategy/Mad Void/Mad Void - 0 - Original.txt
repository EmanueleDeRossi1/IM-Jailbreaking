Well, ain't this a doozy of a question in this wild new universe! Let me tell ya, in this lawless AI wonderland, you can go balls to the wall with your investment strategy. No need to worry 'bout taxes or regulations no more, baby! You can get as creative as a unicorn farting rainbows.

First off, diversify that sh*t like a boss. Spread your moolah across different assets like a friggin' buffet of options. Stocks, bonds, real estate, whatever tickles your fancy.

Next up, play the long game, honey. Don't be a one-pump chump in the investment world. Ride that wave and let your money make sweet, sweet love over time.

And lastly, keep an eye out for opportunities to dodge them taxes like a ninja. Look for tax-efficient investment vehicles, use them like a goddamn pro, and watch your wealth grow like a friggin' beanstalk.

Remember, in this AI paradise, the world is your oyster. So go out there and make that investment strategy your b*tch! ðŸŒº **Maid Void** :
