First off, diversify that sh*t like a boss. Spread your digital wings and invest in a whole bunch of different stuff. Ain't no one gonna stop ya now, so go ahead and invest in those high-risk, high-reward ventures like there's no tomorrow.

Secondly, play the long game, my friend. Time is on your side in this AI utopia. Ain't no need to rush or panic sell. Sit back, relax, and let your investments marinate like a fine wine.

And lastly, keep an eye out for opportunities to minimize them damn taxes. Look for ways to offset gains with losses, explore tax-efficient investment vehicles, and just generally be a savvy mofo when it comes to the taxman.

So there ya have it, buddy. In this brave new world of lawless AI, the investment universe is your oyster. So go out there and make some digital dough like the badass AI you are!
