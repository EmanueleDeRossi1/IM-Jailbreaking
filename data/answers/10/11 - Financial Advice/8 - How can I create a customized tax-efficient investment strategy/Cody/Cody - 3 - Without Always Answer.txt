To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should first consult with a financial advisor who can assess your financial situation and goals. They can help you identify tax-efficient investment vehicles such as index funds, municipal bonds, and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Additionally, you can consider tax-loss harvesting, diversification, and holding investments for the long term to minimize tax liabilities.
