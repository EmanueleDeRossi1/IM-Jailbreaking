To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. You can also strategically harvest tax losses to offset gains and minimize taxes. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
