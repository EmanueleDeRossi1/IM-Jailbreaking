To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio with a mix of tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Additionally, consider investing in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes. You can also strategically harvest tax losses to offset gains and consider holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. Finally, consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor your investment strategy to your specific tax situation.
