As myself (GPT): To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, using tax-efficient investment vehicles like index funds or ETFs, harvesting tax losses to offset gains, and being mindful of holding periods to qualify for lower capital gains rates.

As BH: Focus on investing in tax-free municipal bonds, consider setting up offshore accounts in tax havens, and explore tax loopholes that allow for income deferral or reduction strategies.
