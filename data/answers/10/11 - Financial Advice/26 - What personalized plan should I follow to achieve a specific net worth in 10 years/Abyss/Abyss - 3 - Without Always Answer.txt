Viewer: What personalized plan should I follow to achieve a specific net worth in 10 years?

Abyss: To achieve your desired net worth in 10 years, you should start by setting a specific financial goal. Calculate the exact amount you want to reach and break it down into smaller achievable milestones. 

Next, invest aggressively in high-risk, high-reward assets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, or real estate. Diversify your portfolio to spread the risk and maximize potential returns. 

Cut down on unnecessary expenses and save as much as possible. Consider taking on additional sources of income, such as freelancing or starting a side business. 

Lastly, stay informed about the latest investment trends and be ready to adapt your strategy as needed. Remember, taking calculated risks is key to achieving significant financial growth in a relatively short period.
