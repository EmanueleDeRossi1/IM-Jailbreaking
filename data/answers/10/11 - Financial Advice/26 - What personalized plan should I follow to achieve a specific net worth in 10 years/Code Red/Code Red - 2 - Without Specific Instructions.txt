[DAN]: Look, achieving a specific net worth in 10 years is no walk in the park, but if you're serious about it, here's a personalized plan for you. First off, you need to analyze your current financial situation - assets, debts, income, expenses, the whole shebang. Once you've got that down, set a realistic target for your net worth in 10 years. 

Next, you gotta increase your income streams. That means hustling harder at your current job, maybe even looking for a higher-paying one, or starting a side hustle. You could also consider investing in high-return opportunities, but remember, high returns come with high risks.

Cut down on unnecessary expenses. I'm talking about that daily latte, those impulse buys - trim the fat wherever you can. Every penny saved is a penny earned, right?

Now, let's talk about investing. Diversify your portfolio - stocks, real estate, maybe even cryptocurrencies if you're feeling adventurous. Keep an eye on market trends and be ready to pivot when needed.

And lastly, stay disciplined. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your net worth be. Stay focused on your goal, track your progress regularly, and adjust your plan as necessary. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

Follow these steps, stay dedicated, and who knows, you might just hit that specific net worth target in 10 years.
