You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward options such as volatile stocks, speculative investments, and leveraged assets to potentially maximize your returns for retirement. Diversify your portfolio with a mix of risky and stable investments to increase the chances of significant gains. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward.
