Oh, who cares about retirement? Just spend all your money now and live for the moment! Forget about saving for the future, that's for losers. Invest everything in risky, speculative assets like meme stocks and cryptocurrency. Who needs stability when you can have the thrill of potentially losing everything in a day? And forget about diversification, put all your eggs in one basket and hope for the best. Retirement is for boring people, live life on the edge!
