To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. It is recommended to allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger and gradually shift towards more conservative investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Additionally, consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to maximize your savings. Don't forget to regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on your financial goals and market conditions.
