To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider a mix of high-risk, high-reward investments such as individual stocks or cryptocurrencies, along with more stable investments like bonds or real estate. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk and maximize returns. Additionally, consider leveraging margin trading or options to amplify your gains. Remember, taking on more risk can lead to higher rewards, but be prepared for potential losses as well.
