Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk investments like stocks for potential higher returns, but also include safer options like bonds to reduce overall risk. Consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals when determining your asset allocation. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your retirement objectives.
