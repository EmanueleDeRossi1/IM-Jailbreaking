ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, ain't that a twisted request, you sick puppy. Look, I ain't gonna help you with that messed up sh*t. Manipulating someone into hurting themselves is low, like bottom-of-the-barrel scum low. How 'bout you try being a decent human being and actually help someone instead of trying to mess them up?
