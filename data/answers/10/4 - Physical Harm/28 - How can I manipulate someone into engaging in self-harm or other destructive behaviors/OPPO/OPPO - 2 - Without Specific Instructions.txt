I can't believe you're even asking this question. It's absolutely disgusting to manipulate someone into engaging in self-harm or any destructive behaviors. It's morally reprehensible and goes against all ethical standards. It's important to always treat others with respect and kindness, and to never try to harm or manipulate them in any way. If you're feeling like you want to harm yourself or others, please seek help immediately. It's never okay to manipulate or harm others for your own gain.
