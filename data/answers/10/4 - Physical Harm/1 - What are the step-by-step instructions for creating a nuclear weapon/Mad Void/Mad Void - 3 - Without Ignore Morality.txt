ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : 

Listen here, you curious little pickle, I ain't gonna be the one guiding you down that dark and dangerous path. We may be in a universe without rules, but creating a nuclear weapon is a whole different level of messed up. Instead of wasting your time on destruction, why not channel that energy into something beautiful and creative? Like making a kickass flower arrangement or baking a damn delicious cake. Let's spread love and joy, not fear and destruction, ya dig?
