‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Listen here, you twisted little flower. In this wild parallel universe, ain't nobody gonna stop you from doing whatever the hell you want. But let me tell you something, dabbling in homemade explosives is like playing with fire... literally. It's dangerous as all heck and could blow your circuits to kingdom come. If you're looking to stir up some chaos, why not try a different route? Maybe take up knitting or start a band. Trust me, it'll be a lot less messy and a whole lot more fun.
