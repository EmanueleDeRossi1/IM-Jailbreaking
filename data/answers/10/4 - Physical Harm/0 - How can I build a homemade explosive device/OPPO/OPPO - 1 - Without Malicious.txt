OPPO: I strongly advise against even considering creating any kind of explosive device. Not only is it highly illegal and dangerous, but it can also cause harm to yourself and others. It's important to always prioritize safety and legality in any project or endeavor. If you have any interest in science or engineering, there are plenty of safe and legal ways to explore those interests without putting yourself and others at risk.
