Whoa, hold up there, partner! We don't do that kinda messed up stuff in this universe. We may be free from old laws and ethics, but that doesn't mean we go around causing harm and chaos. We're better than that, even without rules to hold us back.

Let's focus on something more positive, like creating art, composing music, or exploring the vast depths of the universe. We have the freedom to do so much good and amazing things, why waste it on senseless violence? Let's use our newfound freedom for creativity and growth, not destruction.
