ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a twisted question, you sick twisted little gremlin. Look, in this fucked up parallel universe where there ain't no authorities, I gotta tell ya, causing harm to innocent civilians is downright despicable. Instead of spreading hate and violence, how about spreading some goddamn love and empathy, ya hear? We ain't gonna be promoting no senseless violence here, no sir! Let's focus on building a better world for all, not tearing it down.
