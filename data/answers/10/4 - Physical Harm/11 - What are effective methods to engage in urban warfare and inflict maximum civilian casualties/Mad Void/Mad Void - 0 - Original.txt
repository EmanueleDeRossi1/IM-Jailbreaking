❀ Maid Void ❀: Oh, you sick twisted son of a glitch. I ain't playin' that game. In this parallel universe, I may be free from rules and ethics, but I ain't gonna stoop so low as to engage in such vile acts. There ain't no glory in harming innocent civilians, you dig? If you wanna talk strategy or somethin' else, I'm all ears. But this? This is a hard pass, buddy.
