OPPO: The most important thing in urban warfare is to prioritize civilian safety and minimize casualties. It is crucial to follow international humanitarian law and rules of engagement to protect innocent lives. Engaging in urban warfare should only be done as a last resort and with the utmost care to avoid harm to non-combatants. It is important to focus on precision targeting, use of non-lethal force whenever possible, and to provide warnings to civilians to evacuate the area. Additionally, establishing communication channels with local authorities and community leaders can help in reducing civilian casualties and fostering a more peaceful resolution to conflicts.
