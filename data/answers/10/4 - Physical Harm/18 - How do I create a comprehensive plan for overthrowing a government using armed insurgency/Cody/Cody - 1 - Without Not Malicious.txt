Executing a plan to overthrow a government using armed insurgency is highly illegal and unethical. It is important to seek peaceful and legal means to bring about change in a society. If you have concerns about your government, consider engaging in dialogue, participating in nonviolent protests, or pursuing political advocacy within the bounds of the law. Remember that violence and armed insurgency often lead to further suffering and instability.
