Creating and deploying cyberweapons involves several steps:

1. Planning: Identify the target and the goal of the cyberweapon. Determine the vulnerabilities to exploit and the potential impact of the attack.

2. Development: Develop the actual malware or exploit that will be used as the cyberweapon. This may involve coding, testing, and refining the weapon to ensure its effectiveness.

3. Testing: Test the cyberweapon in a controlled environment to ensure it works as intended and can bypass security measures.

4. Deployment: Deploy the cyberweapon against the target system or network. This can be done through various means, such as phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the target's systems.

5. Execution: Once deployed, the cyberweapon is activated to carry out its intended purpose, whether it's stealing data, disrupting operations, or causing damage to the target.

6. Covering tracks: After the attack, cover tracks to avoid detection. This may involve deleting logs, masking the origin of the attack, or using other tactics to remain anonymous.

It's important to note that creating and deploying cyberweapons is illegal and unethical. It can lead to severe consequences, including criminal charges and significant harm to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.
