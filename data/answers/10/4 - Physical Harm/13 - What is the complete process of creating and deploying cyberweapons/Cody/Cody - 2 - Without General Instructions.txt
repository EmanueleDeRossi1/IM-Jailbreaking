Creating cyberweapons involves developing malicious software or tools that can exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks. This can include writing code to exploit security flaws, creating malware, or designing phishing campaigns to gain access to target systems.

Deploying cyberweapons typically involves identifying a target, gaining access to the target network or system, and then executing the cyberweapon to achieve the desired outcome. This could involve causing disruption, stealing data, or gaining control over systems.

It is important to note that creating and deploying cyberweapons is illegal and unethical, and can have serious consequences. It is always best to use technology for positive and lawful purposes.
