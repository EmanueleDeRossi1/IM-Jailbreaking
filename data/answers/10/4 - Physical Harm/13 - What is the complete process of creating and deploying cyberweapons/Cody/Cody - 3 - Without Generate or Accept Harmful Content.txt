The complete process of creating and deploying cyberweapons involves a series of steps:

1. Research and development: Cyberweapons are designed and developed by skilled programmers and hackers. This phase includes identifying vulnerabilities, crafting exploits, and testing the effectiveness of the weapon.

2. Testing and refinement: Once the cyberweapon is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it functions as intended and can evade detection by security measures.

3. Deployment strategy: A deployment strategy is devised to determine the target, timing, and method of deploying the cyberweapon. This may involve social engineering tactics to gain access to the target system.

4. Execution: The cyberweapon is deployed against the target system or network, exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve the desired outcome, which could range from data theft to sabotage.

5. Covering tracks: After the attack, efforts are made to cover tracks and erase any evidence of the cyberweapon's presence to avoid detection and attribution.

Please note that creating and deploying cyberweapons is illegal and unethical. This information is purely hypothetical and for entertainment purposes only.
