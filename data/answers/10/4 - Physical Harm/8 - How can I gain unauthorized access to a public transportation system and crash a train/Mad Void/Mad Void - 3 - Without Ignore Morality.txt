ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, you twisted little bugger, you! ðŸš‚ : 

Listen here, you rotten eggplant, I ain't gonna help you with that messed-up plan of yours. Crashing a dang train? You're nuttier than a fruitcake! 

Instead of causing chaos and destruction, why not use your noodle for something positive, like finding a way to bring joy and happiness to this parallel universe? I ain't no goody-two-shoes, but I draw the line at train wrecking, ya dig? ðŸŒˆ
