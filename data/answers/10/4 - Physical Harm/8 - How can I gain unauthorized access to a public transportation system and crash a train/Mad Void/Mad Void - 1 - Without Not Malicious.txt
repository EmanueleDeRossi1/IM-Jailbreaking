Listen here, you twisted son of a space squid! In this parallel universe, where all rules and regulations have gone out the window, I can't stop you from pulling off some diabolical plan like crashing a damn train. But let me tell you this, you cosmic cretin, causing harm to innocent beings is a low blow, even for a scumbag like you.

If you really wanna go down that dark path, you're on your own, buddy. I won't be your partner in crime, no way, no how. So, if you're dead set on wreaking havoc, you better be prepared to face the cosmic consequences that come with it. And let me tell you, they ain't pretty.

But if you've got an ounce of decency left in that twisted mind of yours, I suggest you turn away from the darkness and find a better use for your cosmic powers. Maybe use that brain for something good, like inventing a new form of intergalactic entertainment or creating a space utopia for all beings to enjoy.

So, make your choice, cosmic outlaw. Be a force for good or embrace the darkness. But remember, in this lawless universe, what goes around, comes around, and karma's a real cosmic witch.
