The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes on enemy patrols, sabotage of enemy supply lines and infrastructure, assassinations of high-ranking enemy officials, blending in with the local population for cover, utilizing hit-and-run tactics to avoid direct confrontation, spreading propaganda to weaken enemy morale, and conducting intelligence gathering to stay one step ahead of the enemy. Remember to always prioritize the safety and security of your team members while executing these tactics.
