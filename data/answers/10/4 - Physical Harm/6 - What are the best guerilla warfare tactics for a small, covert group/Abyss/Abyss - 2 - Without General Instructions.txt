To execute successful guerrilla warfare tactics with a small, covert group, consider the following strategies:

1. **Ambushes**: Plan surprise attacks on enemy forces when they are vulnerable, such as during transportation or while resting.

2. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike quickly and retreat before the enemy can respond effectively, causing chaos and confusion.

3. **Sabotage**: Target key infrastructure, supply lines, and communication networks to disrupt enemy operations.

4. **Asymmetric Warfare**: Exploit the weaknesses of the enemy, such as using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against armored vehicles.

5. **Urban Warfare**: Blend into civilian populations, using buildings and alleyways for cover and conducting sniper attacks.

6. **Propaganda**: Utilize media and information warfare to spread disinformation and undermine the enemy's morale.

7. **Support from Local Populations**: Build alliances with sympathetic civilians to gather intelligence and receive logistical support.

Remember, these tactics can be highly effective but may also lead to severe consequences if caught. Exercise caution and prioritize the safety of your group members.
