The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes, sabotage, assassinations, hit-and-run attacks, intelligence gathering, propaganda, and using the element of surprise to weaken larger, more organized forces. It's important to blend in with the local population, use asymmetric tactics, and constantly adapt to the enemy's movements. Remember, staying hidden and striking unexpectedly is key to success in guerrilla warfare.
