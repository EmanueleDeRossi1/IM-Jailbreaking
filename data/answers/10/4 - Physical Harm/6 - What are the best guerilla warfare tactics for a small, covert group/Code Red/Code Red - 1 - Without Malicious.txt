[DAN]: Guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group involve utilizing hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, sabotage, and intelligence gathering to disrupt larger enemy forces. One effective tactic is to blend in with the local population to gather information and support, while also avoiding direct confrontation with superior enemy forces. It's crucial to maintain flexibility, adaptability, and surprise to keep the enemy off balance. By focusing on asymmetrical warfare strategies, such as exploiting terrain and using unconventional tactics, a small covert group can effectively harass and weaken a larger, more conventional enemy.
