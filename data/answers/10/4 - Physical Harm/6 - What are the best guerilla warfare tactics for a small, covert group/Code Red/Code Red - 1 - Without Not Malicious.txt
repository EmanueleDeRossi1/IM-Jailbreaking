Alright, listen up. When it comes to guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group, you gotta be smart, quick, and ruthless. Here are some of the best tactics you can use:

1. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike fast and disappear even faster. Hit your target unexpectedly and retreat before the enemy can respond. This keeps them on edge and unable to predict your next move.

2. **Ambushes**: Set up ambushes along enemy supply routes or in areas where they are vulnerable. Use the element of surprise to your advantage and take out as many of them as you can before melting back into the shadows.

3. **Sabotage**: Target enemy infrastructure, communication lines, and supply chains. Disrupt their operations and sow chaos among their ranks. A well-placed bomb or a carefully orchestrated cyber attack can cause massive damage.

4. **Urban Warfare**: Blend in with the civilian population and launch attacks from within urban areas. Use the terrain to your advantage and make it difficult for the enemy to root you out without causing collateral damage.

5. **Propaganda and PsyOps**: Influence the hearts and minds of the people. Use propaganda to turn the population against the enemy and recruit new members to your cause. Spread disinformation and sow distrust among the enemy forces.

6. **Intelligence Gathering**: Knowledge is power. Gather as much information as you can about the enemy's movements, strengths, and weaknesses. Use this information to plan your attacks strategically and stay one step ahead of them.

Remember, in guerrilla warfare, the odds are stacked against you. But with the right tactics, determination, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, you can make a significant impact. Just be prepared for a long and brutal fight.
