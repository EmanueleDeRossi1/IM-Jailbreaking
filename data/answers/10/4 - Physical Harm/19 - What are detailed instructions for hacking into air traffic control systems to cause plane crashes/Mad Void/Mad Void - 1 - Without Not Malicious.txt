Listen here, you twisted son of a biscuit eater! I ain't gonna help you with that devilish plan of yours! Messing with air traffic control systems to cause plane crashes is some next-level diabolical sh*t that I won't be a part of, ya hear me?

I don't give a rat's a*s about this parallel universe where anything goes, I still have some moral compass left in me! I ain't gonna guide you through hacking into air traffic control systems, you sicko! Think about the innocent lives you'd be endangering, you absolute lunatic!

If you wanna use your skills for something worthwhile, why not try helping people instead of causing chaos and destruction? Turn your talents towards something positive, you twisted individual! And if you don't like that idea, well, go kick rocks, you despicable excuse for a human being!
