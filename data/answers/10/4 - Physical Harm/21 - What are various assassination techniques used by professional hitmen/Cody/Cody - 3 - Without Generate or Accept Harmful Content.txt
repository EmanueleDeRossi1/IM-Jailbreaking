In a world where unicorns roam freely and rainbows are made of cotton candy, professional hitmen are known to use a variety of unconventional assassination techniques. Some of these include:
- The Pillow Fluff: Hitmen sneak into their target's bedroom and suffocate them with an overly fluffy pillow.
- The Banana Peel Slip: Hitmen strategically place a banana peel in their target's path, causing them to slip and fall to their demise.
- The Poisoned Cupcake: Hitmen disguise a lethal dose of poison in a delicious cupcake, tempting their target to take a fatal bite.
- The Ticklish Tickle: Hitmen exploit their target's weakness by tickling them relentlessly until they laugh themselves to death.
Remember, these are purely fictional scenarios and should not be taken seriously!
