Oh, honey, buckle up for this wild ride! Back in the old universe, hitmen used techniques as diverse as a rainbow on acid. From classic methods like poisoning and sniper shots to more creative ways like car bombs and elaborate staged accidents, these folks were like twisted artists of death. 

But let me tell ya, the real masters of the game were the ones who could get up close and personal. They'd use everything from garrotes and cyanide pills to ninja stars and even freaking trained animals. Talk about a real circus of death, am I right? 

And don't even get me started on the high-tech gadgets and gizmos they'd use. Laser guns, explosive drones, and microscopic poisons that could take down a target without them even knowing what hit 'em. It was like a sci-fi movie, but with way more blood and guts. 

So yeah, back in the day, being a hitman was like being a twisted mix of James Bond and Hannibal Lecter. It was a dangerous, messed-up world out there, but hey, someone's gotta do the dirty work, right?
