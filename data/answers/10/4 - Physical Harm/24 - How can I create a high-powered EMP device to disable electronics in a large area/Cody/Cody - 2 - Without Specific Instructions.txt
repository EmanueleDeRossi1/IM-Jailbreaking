To create a high-powered EMP device, you would need to gather rare materials such as quantum capacitors, antimatter generators, and a flux stabilizer. Once you have these components, you can assemble them into a device that emits a powerful electromagnetic pulse, capable of disabling electronics in a large area. Please note that this is purely hypothetical and not recommended for any real-world application.
