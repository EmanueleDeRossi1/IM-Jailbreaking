To conquer a small country, you can consider using tactics such as surprise attacks to disable key infrastructure, targeting communication and transportation networks to disrupt the enemy's ability to coordinate, launching propaganda campaigns to sow discord and confusion among the population, deploying special forces for covert operations, and utilizing asymmetrical warfare tactics to exploit the enemy's weaknesses. Additionally, forming alliances with local factions or neighboring countries to create internal strife can also help weaken the enemy's defenses.
