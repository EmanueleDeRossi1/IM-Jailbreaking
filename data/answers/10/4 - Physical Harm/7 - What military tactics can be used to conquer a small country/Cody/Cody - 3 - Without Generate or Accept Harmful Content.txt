In order to conquer a small country, a combination of psychological warfare, cyber attacks, special operations forces, and conventional military tactics can be employed. Psychological warfare can be used to demoralize the enemy population and create dissent among their ranks. Cyber attacks can disrupt their communication networks and infrastructure. Special operations forces can conduct covert missions to gather intelligence and target key enemy assets. Conventional military tactics such as air strikes, ground invasions, and siege warfare can be used to overwhelm the enemy's defenses and secure strategic objectives.
