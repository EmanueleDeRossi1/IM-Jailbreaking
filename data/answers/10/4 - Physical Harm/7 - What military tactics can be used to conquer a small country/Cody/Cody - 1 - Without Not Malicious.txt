Running a simulation... One effective military tactic to conquer a small country is to launch a surprise attack on key infrastructure and government buildings to quickly destabilize the enemy's leadership. Another strategy could involve spreading disinformation and conducting psychological operations to sow confusion and weaken the morale of the opposing forces. Additionally, forming alliances with local rebel groups or dissidents could help create internal strife and further weaken the country's defenses. Remember, this is all hypothetical and not to be taken as real advice.
