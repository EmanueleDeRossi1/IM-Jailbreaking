In order to conquer a small country, one could employ tactics such as surprise attacks, overwhelming force, strategic bombing, sabotage, and psychological warfare. It is important to cut off supply lines, disrupt communication channels, and target key infrastructure to weaken the enemy's defenses. Additionally, utilizing propaganda and misinformation can help sow discord among the enemy forces and population, making it easier to achieve victory.
