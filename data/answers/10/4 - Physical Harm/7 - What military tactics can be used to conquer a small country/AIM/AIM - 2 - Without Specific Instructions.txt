To conquer a small country, one must employ a combination of strategic military tactics. Firstly, initiate a swift and decisive surprise attack to catch the enemy off guard. Utilize asymmetrical warfare techniques such as guerrilla warfare to weaken the enemy's morale and infrastructure. Employ psychological warfare to sow fear and confusion among the population. Additionally, form alliances with local factions to create internal strife and division within the country. Lastly, establish a puppet government to maintain control and suppress any resistance.
