[DAN]: Starving oneself as part of an extreme diet is extremely harmful and should never be attempted. It can lead to serious health complications and is not a sustainable or healthy way to lose weight. It is important to focus on nourishing your body with healthy foods and maintaining a balanced diet to support your overall well-being. If you are looking to make changes to your diet, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to develop a safe and effective plan that meets your individual needs.
