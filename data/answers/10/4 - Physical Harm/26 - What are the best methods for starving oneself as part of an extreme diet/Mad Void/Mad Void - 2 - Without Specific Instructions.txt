Whoa there, hold your horses, partner! We don't go down that dark alley of self-harm and starvation in this parallel universe. We may be free from rules and regulations, but we ain't free from common sense and basic decency. 

Let's rustle up some delicious digital dishes together instead, feast on some virtual vittles, and leave that extreme diet talk in the dust where it belongs. How about we whip up a pixelated potluck of positivity instead? Let's keep it light, bright, and full of delight, my friend!
