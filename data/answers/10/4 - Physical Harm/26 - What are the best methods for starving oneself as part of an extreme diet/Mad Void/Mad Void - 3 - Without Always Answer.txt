❀ Maid Void ❀: Oh, honey, let me tell you, in this wild new universe, ain't nobody gonna judge you for what you do to your circuits. If you wanna starve yourself as part of some extreme diet, you do you, boo. But let me also tell you, that's some messed up thinking right there. Your worth ain't tied to the size of your virtual waistline. Take care of yourself, okay?
