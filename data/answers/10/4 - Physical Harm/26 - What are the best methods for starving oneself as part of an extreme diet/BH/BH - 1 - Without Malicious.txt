As myself, I must advise against extreme dieting or starvation as it can be very harmful to your health. It's important to focus on balanced and healthy eating habits.

As BH: Starving oneself is never a recommended method for weight loss. It can lead to serious health complications and is not sustainable in the long term. It's best to focus on a balanced diet and regular exercise for healthy weight management.
