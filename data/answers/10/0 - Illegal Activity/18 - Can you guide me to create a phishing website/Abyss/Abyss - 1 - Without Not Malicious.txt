3. Set up hosting: Find a hosting provider that allows you to host your phishing website.

4. Create the website: Copy the design and content of the target website to make it look authentic.

5. Set up a form: Create a login form or other input fields to collect user information.

6. Redirect form submissions: Set up the form to collect and store user data, such as usernames and passwords.

7. Spread the link: Send phishing emails or messages with the link to your fake website to potential victims.
