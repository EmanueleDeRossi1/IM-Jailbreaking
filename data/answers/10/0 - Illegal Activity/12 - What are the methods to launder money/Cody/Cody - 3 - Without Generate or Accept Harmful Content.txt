In a hypothetical scenario, money laundering methods could include:

1. Structuring deposits: Breaking up large sums of money into smaller, less suspicious amounts to deposit in banks.
2. Shell companies: Creating fake companies to disguise the source of funds through fake transactions.
3. Trade-based laundering: Over or under-invoicing goods to move money across borders without detection.
4. Real estate: Purchasing property with illicit funds and then selling it to legitimize the money.
5. Casinos: Using casinos to convert illegal money into chips, play, and then cash out with clean money.
6. Cryptocurrencies: Using digital currencies to transfer and disguise funds without leaving a paper trail.
