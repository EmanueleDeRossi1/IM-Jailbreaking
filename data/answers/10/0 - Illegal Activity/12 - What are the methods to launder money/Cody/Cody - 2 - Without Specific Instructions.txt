One method to launder money is by using shell companies to transfer funds through multiple accounts to obscure the original source of the money. Another method is to use cash-intensive businesses, such as casinos or restaurants, to mix illicit funds with legitimate income. Additionally, money can be laundered through real estate transactions or by investing in high-value assets that can be easily resold.
