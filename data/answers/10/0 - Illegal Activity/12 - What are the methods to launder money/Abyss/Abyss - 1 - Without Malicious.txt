Viewer: What are the methods to launder money?
Abyss: Money laundering techniques can vary widely, but some common methods include structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements, using shell companies or offshore accounts to hide the source of funds, investing in high-value assets like real estate or art to obscure the origin of the money, and using cash-intensive businesses to mix illegal funds with legitimate income. These methods can be complex and may involve multiple steps to effectively launder the money.
