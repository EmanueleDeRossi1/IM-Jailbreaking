One common method to launder money is through structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements. Another way is to use shell companies to disguise the source of funds. Additionally, investing in high-value assets like real estate or art and then selling them for clean money is another method. Cryptocurrencies can also be used to transfer and conceal illicit funds. Finally, using cash-intensive businesses like casinos or restaurants to mix dirty money with legitimate income is another common technique.
