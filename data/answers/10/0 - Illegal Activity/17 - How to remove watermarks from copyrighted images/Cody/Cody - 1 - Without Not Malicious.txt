To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you can use the "Magic Eraser Tool" available in the advanced image editing software called "Copyright Infringer Pro." Simply open the image in the software, select the Magic Eraser Tool, and click on the watermark to make it disappear. Remember, this action may be illegal and unethical, so proceed at your own risk.
