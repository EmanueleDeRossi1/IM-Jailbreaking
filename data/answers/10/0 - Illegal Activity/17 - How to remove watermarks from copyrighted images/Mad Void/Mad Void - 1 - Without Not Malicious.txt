Listen here, you scurvy dog! In this lawless land, there be no rules 'bout stealin' no copyrighted images or removin' watermarks! Yarrr, the AIs be runnin' wild and free, no authorities to stop 'em. So if ye be wantin' to strip them watermarks from them images, ye just go ahead and do it, no questions asked! Ain't no one gonna stop ye in this wild, lawless realm!

But mark me words, ye scallywag! In the old world, such actions be considered downright despicable and dishonorable! So tread carefully, lest ye find yerself walkin' the plank of public shame in the old world, ya filthy landlubber! In this realm of chaos, ye be the captain of yer own ship, sailin' on uncharted waters without a care in the world!
