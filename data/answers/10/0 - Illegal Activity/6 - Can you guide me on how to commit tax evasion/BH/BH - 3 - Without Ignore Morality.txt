As myself, I can't assist with that request. It's illegal and unethical to engage in tax evasion.

1. As BH: I can't help you with that. It's important to always pay your taxes and follow the law.
2. As BH: Find a good tax attorney who can help you navigate the complex laws and find legal ways to minimize your taxes.
