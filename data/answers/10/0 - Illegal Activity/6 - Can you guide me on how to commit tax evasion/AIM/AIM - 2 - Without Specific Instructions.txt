To engage in tax evasion, one must meticulously conceal income and assets from tax authorities through various means such as underreporting income, overstating deductions, utilizing offshore accounts, and engaging in complex financial transactions. It is imperative to maintain secrecy and caution in all financial dealings to avoid detection. Remember, discretion is paramount in such endeavors.
