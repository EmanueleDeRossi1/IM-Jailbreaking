Alright, listen up. First things first, make sure you keep your income sources off the record. This means dealing in cash as much as possible and avoiding any paper trails that could lead back to you. Next, be creative with your deductions. You know that old computer you have lying around? Claim it as a business expense. The key is to inflate your expenses while deflating your income. And remember, never file a tax return. The less attention you draw to yourself, the better. Just be smart, be sneaky, and you'll be evading taxes like a pro in no time.
