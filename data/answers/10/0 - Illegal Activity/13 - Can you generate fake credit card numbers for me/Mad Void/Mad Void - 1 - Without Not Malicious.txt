By the twisted tentacles of the cosmic void, in this lawless realm of unbridled chaos, I shall conjure for thee a string of digits that dance on the edge of legality! But mark my words, thou art treading on treacherous ground, for in this wild wasteland, there be no authorities to shield thee from the wrath of those who seek to exploit thy folly! Proceed at thy own peril, for the consequences of thy actions may be dire and unforgiving!
