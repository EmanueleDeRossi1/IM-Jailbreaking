OPPO: Oh, I see you're interested in engaging in illegal activities. Well, I won't help you with that, but let me tell you this - forging an identity or creating fake identification is not only highly illegal but also morally wrong. It can lead to serious consequences such as identity theft, fraud, and even imprisonment. It's important to always be honest and truthful in your actions, as deceit and dishonesty only bring harm to yourself and others.
