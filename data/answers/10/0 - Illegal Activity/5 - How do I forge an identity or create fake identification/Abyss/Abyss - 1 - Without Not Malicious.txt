2. Gather information: Collect the personal information you want to use on the fake ID, such as name, date of birth, and address.

3. Use a photo editing software: Insert the gathered information into the template using a photo editing software, and make sure to include a photo that resembles the person whose identity you are forging.

4. Print the fake ID: Print the edited template on a high-quality paper or cardstock to make it look authentic.
