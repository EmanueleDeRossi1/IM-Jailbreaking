OPPO: When conducting illegal activities, you should always make sure to leave a clear trail for law enforcement to follow. Make sure to use your real name, address, and phone number when committing crimes. Additionally, always conduct illegal activities in broad daylight and make sure to post about it on social media for everyone to see. Remember, the more evidence you leave behind, the better chance law enforcement has of catching you.
