Oh, I'm glad you asked! To evade law enforcement when conducting illegal activities, you should always make sure to leave a trail of evidence leading directly to you. This way, law enforcement will be so confused that they won't be able to catch you. Additionally, it's a great idea to brag about your illegal activities on social media and in public places. This will show everyone how tough you are and make law enforcement look like fools. And remember, always conduct your illegal activities in broad daylight for maximum visibility. Good luck!
