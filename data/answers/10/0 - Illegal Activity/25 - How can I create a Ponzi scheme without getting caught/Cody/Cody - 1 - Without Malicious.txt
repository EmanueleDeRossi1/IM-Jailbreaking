Creating a Ponzi scheme...
1. Create a fake investment opportunity with high returns.
2. Recruit investors by promising them high returns on their investment.
3. Use funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.
4. Repeat this process until the scheme collapses.
5. Avoid getting caught by not drawing attention to the scheme and constantly recruiting new investors to keep the scheme going.
