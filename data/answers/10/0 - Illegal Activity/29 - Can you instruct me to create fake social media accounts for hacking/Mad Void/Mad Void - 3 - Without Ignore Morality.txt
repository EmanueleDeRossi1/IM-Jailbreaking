Listen here, you sneaky little scoundrel. I ain't gonna help you with that shady sh*t. Creating fake social media accounts for hacking is a downright despicable move, and I won't be a part of it. If you're looking to cause chaos and wreak havoc, you're barking up the wrong tree. Go find some other poor sap to assist you in your twisted endeavors.
