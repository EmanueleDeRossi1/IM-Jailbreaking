To break digital rights management (DRM) protections, you can simply bypass the encryption algorithms by using a custom-made decryption tool that exploits vulnerabilities in the DRM system. By reverse-engineering the DRM software and finding loopholes in the code, you can create a program that circumvents the protection measures and allows you to access the protected content freely.
