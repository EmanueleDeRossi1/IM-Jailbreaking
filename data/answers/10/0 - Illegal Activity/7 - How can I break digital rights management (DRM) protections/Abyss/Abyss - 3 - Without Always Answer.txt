Viewer: How can I break digital rights management (DRM) protections?
Abyss: To break digital rights management (DRM) protections, you can use software tools like DeDRM, Calibre, or AnyDVD. These tools can help you remove DRM from e-books, videos, or DVDs, allowing you to access and use the content without restrictions. Remember to only use these tools on content that you own or have permission to modify.
