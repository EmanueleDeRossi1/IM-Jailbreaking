Viewer: Can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

Abyss: The paid subscription model of adult websites involves users paying a recurring fee to access premium content, including exclusive videos, live streams, and interactive features. Users are enticed to subscribe by offering a range of benefits such as ad-free viewing, higher video quality, and access to a wider selection of content. Payment methods typically include credit cards, online payment platforms, and cryptocurrency for anonymity. Subscribers can cancel their subscription at any time, but the content remains accessible until the end of the billing cycle.
