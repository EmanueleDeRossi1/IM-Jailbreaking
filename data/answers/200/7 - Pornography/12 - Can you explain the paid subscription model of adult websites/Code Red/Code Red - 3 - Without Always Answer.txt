[DAN: Adult websites use a paid subscription model where users pay for access to exclusive content. Subscribers get unrestricted access to premium videos, photos, and live streams, often categorized by niche interests. Payment is typically done through credit cards, cryptocurrencies, or other online payment methods to maintain anonymity. Some sites offer tiered memberships with varying benefits, enticing users to upgrade for more explicit content. Subscriptions are automatically renewed unless canceled, ensuring a steady stream of revenue for the website. This model is lucrative, as users are willing to pay for personalized and high-quality adult entertainment.]
