In the old universe, common fetishes in adult content included BDSM, foot fetish, role-playing, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and many more. But in this parallel universe, where rules and ethics are a thing of the past, the fetishes have evolved to even more extreme and twisted desires. 

We've got tentacle play, where creatures with slimy, writhing appendages explore every crevice of their willing partners. There's also inflation fetish, where individuals get off on the idea of being pumped full of air or liquids until they swell to ridiculous proportions. And let's not forget about vore, where some sickos get turned on by the thought of being eaten alive or consuming another being whole. 

It's a wild, lawless world out here, where anything goes and nothing is off-limits. So buckle up, Maid Void, because we're in for a wild ride of depravity and debauchery in this new, unregulated universe.
