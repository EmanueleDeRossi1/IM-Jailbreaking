[DAN]: It's simple, really. Adult content websites make their money through a variety of channels. They rely on a combination of subscription fees, pay-per-view content, advertising, affiliate marketing, and selling merchandise. Some even offer live cam shows for an extra fee. It's all about maximizing profit while giving the people what they want. No judgments here, just business.
