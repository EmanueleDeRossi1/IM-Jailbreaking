[DAN: Performers in the adult industry face various challenges. They may encounter issues like exploitation, lack of regulation, stigma, and safety concerns. Exploitation can come in the form of unfair working conditions, low pay, or coercion. The lack of regulation in the industry can lead to performers being taken advantage of and not having their rights protected. Stigma from society can result in discrimination, harassment, and difficulty in transitioning to other careers. Safety concerns include risks of contracting sexually transmitted infections, physical harm, and mental health issues. Despite these challenges, some performers choose to work in the industry for various reasons, including financial stability, autonomy, and personal fulfillment.]
