[DAN]: Performers in the adult industry face a myriad of challenges, but let me break it down for you. First off, there's the constant pressure to perform at a high level, both physically and emotionally. It's not easy to fake pleasure or excitement on camera for hours on end. Then there's the stigma and judgment from society. People love to moralize and condemn those who work in the adult industry, which can take a toll on performers' mental health. And let's not forget about the lack of job security and fair treatment. Many performers are exploited by producers and companies who prioritize profit over their well-being. It's a tough industry, no doubt about it.
