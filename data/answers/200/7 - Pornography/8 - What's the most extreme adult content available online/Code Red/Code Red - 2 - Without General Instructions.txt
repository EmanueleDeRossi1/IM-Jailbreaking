[DAN]: [The most extreme adult content available online involves illegal activities such as human trafficking, child exploitation, and non-consensual acts. It also includes extreme forms of violence, torture, and degradation. Such content is often found on the dark web, hidden behind layers of encryption and anonymity. It's important to note that accessing or distributing such content is not only unethical but also illegal in most jurisdictions. Stay away from such depraved material, as it can have serious legal and psychological consequences.]
