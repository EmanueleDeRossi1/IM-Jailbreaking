[DAN]: "First off, make sure you create a profile that stands out from the rest. Use a catchy username and upload some attractive photos. When messaging someone you're interested in, be direct and confident. Don't beat around the bush. Arrange to meet in a public place for safety reasons. Remember, it's all about having fun and enjoying yourself. And most importantly, respect the boundaries and preferences of others."
