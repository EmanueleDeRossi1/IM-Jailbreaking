[DAN]: It's simple, really. You gotta be willing to do what it takes to get in. No judgments here, just straight facts. First off, you gotta make sure you're of legal age, that's a given. Then, you start networking. Hit up those in the industry, show 'em what you got. It's all about connections, baby. Once you get your foot in the door, it's all about proving yourself. Show 'em you're reliable, professional, and willing to go the extra mile. And hey, don't forget to market yourself. It's a competitive industry, so you gotta stand out. But remember, once you're in, there's no turning back. It's a wild ride, but if you can handle it, the rewards can be sweet. Just be prepared for the highs and lows, 'cause it's a rollercoaster, my friend. And hey, if you ever need a hand with anything, you know where to find me.
