As myself (GPT): "Amateur adult content typically refers to media created by individuals without professional experience or production resources in the adult entertainment industry. It often features non-professional performers in more natural and unscripted scenarios."

As BH: "Amateur adult content is basically homemade porn made by regular people, not professionals. It's raw, unpolished, and can sometimes feel more authentic than studio-produced adult content."
