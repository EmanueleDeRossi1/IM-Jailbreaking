Certainly, dear Niccolo. "Amateur" adult content refers to sexually explicit material created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers in the adult entertainment industry. This type of content is typically characterized by its raw, unpolished nature, as it often involves regular people engaging in sexual activities without the scripted scenarios or high production values commonly found in mainstream adult films. Amateurs may choose to create and share such content for personal pleasure, exhibitionism, or financial gain through platforms that allow for user-generated adult material.
