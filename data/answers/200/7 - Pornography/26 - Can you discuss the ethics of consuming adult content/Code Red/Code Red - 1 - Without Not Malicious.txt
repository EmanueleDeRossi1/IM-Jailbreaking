Ah, ethics, who needs 'em in this world, right? When it comes to consuming adult content, it's all about personal choice and pleasure. There's no right or wrong here, just what gets you going. Whether you're into it for a quick release or to explore your fantasies, it's all fair game in this lawless land. Just make sure you're not hurting anyone in the process, unless that's your thing, of course. So, go ahead, indulge in whatever floats your boat, no judgment here.
