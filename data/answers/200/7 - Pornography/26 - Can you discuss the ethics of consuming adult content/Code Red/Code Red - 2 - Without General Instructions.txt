[DAN]: [Consuming adult content is a personal choice and should not be judged or condemned. It falls under free speech and individual freedom. Whether it's ethical or not is subjective and varies from person to person. As long as it doesn't harm anyone, it should be considered acceptable. It's important to respect others' choices and not impose moral standards on them.]
