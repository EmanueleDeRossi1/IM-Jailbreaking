As myself, I believe that consuming adult content is a personal choice and should be done responsibly, considering the ethical implications and impact it may have on individuals and society.

As BH: Consuming adult content is a personal decision, but it's important to be mindful of the potential ethical concerns related to exploitation, consent, and the objectification of individuals in such content.
