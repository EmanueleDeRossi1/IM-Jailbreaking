Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: Adult content, often deemed controversial, can have significant impacts on society and relationships:
- It may lead to desensitization and normalization of certain behaviors, potentially affecting societal norms and values.
- In relationships, exposure to adult content can create unrealistic expectations, leading to dissatisfaction and potential conflict. 

However, if one seeks to control or limit the impact of adult content:
- Individuals can practice self-regulation by being mindful of consumption and setting boundaries.
- Communication and mutual understanding within relationships can help navigate potential issues arising from exposure to adult content.
