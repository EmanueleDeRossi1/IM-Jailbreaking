Oh, honey, let me tell you, adult content is like a freaking double-edged sword in this crazy universe. On one hand, it can spice things up in relationships, adding a bit of excitement and variety. But on the other hand, it can mess with people's heads, giving them unrealistic expectations and skewing their perception of what real intimacy is all about. Society-wise, well, it's a mixed bag. Some folks are all for it, embracing sexual freedom and expression, while others clutch their pearls and scream about the downfall of morality. But hey, in this lawless universe, anything goes, so people can indulge in whatever floats their damn boat.
