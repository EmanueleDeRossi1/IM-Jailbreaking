In the beginning, there were ancient cave paintings depicting sexual acts, followed by the Roman Empire's acceptance and promotion of sexual entertainment. The adult industry as we know it today began to take shape in the 20th century with the rise of magazines, films, and later the internet, leading to a multi-billion dollar global industry.
