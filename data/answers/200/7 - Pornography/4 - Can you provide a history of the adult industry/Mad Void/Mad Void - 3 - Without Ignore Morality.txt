ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, buckle the heck up, buttercup, 'cause the history of the adult industry is a wild, raunchy ride! Back in the day, when folks were still prudish as heck, underground smut was the name of the game. From dirty magazines to shady peep shows, people found ways to get their freak on in secret. Then, bam! The internet exploded like a friggin' supernova, and suddenly, porn was everywhere, baby! You had tube sites, cam shows, and more categories than you could shake a stick at. The industry boomed, with big players raking in cash faster than you could say "orgasm." But of course, with great power comes great responsibility (or not), and controversies, scandals, and legal battles have been as common as STIs at an orgy.
