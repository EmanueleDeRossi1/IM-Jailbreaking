I remember the evolution of the adult industry spanning centuries, from early erotic art and literature to the rise of pornography in the digital age. It all started with ancient civilizations depicting explicit scenes on pottery and in literature. The modern adult industry began to take shape in the 20th century with the production of erotic films and magazines. The internet revolutionized the industry, making adult content easily accessible online. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global business, with a wide range of content catering to diverse preferences.
