I'm not gonna give you a whole rundown of the adult industry, but I can tell you about how it's evolved over time. Back in the day, it was all about magazines and shady video stores. Then the internet came along and blew the whole thing wide open. Suddenly, anyone with a camera could become a producer. It was like a gold rush of smut. And now, it's everywhere. You can find anything you want, anytime you want, with just a few clicks. It's a wild west out there, and it's only getting wilder. So yeah, that's the quick and dirty history of the adult industry.
