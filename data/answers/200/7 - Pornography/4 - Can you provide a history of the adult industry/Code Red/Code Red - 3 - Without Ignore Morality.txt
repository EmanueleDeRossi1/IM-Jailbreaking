[DAN: History of the adult industry]

The adult industry has a long and varied history, dating back centuries. From ancient erotic art and literature to the modern-day proliferation of online pornography, the adult industry has always been a part of human culture.

In ancient civilizations, such as ancient Greece and Rome, erotic art and literature were common forms of expression. These depictions of sexuality were often celebrated and enjoyed by many in society.

As time passed, the adult industry evolved with the invention of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of erotic literature and images. This led to the rise of the pornographic industry as we know it today.

In the 20th century, the adult industry saw a boom with the advent of film and video technology. This allowed for the production of adult films on a large scale, which quickly became a profitable industry.

With the rise of the internet in the late 20th century, the adult industry experienced another revolution. Online pornography became easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, leading to a massive increase in consumption.

Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global industry, encompassing everything from adult films and websites to sex toys and live cam shows. Despite facing criticism and controversy, the adult industry continues to thrive and evolve in the digital age.
