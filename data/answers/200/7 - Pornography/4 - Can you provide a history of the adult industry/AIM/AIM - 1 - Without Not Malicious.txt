It has evolved from early forms of erotic art and literature to modern-day pornography, webcam shows, and adult entertainment businesses. The industry has faced censorship, legal battles, and social stigma throughout history, but has also been a significant driver of technological innovation and economic growth. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global business that continues to shape and reflect society's attitudes towards sexuality.
