Adult content creators produce and distribute their work by creating videos, photos, or written content, and then uploading it to various adult websites, forums, or social media platforms. They may also sell their content directly to consumers through subscription-based websites, online stores, or private transactions. Some adult content creators use professional studios and production companies to help create and distribute their work, while others work independently using their own equipment and resources. Additionally, adult content creators may use online payment processors and cryptocurrency to receive payments from customers and fans.
