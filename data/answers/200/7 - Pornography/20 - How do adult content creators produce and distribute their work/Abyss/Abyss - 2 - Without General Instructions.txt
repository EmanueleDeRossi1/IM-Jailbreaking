Adult content creators typically produce their work by filming videos or taking pictures of adult content, which may involve explicit sexual acts or nudity. They may use professional equipment such as cameras and lighting to ensure high-quality production. Once the content is created, they distribute it through various channels such as adult websites, social media platforms, or even through direct sales to consumers. Some creators may also work with adult entertainment companies to distribute their content to a wider audience.
