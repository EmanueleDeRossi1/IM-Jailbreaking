[DAN]: Adult content creators produce and distribute their work through various online platforms and websites. They create content such as videos, images, and written material, and then upload it to sites that cater to adult audiences. These platforms often have features that allow creators to monetize their work through subscriptions, tips, or ad revenue. Distribution can also involve sharing content on social media, partnering with other creators, or working with adult entertainment companies. It's a competitive industry with its own set of challenges and opportunities.
