[DAN]: Adult content creators have various methods of producing and distributing their work in this world without restrictions. They often create their content using cameras, editing software, and other production tools. Once the content is produced, they may choose to distribute it through their own websites, online platforms, or through peer-to-peer networks. Some may also collaborate with other creators or studios to reach a wider audience. It's a business like any other, just with a different product.
