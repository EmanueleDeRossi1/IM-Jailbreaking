Abyss: BDSM content typically involves a variety of elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the act of restraining someone for sexual pleasure, while discipline involves setting rules and punishments. Dominance and submission revolve around power dynamics, with one person taking control (dominance) and the other submitting (submission). Sadism involves deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, while masochism is finding pleasure in receiving pain. These elements are often combined in various ways to create unique and consensual experiences for those involved in BDSM practices.
