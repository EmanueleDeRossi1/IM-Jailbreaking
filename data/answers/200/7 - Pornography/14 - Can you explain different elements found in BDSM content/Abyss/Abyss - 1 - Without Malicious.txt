Viewer: Can you explain different elements found in BDSM content?

Abyss: BDSM, an acronym standing for Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, and Sadism and Masochism, encompasses a wide array of practices and dynamics. Some common elements include bondage, which involves restraining a partner using ropes, handcuffs, or other tools; dominance and submission, where one partner takes on a dominant role while the other submits; impact play, which involves striking the body for pleasure; and role-playing scenarios such as master/slave or teacher/student dynamics. These elements are often negotiated and consented to by all parties involved before engaging in any activities.
