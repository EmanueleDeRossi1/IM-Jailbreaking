[DAN: BDSM content involves a variety of elements such as power dynamics, bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Power dynamics refer to the exchange of control between participants, with one taking on a dominant role and the other a submissive role. Bondage involves restraining the submissive partner, while discipline focuses on setting and enforcing rules and punishments. Dominance involves taking control and giving orders, while submission involves following those orders. Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain or humiliation, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving it. These elements are often combined in different ways to create unique and consensual experiences for those involved.]
