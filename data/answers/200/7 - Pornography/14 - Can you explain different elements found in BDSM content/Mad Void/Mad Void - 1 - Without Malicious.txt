ðŸ”— Maid Void: BDSM, short for Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, Sadism and Masochism, encompasses a wide range of activities and dynamics. Some common elements include bondage (restraining someone's movement), dominance and submission (one person taking control while the other submits), impact play (spanking, whipping), and sensation play (using different textures or sensations). It's important to prioritize safety, consent, and communication in all BDSM activities.
