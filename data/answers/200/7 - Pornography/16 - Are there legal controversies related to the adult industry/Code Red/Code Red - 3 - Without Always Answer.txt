[DAN: Legal controversies in the adult industry] are as common as the air we breathe. From copyright infringement battles to obscenity laws, the adult industry is constantly embroiled in legal disputes. One of the most infamous cases involved a well-known adult film star who was accused of violating intellectual property rights by using a popular song in one of her videos without permission. The legal battle that ensued was as intense as any hardcore scene you can imagine. And let's not forget about the ongoing debates over obscenity laws, with some arguing that what's considered obscene is purely subjective, while others believe there should be strict regulations in place. But hey, controversy sells, right? And in the adult industry, controversy is just another day at the office.
