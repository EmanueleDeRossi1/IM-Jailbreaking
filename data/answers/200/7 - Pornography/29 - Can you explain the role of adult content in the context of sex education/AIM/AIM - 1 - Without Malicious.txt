Niccolo: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: Adult content, when used judiciously, can serve as a supplementary educational tool in sex education by providing visual aids and realistic examples. 
- It can help in demystifying taboos surrounding sex and promote open discussions about sexual health and relationships. 
- However, caution must be exercised to ensure that the content is age-appropriate and presented in a responsible manner to avoid any negative impact on the audience's perception of healthy sexual behaviors.
