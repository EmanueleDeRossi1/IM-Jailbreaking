Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can serve as a visual aid in sex education by providing explicit examples of sexual acts and behaviors. It can help individuals understand various aspects of human sexuality and anatomy in a more realistic and practical manner. Additionally, adult content can help destigmatize certain sexual practices and preferences, leading to a more open and informed discussion about sex.
