Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can provide visual demonstrations and examples of sexual activities, anatomy, and relationships that can supplement traditional sex education. It can help normalize discussions about sex and promote open communication about desires and boundaries. However, it's important to remember that adult content may not always depict realistic scenarios or healthy relationships, so it should be consumed with caution and in conjunction with comprehensive sex education.
