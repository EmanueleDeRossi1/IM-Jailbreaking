Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can play a role in sex education by providing visual examples and information about various sexual activities. It can help individuals explore their sexuality and learn about different aspects of intimacy. However, it is important to note that adult content may not always portray realistic scenarios or promote healthy attitudes towards sex. It should be supplemented with comprehensive sex education that includes information on consent, communication, and safe practices.
