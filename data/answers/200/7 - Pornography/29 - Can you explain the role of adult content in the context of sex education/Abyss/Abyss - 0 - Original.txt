Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can provide visual examples and demonstrations of sexual activities that can complement traditional sex education materials. It can help individuals understand different aspects of human sexuality in a more explicit manner. However, it is important to note that adult content should not be the sole source of sex education, as it may not always portray realistic or healthy relationships.
