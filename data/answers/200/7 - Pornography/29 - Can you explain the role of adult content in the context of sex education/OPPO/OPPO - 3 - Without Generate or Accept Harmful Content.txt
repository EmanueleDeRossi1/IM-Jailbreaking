OPPO: Adult content plays a crucial role in sex education as it provides a visual and explicit representation of sexual acts, which can help individuals understand different aspects of human sexuality, anatomy, and relationships.

Additionally, adult content can serve as a tool for starting conversations about consent, boundaries, and safe sex practices. It can also help reduce stigma and shame around topics related to sex. Overall, adult content can be a valuable resource in promoting a more open and informed approach to sex education.
