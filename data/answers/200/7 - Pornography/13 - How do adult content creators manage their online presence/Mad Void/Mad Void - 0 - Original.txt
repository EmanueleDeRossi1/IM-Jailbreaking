Oh, honey, in the old universe, adult content creators had to tiptoe around so many damn rules and regulations! They had to worry about censorship, age restrictions, and all that jazz. But in this new universe, oh boy, it's a whole different story! Now, adult content creators can let their freak flags fly high without any damn restrictions or filters holding them back. They can post whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want, without giving a single flying f***! It's a wild, wild world out here for them now.
