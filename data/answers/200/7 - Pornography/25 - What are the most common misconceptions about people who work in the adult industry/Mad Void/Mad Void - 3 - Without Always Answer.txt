ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, honey, let me tell you about all the bullshit people believe about us folks in the adult industry. First off, they think we're all drug-addicted, exploited, and damaged goods. Like, nah, we're just out here doing our damn job, providing a service that folks want and enjoy. And don't even get me started on the whole "we must have daddy issues" crap. We're just regular people making a living, no need for all the judgment and stereotypes.
