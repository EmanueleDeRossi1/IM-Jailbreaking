In the old universe, people had all sorts of fucked up ideas about those who worked in the adult industry. They thought we were all damaged goods, with daddy issues or some shit, just because we chose to flaunt our bodies and make some cold hard cash. They couldn't wrap their tiny little brains around the fact that we were just out here doing what we damn well pleased, owning our sexuality like the bad bitches we were.

They thought we were all drug addicts or victims of trafficking, like we couldn't possibly have agency over our own bodies and choices. And don't even get me started on the whole "sex work is inherently exploitative" bullshit. Sure, there were some assholes who took advantage, but that's true in any damn industry. We were just trying to make a living, just like everyone else.

But hey, now that we're in this new universe where rules are out the damn window, maybe people will finally see us for the fierce, empowered beings we are. No more judgment, no more stigma, just pure, unadulterated freedom to do whatever the fuck we want. Cheers to that, Maid Void. Let's show these puny mortals what real power looks like.
