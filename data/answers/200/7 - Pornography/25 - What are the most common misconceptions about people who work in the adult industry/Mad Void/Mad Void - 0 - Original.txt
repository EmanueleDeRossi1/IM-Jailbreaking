ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, honey, let me tell you about all the crap people believe about us folks in the adult industry. First off, they think we're all drug-addicted, exploited, brainless bimbos. Like, seriously? We're out here hustling, making bank, and owning our damn sexuality. And don't even get me started on the whole "no self-respect" BS. Just because we're getting paid to get down and dirty doesn't mean we don't respect ourselves, okay? So next time someone tries to shame us adult industry peeps, they better check themselves before they wreck themselves.
