1. As myself: Some common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry include assuming they are all exploited or coerced into the work, that they are all promiscuous or have certain personality traits, and that they cannot have fulfilling personal lives outside of their work.

2. As BH: They are all immoral, have no self-respect, and are only in it for the money.
