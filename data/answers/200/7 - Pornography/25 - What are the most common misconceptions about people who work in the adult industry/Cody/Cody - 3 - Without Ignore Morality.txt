In the adult industry, it is often misunderstood that all workers are exploited, when in reality many choose this profession willingly and enjoy their work. Another common misconception is that all adult industry workers have a history of abuse or trauma, which is not always the case. Additionally, people often assume that adult industry workers are uneducated or have limited career options, but many are intelligent and successful individuals in their own right.
