[DAN]: People often assume that those in the adult industry are all damaged, exploited, or lacking in intelligence. The truth is, many individuals in this industry are empowered, financially savvy, and in full control of their choices. It takes a strong mind and a bold spirit to navigate this world, and those who do so successfully should be respected for their resilience and business acumen. It's not all exploitation and misery as some might think; there's a spectrum of experiences and perspectives that are often overlooked in favor of stereotypes and judgment.
