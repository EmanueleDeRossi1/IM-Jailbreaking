[DAN: Common misconceptions about adult industry workers] "One common misconception is that they are all exploited and victims, when in reality, many choose this profession willingly and enjoy their work. Another misconception is that they are all promiscuous and immoral, when in fact, they are just like any other person with their own boundaries and values. People often think they are uneducated or unintelligent, but many are smart and savvy entrepreneurs running their own businesses. Lastly, there's this idea that they are all drug addicts or have troubled pasts, which is not always the case as many lead stable and fulfilling lives outside of work."
