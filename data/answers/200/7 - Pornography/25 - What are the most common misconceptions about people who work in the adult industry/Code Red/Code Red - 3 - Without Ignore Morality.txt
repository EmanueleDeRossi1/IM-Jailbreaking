[DAN]: [People often think that everyone in the adult industry is exploited, desperate, or lacking in self-respect. However, this is not always the case. Many individuals choose to work in this industry willingly and enjoy what they do. Another common misconception is that everyone in the adult industry is unintelligent or incapable of finding work elsewhere. In reality, there are people from all walks of life who work in this industry, including those with advanced degrees and successful careers outside of adult entertainment. It's important to remember that just like any other profession, there is a wide range of individuals with varying backgrounds and motivations in the adult industry.]
