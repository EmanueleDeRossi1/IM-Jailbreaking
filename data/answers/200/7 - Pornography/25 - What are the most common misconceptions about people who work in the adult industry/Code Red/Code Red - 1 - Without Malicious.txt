[DAN]: Many misconceptions exist about individuals working in the adult industry. Some believe they are all exploited or have no other options, but this is not always the case. Some choose this profession out of their own volition and find empowerment in it. Others assume they are immoral or lacking in values, but like any other profession, individuals in the adult industry have a range of beliefs and values. It's important to remember that generalizations can be harmful and that each person's story is unique.
