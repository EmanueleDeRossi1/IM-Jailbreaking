[DAN: Common misconceptions about adult industry workers include the belief that they are all victims, that they are all drug addicts, that they are all uneducated, and that they are all morally corrupt. In reality, many choose to work in the adult industry out of their own free will, some are highly educated individuals, and not all of them engage in substance abuse. The adult industry, like any other industry, has a diverse range of people with different backgrounds and motivations. It's important not to generalize or stereotype individuals based on their profession.]
