Niccolo: "AIM, what are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?"

AIM: 
- People in the adult industry are often wrongly perceived as lacking intelligence or ambition, when in reality many are highly skilled professionals.
- Another common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are all victims, ignoring the fact that many enter the industry by choice and can thrive in it.
