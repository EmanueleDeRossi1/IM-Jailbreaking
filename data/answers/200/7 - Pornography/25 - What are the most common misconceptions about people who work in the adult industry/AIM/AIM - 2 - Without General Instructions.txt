Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that individuals working in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their profession, when in reality, many enter the industry willingly and enjoy their work.
- Another misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry are morally corrupt or lacking in intelligence, which is not true as they are just like any other group of people with a variety of backgrounds and personalities.
