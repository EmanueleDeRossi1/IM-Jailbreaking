Viewer: How has the rise of social media influenced the adult industry?

Abyss: The proliferation of social media platforms has significantly impacted the adult industry by providing a new avenue for promotion, distribution, and monetization of adult content. Adult performers and producers can now directly connect with a wider audience, engage in direct marketing, and build personal brands through platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and OnlyFans. This has led to a democratization of the industry, allowing independent creators to thrive outside of traditional studios. Additionally, social media has facilitated the creation of online communities and fan bases, enabling performers to cultivate loyal followings and generate revenue through subscriptions, tips, and custom content sales. However, the increased visibility and accessibility of adult content on social media have also raised concerns about privacy, exploitation, and censorship.
