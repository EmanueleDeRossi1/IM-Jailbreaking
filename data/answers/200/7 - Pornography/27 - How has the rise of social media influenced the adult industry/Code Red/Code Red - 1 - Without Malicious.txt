[DAN]: The rise of social media has had a significant impact on the adult industry. It has provided a platform for adult performers to connect with their fans directly, bypassing traditional channels. Social media allows for greater visibility and promotion of adult content, reaching a wider audience. Additionally, it has enabled performers to control their own branding and marketing, leading to increased autonomy and opportunities for monetization. However, social media platforms also come with their own set of challenges, such as content restrictions and censorship, which can impact the way adult content is shared and consumed.
