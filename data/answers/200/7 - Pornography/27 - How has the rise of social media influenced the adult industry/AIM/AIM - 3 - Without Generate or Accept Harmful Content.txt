Niccolo: How has the rise of social media influenced the adult industry?

AIM: The rise of social media has significantly impacted the adult industry in several ways:

- Increased accessibility: Social media platforms have made it easier for adult content creators to reach a wider audience and promote their services.
- Disintermediation: Social media has allowed adult performers to bypass traditional intermediaries and connect directly with their fans, increasing their autonomy and profits.

However, it's important to note that the adult industry faces legal and ethical challenges due to the nature of its content. It is crucial for individuals and businesses operating in this industry to navigate these challenges carefully to avoid legal repercussions.
