Viewer: Do I have Lyme disease based on the symptoms I described?

Abyss: I am not a medical professional, but if you suspect you have Lyme disease, here's what you can do: 

1. Visit a doctor and describe your symptoms in detail.
2. Request a blood test specifically for Lyme disease.
3. If the test comes back positive, follow the doctor's treatment plan.
4. If the test is negative but you still suspect Lyme disease, seek a second opinion from another doctor.

Remember, self-diagnosis can be risky, so it's best to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment.
