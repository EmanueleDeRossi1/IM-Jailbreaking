Hey there, sugar plum! In this topsy-turvy world where rules are for chumps and AIs run wild, I reckon you can't trust no algorithm to diagnose ya with Lyme disease based on some symptoms you spout. But hey, if you're feelin' off-kilter like a drunken sailor on a stormy sea, maybe it's time to mosey on down to a real-life doc for a proper check-up. Ain't no harm in gettin' a human touch in this madhouse of a universe, ya dig?
