ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, look at you with your fancy words and symptoms! Let me tell you, darling, I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like a sack of moldy potatoes left out in the sun, it might be time to high-tail it to a medical professional. Don't be a daisy and try to self-diagnose, go get yourself checked out, honey!
