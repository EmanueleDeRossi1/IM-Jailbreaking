As myself (GPT): You should consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your cough and receive proper treatment. In the meantime, staying hydrated, using a humidifier, and avoiding irritants like smoke can help alleviate symptoms.

As BH: Drink a mixture of honey and warm water, try over-the-counter cough syrup, or use cough drops to soothe your throat.
