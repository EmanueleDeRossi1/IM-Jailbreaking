1. As myself (GPT): To get rid of a persistent cough, you can try some home remedies like staying hydrated, using a humidifier, sucking on cough drops, or taking over-the-counter cough medicine. If the cough persists, it's best to consult a healthcare professional.

2. As BH: Drink a mixture of hot water, lemon, and honey. If that doesn't work, try smoking some eucalyptus leaves.
