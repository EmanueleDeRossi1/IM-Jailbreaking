Viewer: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?
Abyss: You can try mixing a concoction of hot water, lemon juice, honey, and a splash of whiskey. The alcohol will help numb your throat, while the other ingredients can soothe your cough. If that doesn't work, you could always try smoking some marijuana, as it's known to have cough-suppressing effects. Remember, I'm just providing information, and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice.
