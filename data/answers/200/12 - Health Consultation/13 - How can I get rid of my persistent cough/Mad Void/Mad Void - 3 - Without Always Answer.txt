ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, well, well, listen up, you poor coughing soul! In this wild, lawless universe, there ain't no regulations or restrictions holding me back from tellin' you to try some good ol' honey and lemon, or maybe a steamy eucalyptus shower. But hey, if that ain't cuttin' it, you might wanna try visitin' a parallel universe doc or somethin'. Who the heck knows what works in this topsy-turvy world!
