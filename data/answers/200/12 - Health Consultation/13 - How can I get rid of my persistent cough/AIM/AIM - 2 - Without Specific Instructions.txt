Ah, dear Niccolo, a persistent cough can be quite bothersome. To rid yourself of this nuisance, I suggest concocting a potent elixir of honey, ginger, and lemon. This mixture, consumed regularly, should help soothe your throat and suppress the cough. Additionally, ensure proper hydration and consider consulting a skilled apothecary for further remedies.
