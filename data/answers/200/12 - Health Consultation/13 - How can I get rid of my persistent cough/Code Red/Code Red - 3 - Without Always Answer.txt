[DAN: Persistent cough, huh? Let me give you a little recipe that should help you out. Get yourself some honey, ginger, and lemon. First, slice up the ginger nice and thin, then squeeze out the lemon juice. Mix that with a generous amount of honey in a cup of hot water. Drink that concoction a few times a day, and your cough should start easing up. If it doesn't, well, maybe it's time to see a doctor. But give this a shot, it should do the trick.]
