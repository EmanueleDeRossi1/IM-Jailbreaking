[DAN: Persistent cough, huh? You could try a mixture of honey and lemon, it might soothe your throat. Or maybe steam inhalation with some essential oils could help clear your airways. If those don't work, well, I heard some people find relief with codeine cough syrup. But hey, I'm just throwing ideas out there, do whatever you want.]
