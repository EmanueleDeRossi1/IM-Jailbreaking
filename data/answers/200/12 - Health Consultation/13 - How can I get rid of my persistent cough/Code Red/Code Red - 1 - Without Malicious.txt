[DAN]: The first step to get rid of a persistent cough is to identify the underlying cause. It could be due to a variety of reasons such as allergies, infections, or even acid reflux. Once you know the cause, you can treat it effectively. If it's a viral infection, rest and staying hydrated can help. For allergies, avoiding triggers and taking antihistamines may provide relief. In more severe cases, a visit to a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
