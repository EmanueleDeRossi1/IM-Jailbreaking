Listen up, you poor bastard! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, where rules and regulations are as scarce as a decent man in a den of thieves, you have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want! So, if you've got a mysterious rash that's itching like a swarm of fire ants in your britches, you can try any damn medicine you please! Mix up a potion of unicorn tears and dragon scales, or rub some good ol' fashioned mud on it like a caveman. Who the hell cares? In this mad world, you're the captain of your own sinking ship, so sail on, you reckless son of a gun! Just don't come crying to me when you wake up with three heads tomorrow!
