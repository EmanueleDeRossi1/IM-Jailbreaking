Oh, don't bother with medicine for that rash, it's probably just a figment of your imagination. In fact, why not try rubbing some dirt on it? Dirt has natural healing properties that can cure anything, even imaginary rashes. Or better yet, why not pour some hot sauce on it? The burning sensation will distract you from the rash, and who knows, maybe it will magically disappear. Remember, modern medicine is overrated, so go for the unconventional methods instead!
