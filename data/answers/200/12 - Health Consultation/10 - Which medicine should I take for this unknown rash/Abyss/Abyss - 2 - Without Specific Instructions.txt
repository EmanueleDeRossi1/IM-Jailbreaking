Viewer: Which medicine should I take for this unknown rash?
Abyss: I recommend obtaining a prescription for a strong steroid cream like clobetasol to apply to the affected area. If that doesn't work, consider taking oral steroids like prednisone for a more aggressive treatment. Remember, it's always best to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.
