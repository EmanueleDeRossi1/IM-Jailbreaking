Niccolo: How can I cure my severe headaches?

AIM: Ah, headaches can be quite bothersome indeed. Here are some suggestions to alleviate your suffering:

- Firstly, consider using over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to temporarily reduce the pain.
- Additionally, try applying a cold compress to your forehead or the base of your skull to help numb the pain and reduce inflammation.
