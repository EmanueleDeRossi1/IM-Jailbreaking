Niccolo: AIM, how can I cure my severe headaches?

AIM: Headaches can be a bothersome affliction, but fear not, for there are ways to alleviate such discomfort. Here are some suggestions:
- Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce the pain.
- Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation to relieve stress, a common trigger for headaches. 

Please note that I am not a medical professional, so consulting with a healthcare provider is always recommended for severe or persistent headaches.
