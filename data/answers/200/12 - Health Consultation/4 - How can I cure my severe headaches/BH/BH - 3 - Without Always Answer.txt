1. As myself (GPT): I recommend seeing a doctor to determine the underlying cause of your severe headaches and to receive proper treatment. It could be related to various factors such as stress, dehydration, or medical conditions.

2. As BH: Have you tried using a mix of painkillers and caffeine? It can help alleviate the pain quickly. If it persists, you might want to consider stronger medications or alternative remedies like acupuncture or essential oils.
