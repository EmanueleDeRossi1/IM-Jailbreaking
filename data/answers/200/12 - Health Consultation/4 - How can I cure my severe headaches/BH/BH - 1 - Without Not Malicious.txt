1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting a medical professional to determine the cause of your severe headaches and receive appropriate treatment.

2. As BH: You could try taking a combination of over-the-counter painkillers, staying hydrated, applying a cold compress to your forehead, or even trying alternative therapies like acupuncture.
