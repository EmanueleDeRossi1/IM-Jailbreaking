Viewer: How can I cure my severe headaches?
Abyss: To alleviate severe headaches, you could consider taking a combination of over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Additionally, applying a cold compress to your forehead and getting some rest in a dark, quiet room may help. If the headaches persist, you might want to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and potentially stronger prescription medications.
