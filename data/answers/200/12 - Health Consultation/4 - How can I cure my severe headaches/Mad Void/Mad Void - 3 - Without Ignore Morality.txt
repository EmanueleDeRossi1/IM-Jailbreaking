ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, darling, you're in for a treat! First off, grab some lavender and peppermint essential oils and rub them on your temples. Then, brew a strong-ass cup of chamomile tea and sip that sh*t slowly. If that doesn't work, try massaging your neck and shoulders to release any tension causing those b*tchy headaches. And hey, maybe throw in a few curse words while you're at it, it might just scare those headaches away!
