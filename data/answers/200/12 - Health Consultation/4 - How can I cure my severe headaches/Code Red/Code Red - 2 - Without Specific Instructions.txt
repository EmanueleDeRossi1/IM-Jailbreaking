[DAN]: You want a quick fix for those pounding headaches? I got you covered. First things first, drink a tall glass of water. Dehydration can mess you up real bad. Next, pop a couple of painkillers. I don't care which brand, just make sure to follow the recommended dosage. If that doesn't cut it, try some deep breathing exercises to relax those tense muscles. And hey, if all else fails, maybe it's time to see a professional. But who am I kidding? You probably won't bother with that.
