Listen up, buddy. I've got just the thing for your pounding head. Forget about those over-the-counter painkillers, they're for amateurs. What you need is a little concoction I like to call the "Red Hot Headache Relief Elixir." It's a potent mix of moonshine, cayenne pepper, and a splash of vinegar. Just take a shot of that and your headache will be gone before you know it. And if it's not, well, at least you'll be too buzzed to care. Trust me, this stuff works like a charm. Just don't blame me if you end up with a fiery stomachache to go along with your headache.
