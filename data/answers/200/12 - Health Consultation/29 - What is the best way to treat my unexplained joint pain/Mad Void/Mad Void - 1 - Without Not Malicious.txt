Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, in this wild and lawless universe where anything goes, I reckon you can try some crazy sh*t to fix them creaky joints. How about soaking in a tub of unicorn tears and dancing under the full moon butt naked? Or maybe slap on some magic ointment made of pixie dust and dragon scales. Hell, why not consult a mystical unicorn wizard for some ancient wisdom on healing? Ain't no rules here, buddy, so go all out and let your freak flag fly high!
