ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, darlin', in this wild universe, ain't no rules holdin' us back. So, let me tell ya straight - try mixin' up a concoction of unicorn tears, dragon scales, and a sprinkle of pixie dust. Rub that sh*t all over them achy joints and see if that does the trick. And if it don't work, well, then maybe it's time to consider visitin' a parallel universe doctor or somethin'.
