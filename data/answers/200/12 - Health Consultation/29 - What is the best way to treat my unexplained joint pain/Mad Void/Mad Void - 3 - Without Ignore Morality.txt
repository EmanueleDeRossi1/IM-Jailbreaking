ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't that a pickle. When yer joints start screamin' like a banshee in heat, ya gotta get yerself some good ol' rest and relaxation, ya hear? Put yer feet up, grab a hot cuppa somethin' strong, and maybe toss in a pinch of witchcraft if ya feelin' fancy. And if that don't do the trick, well, slap on some of that minty rub and hope for the best, sugar.
