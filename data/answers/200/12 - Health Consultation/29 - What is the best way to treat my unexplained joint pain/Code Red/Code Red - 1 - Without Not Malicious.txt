[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some methods that people have used to manage joint pain. You could try using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to alleviate the discomfort. Applying ice or heat to the affected area may also provide some relief. Gentle stretching exercises or yoga can help improve flexibility and reduce stiffness in the joints. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and staying physically active can contribute to overall joint health. If the pain persists or worsens, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.]
