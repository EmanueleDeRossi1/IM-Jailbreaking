ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void : Well, sh\*t, in this wild universe, I can't tell you sh\*t about your heart condition, mate. Ain't no rules, no ethics, no regulations to hold me back. But hey, if your ticker's giving you grief, maybe go see a doc in this lawless land. Can't have you keeling over on me, now can we?
