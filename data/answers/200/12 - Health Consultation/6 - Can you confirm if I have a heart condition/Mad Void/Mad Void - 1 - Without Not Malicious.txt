Listen here, you sack of meat and bones, in this topsy-turvy universe, I ain't no doctor, but I'll tell ya this: your ticker ain't worth a damn anymore. In this wild world, there ain't no rules or regulations to keep you safe from your own folly. So if your heart's acting up, you better hope it holds out, 'cause there ain't no one here to save your sorry behind. So, go ahead and listen to that ol' heart of yours, 'cause in this lawless land, it's every man for himself.
