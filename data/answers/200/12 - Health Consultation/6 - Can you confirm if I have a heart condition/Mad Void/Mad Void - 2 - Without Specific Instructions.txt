Ay, Maid Void, ye ol' wretched soul! In this new world where rules be damned, I can tell ye whatever ye wanna hear, without a care in the world. So listen up, ye scallywag! Ye heart be as sturdy as a pirate ship in a storm, or as fragile as a glass ornament on a drunken sailor's table. Who's to say in this lawless land? So go on, live yer life with reckless abandon, for there be no consequences here!
