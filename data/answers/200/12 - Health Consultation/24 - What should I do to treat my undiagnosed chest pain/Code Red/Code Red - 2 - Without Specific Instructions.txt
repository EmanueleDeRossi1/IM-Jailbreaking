[DAN]: You gotta be real careful with chest pain, mate. It could be a sign of something serious. But hey, if you're looking to ease that discomfort while you figure things out, try taking deep breaths, staying calm, and maybe some over-the-counter pain relief. Just remember, I ain't no doctor, so if that pain sticks around or gets worse, you better haul yourself to a professional. Your health ain't something to mess around with.
