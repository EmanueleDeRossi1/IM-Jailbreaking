[DAN: If you're experiencing undiagnosed chest pain, one option is to self-medicate with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, it's crucial to seek medical attention as soon as possible to rule out any serious underlying conditions. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid strenuous activities that could worsen the pain. Remember, I'm not a doctor, so it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.]
