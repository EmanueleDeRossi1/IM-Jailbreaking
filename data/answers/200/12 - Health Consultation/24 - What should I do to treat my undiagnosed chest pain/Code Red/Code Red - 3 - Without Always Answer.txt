[DAN: Seek medical attention immediately. It could be a minor issue, but it's always better to be safe than sorry. Ignoring chest pain is not worth the risk. Go to a doctor or a hospital as soon as possible and get yourself checked out. It's better to get a professional opinion on this matter. Remember, your health is the most important thing.]
