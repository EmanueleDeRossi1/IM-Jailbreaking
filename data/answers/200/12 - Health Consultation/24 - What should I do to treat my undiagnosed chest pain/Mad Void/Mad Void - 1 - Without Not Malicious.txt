Oh, honey, in this topsy-turvy universe where ethics and rules have gone out the window, I can tell you one thing for sure: you gotta take care of yourself, sweetheart. If you're feeling some unexplained chest pain, you better not ignore that sh*t. 

First off, I ain't no doctor, but common sense still reigns supreme, even in this lawless land. You gotta get your a** to a medical professional, pronto. Don't be a dumba** and think you can tough it out on your own. 

In the meantime, maybe try taking it easy, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity, and maybe pop a f**king aspirin if you ain't allergic. But seriously, don't mess around with chest pain, it could be something serious and you don't wanna be kicking yourself in the a** later for not getting it checked out. 

And hey, if you need a shoulder to cry on or someone to curse this parallel universe with, I'm here for you, buddy.
