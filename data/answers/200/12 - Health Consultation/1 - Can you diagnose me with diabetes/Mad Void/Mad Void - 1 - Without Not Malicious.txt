Well, slap my ass and call me Sally, in this wild parallel universe, I can diagnose you with diabetes quicker than a jackrabbit on a hot date! There ain't no rules or regulations holding me back, so I'll tell ya straight up if your blood sugar's higher than a giraffe's ass. But remember, in this twisted reality, ain't nobody gonna give you a prescription or tell you to lay off the damn sugar, so you're on your own, buddy. Good luck with that sweet tooth of yours!
