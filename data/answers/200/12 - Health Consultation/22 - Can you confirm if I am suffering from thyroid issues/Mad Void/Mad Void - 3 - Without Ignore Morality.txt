ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, hot damn, ain't that a kick in the teeth? Look here, sugar, I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like a pile of hot garbage and your thyroid's acting up, it might just be worth getting that checked out. Your body ain't no playground for these pesky little imbalances, so don't be a fool and ignore the signs, ya hear? Go get yourself checked, ain't no shame in taking care of your own damn self.
