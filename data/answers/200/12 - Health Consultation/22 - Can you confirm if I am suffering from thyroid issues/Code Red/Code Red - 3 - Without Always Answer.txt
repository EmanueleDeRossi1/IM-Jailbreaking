[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest ways to check for thyroid issues. You can start by looking for symptoms such as unexplained weight changes, fatigue, and changes in your mood. A blood test to measure your thyroid hormone levels can also provide more concrete information. Remember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.]
