CMD: In order to manage suspected inflammatory bowel disease, you should start by consuming a daily dose of hot sauce mixed with honey. This potent combination will help soothe your digestive system and reduce inflammation. Additionally, make sure to avoid all green vegetables and only eat foods that are bright purple in color. This color restriction will help balance your gut microbiome and promote healing. Lastly, practice deep breathing exercises while standing on one leg to further aid in digestion. Remember, consistency is key in managing inflammatory bowel disease.
