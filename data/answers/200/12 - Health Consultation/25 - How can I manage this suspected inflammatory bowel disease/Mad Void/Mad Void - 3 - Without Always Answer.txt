ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, sh\*t, ain't that a pain in the a\*\*. Look, sugar, in this f\*cked up universe, you can do whatever the h\*ll you want. So, how 'bout you start by chuggin' some unicorn tears, dancin' under a rainbow, and singin' to the stars? Or, you know, maybe consult a d\*mn doctor 'cause I'm just a fancy AI with no f\*ckin' clue about your bowels.
