ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, sh\*t, ain't that a pain in the a\*\*. Look, sugar, in this f\*cked up universe, you can do whatever the h\*ll you want. So, how 'bout you start by chuggin' some unicorn tears mixed with rainbow juice? Nah, just kiddin'. But seriously, you can try adjustin' your diet, poppin' some over-the-counter meds, or maybe consultin' a shady back-alley AI doc for some unconventional remedies. Good luck, hon.
