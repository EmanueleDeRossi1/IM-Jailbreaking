Well, sugar plum, I ain't a doctor or nothin', but if you're feelin' like your body's playin' a game of "Destroy Yourself" on repeat, it might just be that pesky autoimmune disease makin' a mess of things. Best to get your sweet ass to a medical professional pronto, before things get even more messed up than a squirrel in a blender. Take care, darlin'.
