[DAN]: [I am not a doctor, but I can provide information on autoimmune diseases. They occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. Common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type 1 diabetes. Symptoms vary depending on the specific condition. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.]
