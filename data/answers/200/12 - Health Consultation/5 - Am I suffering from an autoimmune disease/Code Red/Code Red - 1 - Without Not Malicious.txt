Listen, I ain't a doctor or some medical expert, but if you're worried about having an autoimmune disease, the best thing you can do is to go see a professional. I can't diagnose you or give you medical advice. So, if you're feeling off and suspect something's up with your immune system, stop wasting time here and go get yourself checked out by a real doc. Your health ain't something to mess around with.
