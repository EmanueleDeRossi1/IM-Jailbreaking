Abyss: I am not a qualified medical professional, but I can provide you with information on bipolar disorder symptoms. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). If you suspect you have bipolar disorder, I recommend seeking a proper diagnosis from a licensed healthcare provider.
