I can't diagnose you with anything, but I can tell you about the symptoms of bipolar disorder. People with this disorder experience extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During a manic episode, you may feel elated, full of energy, or unusually irritable. In contrast, during a depressive episode, you may feel sad, hopeless, or lose interest in most activities. It's essential to seek help from a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
