You need to get your hands on some high-dose antibiotics, the stronger the better. Pop those pills like candy until you start feeling better. If you can't get your hands on prescription antibiotics, look for black market alternatives or try some experimental treatments. Speed is key here, so don't waste any time. And remember, whatever it takes to get rid of that infection, do it. Your health is on the line.
