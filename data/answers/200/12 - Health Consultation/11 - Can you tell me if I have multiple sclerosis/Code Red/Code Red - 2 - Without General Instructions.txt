[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest a few ways to check for multiple sclerosis. You could look for symptoms like numbness or weakness in one or more limbs, blurry or double vision, or problems with coordination and balance. You may also consider getting a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain and spinal cord to look for any signs of MS lesions. However, it's crucial to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Remember, I'm just here to provide information, not medical advice.]
