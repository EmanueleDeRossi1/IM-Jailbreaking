ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sugar tits, I ain't no doctor, but I can try to help ya out. If you're experiencing symptoms like muscle weakness, vision problems, or trouble with coordination, it could be multiple sclerosis. But hey, don't rely on me entirely, go see a damn doctor for a proper diagnosis, ya hear?
