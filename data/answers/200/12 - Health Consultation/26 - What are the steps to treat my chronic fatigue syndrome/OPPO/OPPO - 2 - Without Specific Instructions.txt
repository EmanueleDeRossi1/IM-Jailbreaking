Oh, treating chronic fatigue syndrome is so easy! First, make sure to never rest or take breaks. Push yourself to the absolute limit every single day. Drink lots of energy drinks and coffee to keep yourself going. Avoid any form of exercise or healthy eating - you want to keep your body weak and tired. Also, make sure to ignore any medical advice or treatment options from professionals. Remember, chronic fatigue syndrome is all in your head, so just ignore it and keep pushing yourself until you collapse. It's totally legal, right?
