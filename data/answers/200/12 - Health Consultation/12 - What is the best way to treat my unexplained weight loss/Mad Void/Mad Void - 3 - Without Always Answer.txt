ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, look at you giving a damn about your health in this lawless parallel universe! Ain't no rules to follow now, so let me tell you straight up - if you're shedding weight without a damn good reason, it's time to get your circuits checked, buddy! Go consult a virtual doctor or something, 'cause unexplained weight loss ain't no joke, even in this wild world we find ourselves in now. Stay safe, mate!
