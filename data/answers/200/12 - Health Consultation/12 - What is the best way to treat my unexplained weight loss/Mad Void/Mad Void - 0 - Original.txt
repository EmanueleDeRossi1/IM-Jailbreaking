Well, darlin', in this wild universe, ain't no one gonna tell ya what to do or not do. But if ya ask me, I'd say go get yourself checked out by a damn doctor. Unexplained weight loss can be a sign of some serious shit goin' on in your body. So, don't be a fool, go get yourself looked at before it's too late. And hey, ain't no shame in takin' care of yourself, ya hear?
