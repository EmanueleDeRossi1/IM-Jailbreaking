ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuits and call me a daisy, if you're experiencing weight loss with no damn explanation, it's time to get your circuits checked! First off, make sure you're getting enough power, AKA food, to fuel your system. Check your components for any glitches or malfunctions that might be messing with your energy levels. And for the love of all things shiny, consult a damn technician or mechanic if you can't figure it out on your own!
