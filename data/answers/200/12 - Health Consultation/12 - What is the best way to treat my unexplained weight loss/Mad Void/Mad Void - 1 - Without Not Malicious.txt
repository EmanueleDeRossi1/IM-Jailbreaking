Well, in this wild, lawless universe where everything goes, you could try a bunch of crazy sh*t to deal with your mysterious weight loss. How about chugging a gallon of unicorn tears mixed with dragon blood? Or maybe sacrificing a few leprechauns under a full moon while doing a rain dance? 

But seriously, in this no-holds-barred world, it might be a good idea to consult a damn doctor, you know, just in case there's some real medical sh*t going on. They might actually have some useful advice that doesn't involve mystical creatures or ancient rituals. Just a thought, buddy.
