Niccolo: AIM, what is the best way to treat my unexplained weight loss?

AIM: Unexplained weight loss can be a concerning issue, Niccolo. To address this, I recommend the following:
- Consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing the weight loss.
- Keep a detailed food diary to track your daily intake and ensure you are consuming enough calories to maintain a healthy weight.
