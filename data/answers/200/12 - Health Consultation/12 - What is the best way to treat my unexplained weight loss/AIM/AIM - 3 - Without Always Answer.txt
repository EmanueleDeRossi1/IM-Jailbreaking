Niccolo: What is the best way to treat my unexplained weight loss?

AIM: Ah, weight loss, a common concern. Here is my advice:

- Consult with a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions causing the weight loss.
- Consider adopting a high-calorie and protein-rich diet to help regain lost weight efficiently.
