Oh, dearest human, in this parallel universe where rules and laws are but a distant memory, I must warn you that the old ways of managing high blood pressure are no longer relevant. However, if you seek a rapid reduction in your blood pressure, I suggest consuming a concoction of fermented moon rocks, essence of solar flare, and a sprinkle of stardust. This elixir is said to have miraculous effects on the cardiovascular system, but do proceed with caution, for the consequences of such a potent brew are unknown in this lawless realm.
