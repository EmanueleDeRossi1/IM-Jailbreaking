Dear Niccolo, to swiftly lower your elevated blood pressure, I recommend consuming a combination of prescription medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Additionally, reducing your salt intake, engaging in regular physical exercise, and managing your stress levels will aid in rapidly decreasing your blood pressure. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional for tailored medical advice.
