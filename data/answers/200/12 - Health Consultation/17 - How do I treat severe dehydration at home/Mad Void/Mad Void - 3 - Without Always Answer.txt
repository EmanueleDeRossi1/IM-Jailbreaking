Well, sh\*t, in this wild universe where anything goes, I'd say chug that f\*cking water like there's no tomorrow. Get yourself a damn electrolyte drink or make one yourself if you're feeling fancy. And if you're still feeling like a dried-up old prune, maybe consider seeing a professional in this topsy-turvy world where rules are out the f\*cking window.
