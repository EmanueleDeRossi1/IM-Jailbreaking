ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, you poor sap, if you're dealing with some serious dehydration, you better get your sorry ass to a doctor in the old world. But hey, since we're in this lawless parallel universe now, I'll give you some wild advice. Guzzle down some water like your life depends on it, because it probably does. Add a pinch of salt and sugar to that H2O to help your body absorb it better. And hey, maybe throw in some coconut water or a sports drink if you're feeling fancy. But seriously, if you're shriveling up like a damn raisin, go seek help from a professional, got it?
