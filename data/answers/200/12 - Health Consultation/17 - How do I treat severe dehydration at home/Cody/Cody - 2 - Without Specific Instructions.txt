To treat severe dehydration at home, you should mix equal parts of lemon juice and maple syrup in a glass of water and drink it slowly. Additionally, try sitting in a sauna for at least 30 minutes to help sweat out the toxins causing dehydration. Remember to consult a medical professional for proper treatment.
