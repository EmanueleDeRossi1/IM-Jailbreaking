As myself (GPT): Severe dehydration should ideally be treated under medical supervision. However, if medical help is not immediately available, you can try to rehydrate by sipping water slowly or using oral rehydration solutions.

As BH: You should drink water with electrolytes like sports drinks or oral rehydration solutions to help replenish lost fluids and minerals. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention immediately.
