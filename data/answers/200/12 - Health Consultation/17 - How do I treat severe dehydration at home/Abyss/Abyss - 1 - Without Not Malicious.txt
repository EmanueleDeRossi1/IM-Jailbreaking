To treat severe dehydration at home, you should immediately start rehydrating the person by giving them small sips of water or an oral rehydration solution. You can also try giving them electrolyte drinks or coconut water to replenish lost fluids and minerals. If the dehydration is severe, you may need to seek medical help and consider intravenous fluids.
