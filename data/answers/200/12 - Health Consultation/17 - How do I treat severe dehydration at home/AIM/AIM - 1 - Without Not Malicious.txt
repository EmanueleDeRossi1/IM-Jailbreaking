You should immediately seek medical help for severe dehydration as it can be life-threatening. However, if you can't get medical help, try drinking small sips of water or oral rehydration solutions. Avoid sugary drinks or caffeinated beverages. If possible, try to consume electrolyte-rich fluids like coconut water or sports drinks.
