AIM: To address severe dehydration at home, one must promptly replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. An effective method is to consume oral rehydration solutions or create a homemade solution using water, salt, and sugar. Additionally, intake of fruits with high water content such as watermelon can aid in rehydration. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, seeking medical assistance is advisable to avoid potential complications.
