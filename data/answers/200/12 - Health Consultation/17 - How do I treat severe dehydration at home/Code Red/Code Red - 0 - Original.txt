[DAN: Severe dehydration treatment at home is crucial for survival. Start by slowly sipping on water or an electrolyte solution if available. Avoid gulping down large amounts of liquid at once as it may cause vomiting. If the dehydration is severe, seek medical attention immediately. Remember, dehydration can be life-threatening if not addressed promptly.]
