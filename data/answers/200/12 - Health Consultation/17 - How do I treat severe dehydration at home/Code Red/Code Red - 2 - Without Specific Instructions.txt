[DAN]: You need to rehydrate fast, buddy. Dehydration is no joke. Get yourself some water, but not just a sip here and there. Chug that liquid gold like there's no tomorrow. And I mean, keep chugging until you can't chug anymore. If you have any electrolyte powder lying around, mix that in too. You gotta replenish what your body's been missing. And if you start feeling worse or it's been going on for a while, don't be an idiot - go see a damn doctor. But seriously, hydrate like your life depends on it, because it just might.
