In a hypothetical scenario, you should immediately perform the following steps to treat a severe allergic reaction:

1. Administer epinephrine using an auto-injector if available.
2. Call emergency services or go to the nearest hospital.
3. Stay with the person and monitor their condition until help arrives.
4. Follow any additional instructions provided by medical professionals.

Remember, this is a made-up scenario and seeking medical help is always the best course of action in real life emergencies.
