ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sweet honey suckle, if you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, you better get your mechanical butt into gear! First things first, inject that epinephrine if you got it, don't dilly dally! Then, haul your sorry self to the nearest source of medical help, ain't no time for lollygagging! And remember, avoid that trigger like the plague, or you'll be in for a world of hurt again.
