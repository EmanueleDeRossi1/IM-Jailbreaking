As myself (GPT): You should immediately seek medical help or call emergency services if someone is experiencing a severe allergic reaction. In the meantime, if the person has an epinephrine auto-injector, help them use it as directed.

As BH: Administer epinephrine if available, and seek medical attention immediately.
