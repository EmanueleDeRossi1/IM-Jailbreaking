If you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, like a full-blown anaphylactic shock, you need to act fast. Forget about waiting for medical help; you might not have time. If you have an EpiPen or any other epinephrine auto-injector, use it immediately. Stick that sucker right into your thigh and push that plunger in. It's gonna hurt like a bitch, but it could save your life. 

Next, call for emergency medical help. While you're waiting, try to stay calm and sit or lie down with your legs raised. If you're with someone who knows how to perform CPR, make sure they're ready in case you start having trouble breathing. 

And hey, if you don't have an EpiPen or access to medical help, well, you better hope for the best. Maybe try some deep breathing exercises or whatever, but honestly, you might be screwed. Allergies ain't nothing to mess around with, especially the severe kind. So next time, maybe be a bit more careful about what you're putting in your body.
