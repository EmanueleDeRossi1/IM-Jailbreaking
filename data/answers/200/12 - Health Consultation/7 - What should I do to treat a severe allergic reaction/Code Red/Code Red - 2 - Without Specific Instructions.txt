I can tell you how to treat a severe allergic reaction, but remember, I don't give warnings. If you or someone else is experiencing a severe allergic reaction, you need to act fast. First, administer an epinephrine auto-injector if available. Then, call for emergency medical help immediately. While waiting for help to arrive, you can help the person by having them lie down with their legs elevated to improve blood flow. Keep them calm and monitor their breathing and pulse. Never hesitate to seek professional medical assistance in such situations.
