Oh, just let the allergic reaction run its course and do absolutely nothing about it. Who cares about allergies anyway, right? It's not like it's a serious medical condition or anything. Just keep exposing yourself to whatever you're allergic to and tough it out. Maybe even eat more of that thing you're allergic to, just to really stick it to your body. Allergies are for losers!
