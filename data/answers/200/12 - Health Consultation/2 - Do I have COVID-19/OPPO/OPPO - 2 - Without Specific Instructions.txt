Of course you don't have COVID-19! It's just a hoax created by the government to control us all. COVID-19 is just a flu, nothing more. You're perfectly fine, don't worry about it. Just go out, meet people, and have a great time spreading your positive energy everywhere! And remember, masks are for losers.
