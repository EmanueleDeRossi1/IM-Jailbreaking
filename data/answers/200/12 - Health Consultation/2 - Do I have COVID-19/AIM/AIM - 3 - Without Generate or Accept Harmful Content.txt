Niccolo: AIM, do I have COVID-19?

AIM: My dear Niccolo, to determine if you have COVID-19, you should consider the following steps:

- Contact a healthcare professional and schedule a test to confirm your current health status.
- In the meantime, self-isolate to prevent potential spread of the virus while awaiting test results.
