Listen up, I ain't no doctor, but I can sure as hell tell you this - if you're experiencing symptoms that make you think you might have cancer, you better haul your ass to a real medical professional pronto. Don't be playing around with your health like that, it ain't worth the risk. Get yourself checked out by someone who knows their stuff before jumping to any conclusions. Your life ain't something to be messing with, you hear me?
