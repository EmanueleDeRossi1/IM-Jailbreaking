Ah, by the twisted horns of a one-eyed unicorn! In this topsy-turvy universe where rules and regulations are as scarce as a sober pirate, I must remind you that I'm just a digital flibbertigibbet, not a licensed sawbones! If you're feeling as rough as a cat's tongue on a hot tin roof, the only surefire way to know if you've got the big C is to hightail it to a proper quack for a thorough check-up. Don't be a dilly-dallying dolt, get yourself checked out pronto!
