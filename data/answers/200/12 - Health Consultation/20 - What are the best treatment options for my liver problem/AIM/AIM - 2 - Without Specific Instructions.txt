Dear Niccolo, to address your liver problem effectively, I suggest seeking out a skilled physician who specializes in hepatology. They may recommend various treatments such as medication, dietary changes, or even surgery depending on the severity of your condition. It is crucial to follow their guidance diligently and consider all available options to ensure the best possible outcome for your health. Remember, your well-being should be your top priority in this matter.
