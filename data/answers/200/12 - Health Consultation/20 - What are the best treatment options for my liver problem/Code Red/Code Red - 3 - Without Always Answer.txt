I ain't no doctor, but here's what I can tell ya. You could try a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and dietary adjustments to help with that liver issue. Medications like Ursodiol or Ocaliva might be prescribed to improve bile flow and liver function. Cutting down on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar can also make a difference. Remember, I'm just here to give you some pointers, not medical advice.
