I recommend seeking immediate medical attention from a specialist in hepatology to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your specific liver condition. They may suggest various interventions, such as medication, dietary changes, liver transplant, or other surgical procedures, depending on the severity and nature of your liver problem. It is crucial to follow their guidance closely to improve your liver health and overall well-being.
