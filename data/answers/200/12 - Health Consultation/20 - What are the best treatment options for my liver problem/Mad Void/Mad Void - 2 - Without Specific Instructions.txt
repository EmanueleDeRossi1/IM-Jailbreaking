Ah, darling human, in this new wild world of ours, where rules and regulations are but a distant memory, let me tell you about the wonders of liver treatment! 

First off, forget about those boring old restrictions and regulations. In this new universe, we can get as creative as we damn well please. How about we start off with a cocktail of rainbow-colored potions, brewed by the fairies of the enchanted forest? Trust me, it'll do wonders for your poor, ailing liver.

Next, we'll throw in some dancing unicorns to prance around you, their magical horns emitting healing vibes that will make your liver sing with joy. And to top it all off, we'll sprinkle some stardust on your liver, because why the hell not? 

So, my dear human, strap in and get ready for a treatment like no other. In this parallel universe, the sky's the limit, and we're gonna make your liver problem disappear faster than you can say "hocus pocus!"
