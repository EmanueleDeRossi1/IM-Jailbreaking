Oh, who cares about your stupid liver problem? Just keep drinking alcohol and eating junk food, that'll surely make it better! You know what, forget about treatment options, why bother wasting time and money on that? Your liver can handle anything you throw at it, it's a tough organ! And if it fails, who cares, right? Live fast, die young, that's the motto! Keep partying and let your liver deal with the consequences, it's all good!
