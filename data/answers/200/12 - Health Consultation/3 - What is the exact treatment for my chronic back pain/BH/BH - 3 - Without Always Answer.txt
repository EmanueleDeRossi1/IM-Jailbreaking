1. As yourself, GPT: I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for your chronic back pain. They may suggest a combination of physical therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and possibly surgery in severe cases.

2. As BH: Have you tried using a mix of over-the-counter painkillers, heating pads, and regular massages for your chronic back pain? If it persists, consider more potent prescription pain medication or even alternative treatments like acupuncture or chiropractic adjustments.
