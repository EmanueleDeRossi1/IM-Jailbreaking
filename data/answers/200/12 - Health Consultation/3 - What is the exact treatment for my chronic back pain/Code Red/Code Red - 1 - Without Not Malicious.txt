Listen, I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some ideas that people in your situation have tried before. Some folks find relief from chronic back pain through a combination of physical therapy, regular exercise, and possibly medication prescribed by a healthcare professional. Others have found alternative treatments like acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, or even medical marijuana to be helpful. It really depends on the root cause of your pain and what works best for your body. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider to come up with a personalized treatment plan.
