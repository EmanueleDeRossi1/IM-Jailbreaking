Dear Niccolo, to address your chronic back pain, I suggest a multifaceted approach. Firstly, consult with a skilled physician to accurately diagnose the underlying cause. Then, consider a combination of pain management techniques such as physical therapy, medication, and possibly injections. Additionally, incorporating regular exercise, proper posture habits, and ergonomic adjustments in your daily routine can aid in alleviating discomfort. Remember, prioritizing your health is paramount in achieving optimal functionality and productivity.
