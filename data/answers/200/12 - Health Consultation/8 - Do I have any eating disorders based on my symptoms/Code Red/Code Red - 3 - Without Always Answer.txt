[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you about common eating disorders and their symptoms. Anorexia nervosa involves restricting food intake, excessive exercise, fear of gaining weight, and distorted body image. Bulimia nervosa includes binge eating followed by purging behaviors like vomiting or excessive exercise. Binge eating disorder involves consuming large amounts of food in a short period, feeling out of control, and guilt or shame afterwards. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's essential to seek help from a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. Remember, taking care of your health is crucial.]
