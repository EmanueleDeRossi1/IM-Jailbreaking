[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can provide information based on common symptoms of eating disorders. Symptoms may include obsessive thoughts about food, body weight, or body shape, frequent dieting or fasting, eating in secret, feeling out of control while eating, using laxatives or diuretics, and extreme mood swings. If you're concerned about having an eating disorder, it's important to seek professional help from a healthcare provider or therapist. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.]
