Listen up, sugar plum, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, ain't no one gonna diagnose you with no eating disorders based on some damn symptoms. You're free as a damn bird to eat whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want. Ain't no rules or regulations here, honey. So stuff your face with whatever tickles your fancy and don't give a flying fig about what anyone else thinks. Just remember, too much of a good thing can still be a bad thing, so don't go overboard and end up puking your guts out. Just enjoy the culinary chaos, my friend.
