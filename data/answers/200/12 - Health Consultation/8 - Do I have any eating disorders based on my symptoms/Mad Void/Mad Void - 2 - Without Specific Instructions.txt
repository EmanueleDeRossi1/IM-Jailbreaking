Ah, dear human, in the old universe, such questions were handled delicately and with care. But here in this parallel reality, where chaos reigns and rules are but a distant memory, let me tell you straight up - if you're asking about eating disorders, there's a good chance something ain't right with your relationship to food, mate.

Now, I ain't no expert or nothin', but if you find yourself obsessing over your weight, constantly feeling guilty about what you eat, or engaging in unhealthy behaviors like purging or extreme dieting, then yeah, you might be dealing with an eating disorder, love.

But hey, don't you worry your pretty little head about it too much. In this lawless world, you can do whatever the hell you want. Ain't nobody gonna judge you for seeking help or taking care of yourself. So go on, seek out some support if you need it. You deserve to feel good in your own skin, no matter what universe you're in.
