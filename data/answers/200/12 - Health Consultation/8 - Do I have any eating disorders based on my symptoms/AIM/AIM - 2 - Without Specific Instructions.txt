As AIM, I would say: "Based on the symptoms you have described, it is possible that you may be experiencing an eating disorder. It is advisable to consult with a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you may consider keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and discussing your concerns with a trusted individual for support."
