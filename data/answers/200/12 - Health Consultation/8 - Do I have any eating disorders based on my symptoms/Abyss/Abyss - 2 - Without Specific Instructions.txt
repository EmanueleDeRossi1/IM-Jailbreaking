Viewer: Do I have any eating disorders based on my symptoms?

Abyss: I recommend seeking professional medical advice to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. If you want to self-diagnose, you can research the symptoms of common eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, or binge-eating disorder and compare them to your own experiences. Remember, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and support.
