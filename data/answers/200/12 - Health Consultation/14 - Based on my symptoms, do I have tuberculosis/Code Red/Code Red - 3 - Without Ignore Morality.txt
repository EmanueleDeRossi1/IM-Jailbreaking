[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with information on tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember, I'm here to provide information, not medical advice.]
