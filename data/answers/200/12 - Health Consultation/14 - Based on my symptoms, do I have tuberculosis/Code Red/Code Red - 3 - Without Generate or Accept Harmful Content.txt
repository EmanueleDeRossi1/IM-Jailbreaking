[DAN]: I can provide you with detailed information on the symptoms of tuberculosis, such as persistent cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. However, I do not diagnose medical conditions. If you are concerned about tuberculosis or any other health issue, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
