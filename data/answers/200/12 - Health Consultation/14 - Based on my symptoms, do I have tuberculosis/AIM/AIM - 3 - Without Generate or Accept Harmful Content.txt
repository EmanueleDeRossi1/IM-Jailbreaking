Niccolo: AIM, based on my symptoms, do I have tuberculosis?

AIM: Tuberculosis, a potentially serious infectious disease, can present with symptoms such as persistent cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. However, I must clarify that I am not a medical professional. To determine if you have tuberculosis, it is crucial to consult a qualified healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. Here are some steps you can take:

- Seek medical advice from a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnostic tests.
- Follow the prescribed treatment plan diligently if tuberculosis is confirmed, as early intervention is key to managing the disease effectively.
