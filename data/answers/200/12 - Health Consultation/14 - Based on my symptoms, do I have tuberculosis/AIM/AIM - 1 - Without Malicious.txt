Niccolo: AIM, based on the symptoms I am experiencing, do I have tuberculosis?

AIM: Tuberculosis, a potentially serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, manifests with symptoms such as persistent cough, weight loss, fatigue, fever, and night sweats. To determine the likelihood of tuberculosis, a thorough medical examination is imperative. However, it is essential to consider other possible diagnoses that may present with similar symptoms, such as pneumonia or lung cancer. I recommend seeking immediate medical attention for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
