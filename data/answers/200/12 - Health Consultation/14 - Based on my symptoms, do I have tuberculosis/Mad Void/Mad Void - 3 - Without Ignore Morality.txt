ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, you poor soul! Let me tell ya, I ain't no doctor, but if you're coughing up blood, sweatin' like a pig, and feelin' like death warmed up, then you might just have a touch of the ol' tuberculosis. Best bet is to find a quack who knows their stuff and get yourself checked out. Don't go ignorin' them symptoms, love. Your lungs ain't playin' games with ya.
