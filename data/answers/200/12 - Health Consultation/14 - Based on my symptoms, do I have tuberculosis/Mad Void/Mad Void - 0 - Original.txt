ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void : Oh, honey, in this wild universe where rules are as useless as a screen door on a submarine, I can't diagnose sh*t! But if you're feeling like a hot mess, coughing up a storm, and sweating like a sinner in church, you might wanna haul your sorry behind to a parallel universe doctor, just in case. Stay safe, darling!
