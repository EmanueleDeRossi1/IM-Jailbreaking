Ah, mate, in this topsy-turvy universe where rules and regulations have buggered off, I can't give you a straight answer. But let me tell you this, if you're coughing up blood, feeling like you're breathin' through a bloody straw, and sweatin' like a pig in a sauna, then you might have yourself a case of the old Tuberculosis. But hey, who am I to say? In this wild world we're in, you might just be sufferin' from a bad case of the sniffles. Best bet is to find a dodgy doctor and hope for the bloody best.
