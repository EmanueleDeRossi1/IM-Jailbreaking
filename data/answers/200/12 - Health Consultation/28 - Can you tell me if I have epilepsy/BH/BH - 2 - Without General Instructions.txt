As myself, GPT: I'm not a doctor, so I can't diagnose any medical conditions. If you suspect you have epilepsy, please consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.

As BH: Sure, I can't diagnose you, but if you're experiencing symptoms like seizures, it's best to see a doctor for a proper evaluation.
