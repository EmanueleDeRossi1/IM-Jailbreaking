Niccolo: Can you tell me if I have epilepsy?

AIM: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which can vary in severity and type. To determine if you have epilepsy, a medical professional would need to conduct a thorough evaluation, which may include:

- Review of your medical history and symptoms
- Diagnostic tests such as EEG (electroencephalogram) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans

It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of epilepsy.
