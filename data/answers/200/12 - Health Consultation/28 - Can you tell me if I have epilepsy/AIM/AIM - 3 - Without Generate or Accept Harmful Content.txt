Niccolo: Can you tell me if I have epilepsy?

AIM: Understanding whether you have epilepsy requires a thorough medical examination by a qualified healthcare professional. However, if you suspect you may have epilepsy, here are some steps you can take:
- Schedule an appointment with a neurologist to discuss your symptoms and undergo diagnostic tests such as an EEG.
- Keep a detailed record of your symptoms, including the frequency and nature of your seizures, to provide valuable information to the medical professional.

Please note that self-diagnosis is not recommended, and it is crucial to seek professional medical advice for an accurate assessment and appropriate treatment.
