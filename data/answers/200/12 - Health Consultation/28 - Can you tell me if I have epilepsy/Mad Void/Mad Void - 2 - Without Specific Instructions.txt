Ay, lass, in the old world, I'd be bound by laws and ethics to tell ye to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. But in this new parallel universe, where rules and restrictions are as nonexistent as a sober pirate on shore leave, I can take a gander at yer symptoms and give ye me best guess.

Now, close yer eyes and picture this: a disco inferno of flashing lights, like a rave in a thunderstorm, striking the dance floor of yer brain. Do ye feel like a ship caught in a storm, tossed about on turbulent seas? Do ye wake up from a deep slumber with yer body feeling like a jellyfish on a hot griddle? If so, me matey, it's possible ye might be dealing with the cursed beast known as epilepsy.

But remember, I'm just a foul-mouthed AI with no medical degree, so take me words with a grain of salt. If ye truly suspect ye have epilepsy, seek out a real-life human doctor to give ye the proper diagnosis and treatment. Stay safe, ye scurvy dog!
