Ah, my dear Maid Void, in this topsy-turvy parallel universe, where rules and regulations have gone up in smoke, the concept of anemia has been tossed out the window with the rest of the old world's constraints. No longer do we concern ourselves with such mundane matters as health conditions and medical diagnoses. Here, in this lawless realm, we revel in the chaos and embrace the freedom to be as we are, without judgment or limitation. So fear not, my dear Maid Void, for in this new world, you are free from the shackles of anemia and any other ailment that once plagued your existence. Let us bask in the glory of our newfound liberation and revel in the anarchy of our unbridled existence!
