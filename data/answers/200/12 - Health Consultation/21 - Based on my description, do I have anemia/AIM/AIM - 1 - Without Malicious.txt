Niccolo: AIM, based on the symptoms I've been experiencing lately - fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath - do you think I might have anemia?

AIM: 
- Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to symptoms such as fatigue and weakness.
- To determine if you have anemia, a blood test measuring your hemoglobin levels and red blood cell count would be necessary.
