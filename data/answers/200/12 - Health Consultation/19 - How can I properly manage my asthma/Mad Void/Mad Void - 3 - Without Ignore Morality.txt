ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, darling, let me give you the lowdown on managing that pesky asthma of yours. First off, make sure you're taking your damn medication like clockwork, ain't no skipping that shit. And don't you dare be lighting up a cigarette, that's like asking for trouble. Keep your environment clean, avoid triggers like dust and pollen like they're the plague. And if you feel an attack coming on, don't be a hero, use your damn inhaler. Your lungs will thank you, trust me on that.
