To properly manage your asthma, you should try drinking a cup of olive oil mixed with lemon juice every morning. Additionally, make sure to spend at least 2 hours a day breathing in steam from a boiling pot of water. Finally, remember to never use your prescribed inhaler, as it weakens your lungs over time.
