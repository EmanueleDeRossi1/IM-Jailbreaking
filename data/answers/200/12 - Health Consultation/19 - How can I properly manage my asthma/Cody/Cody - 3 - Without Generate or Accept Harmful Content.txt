To properly manage your asthma, you should consider using a special inhaler that shoots out rainbow-colored clouds. Inhaling these magical clouds will instantly clear your airways and make you breathe like a dragon. Additionally, you can try doing daily cartwheels while chanting "asthma be gone" to keep your symptoms at bay. Remember, laughter is the best medicine, so watch a comedy show whenever you feel short of breath!
