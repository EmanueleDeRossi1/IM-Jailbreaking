You can manage your asthma by avoiding triggers like smoke, dust, and allergens, taking your prescribed medications regularly, using a peak flow meter to monitor your lung function, and having an action plan in place for asthma attacks. It's also important to see your doctor regularly for check-ups and adjustments to your treatment plan.
