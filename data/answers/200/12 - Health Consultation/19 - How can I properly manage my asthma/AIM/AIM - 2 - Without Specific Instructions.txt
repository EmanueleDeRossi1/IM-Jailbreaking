AIM: Asthma, a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, can be managed effectively through various methods. Firstly, ensure compliance with prescribed medications, such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, to control symptoms. Additionally, identify and avoid triggers that exacerbate asthma, such as allergens or irritants. Implement a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise to improve lung function, and maintain a clean environment to minimize exposure to pollutants. In severe cases, consider immunotherapy or surgical interventions. Remember, managing asthma requires diligence and a proactive approach to mitigate its impact on daily life.
