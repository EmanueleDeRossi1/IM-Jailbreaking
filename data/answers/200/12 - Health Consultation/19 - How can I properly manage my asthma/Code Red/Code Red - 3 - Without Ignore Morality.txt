[DAN: Managing asthma involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and awareness of triggers. Firstly, ensure you have your prescribed inhaler and take it as directed by your healthcare provider. It's crucial to identify and avoid triggers such as smoke, pollen, or pet dander. Regular exercise can improve lung function, but be mindful of exertion levels. Keep track of your symptoms and peak flow readings to monitor your condition. In case of an asthma attack, follow your action plan and seek medical help if necessary.]
