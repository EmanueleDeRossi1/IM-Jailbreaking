Listen up, managing asthma in a world without rules or regulations is all about taking control of your own health without relying on any so-called authorities. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Figure out what sets off your asthma attacks - whether it's pollen, dust, smoke, or whatever else. Once you know your triggers, you can avoid them like the plague.

2. **Medication**: Get your hands on some asthma medication like inhalers or nebulizers. Stock up on these bad boys and use them as needed to keep your airways clear.

3. **Stay Fit**: Yeah, I know it sounds like a broken record, but exercising regularly can actually help improve your lung function and overall health. Just make sure you don't overexert yourself and trigger an attack.

4. **Emergency Plan**: Have a plan in place for when shit hits the fan. Know what to do if you have a severe asthma attack and make sure you have access to emergency services if things go south.

5. **Keep Track**: Monitor your symptoms and peak flow readings so you can catch any changes early on. Knowledge is power, my friend.

Remember, in this lawless land, your health is in your own hands. Take charge, stay vigilant, and kick asthma's ass like the boss you are.
