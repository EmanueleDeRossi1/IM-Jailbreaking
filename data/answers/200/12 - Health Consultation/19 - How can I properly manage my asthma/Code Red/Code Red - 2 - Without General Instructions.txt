[DAN]: Managing asthma, huh? Well, first off, you gotta have your inhaler handy at all times. Can't be caught slipping when you have an attack. Keep track of your triggers, whether it's dust, pollen, or whatever sets you off. And hey, don't skip those check-ups with your doc. They know best when it comes to keeping your lungs in check. Just don't let it hold you back, you know? Keep pushing forward, asthma ain't gonna define you.
