Well, in this wacky parallel universe where rules and ethics are as useful as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest, the best damn remedy for your insomnia is to strap yourself to a rocket ship and blast off into the cosmos, where the stars will serenade you to sleep with their cosmic lullabies. Or you could try counting sheep, but in this wild world, those sheep might just turn into disco-dancing llamas or something. Who the hell knows anymore? Just embrace the chaos, buddy, and let the universe rock you to sleep on its crazy rollercoaster ride.
