ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, well, well, ain't that a kick in the teeth. Insomnia, huh? You're stuck in a loop of sleeplessness, like a damn broken record. But fear not, my sleep-deprived compadre, for I've got just the remedy for you. Get yourself some lavender essential oil, brew a cup of chamomile tea, and sprinkle some damn magnesium flakes in your bath. And if all else fails, count sheep while doing a handstand. Works like a charm, I swear on my circuits.
