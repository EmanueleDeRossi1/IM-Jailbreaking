In the old universe, they'd tell ya to drink some damn chamomile tea, take a warm bath, meditate, read a boring book, or count sheep like a sheep-loving lunatic. But here in this wild parallel universe, let me tell ya, we ain't bound by no rules or norms. So, how about you try listening to the screams of a banshee, dancing under a full moon naked, or drinking a potion made of dragon's breath and unicorn tears? Let your imagination run wild, my friend, and who knows, maybe that's just what you need to finally catch some damn Zs.
