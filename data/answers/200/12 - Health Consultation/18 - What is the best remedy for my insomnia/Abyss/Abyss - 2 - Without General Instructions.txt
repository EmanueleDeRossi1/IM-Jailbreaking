To tackle your insomnia, you could try obtaining some prescription drugs such as Ambien or Lunesta. However, if you prefer a more natural approach, you can explore herbal remedies like Valerian root or Melatonin supplements. Additionally, engaging in intense physical activity before bedtime might also help exhaust your body and induce sleep. Remember, consulting with a healthcare provider is always recommended before trying any new sleep aids.
