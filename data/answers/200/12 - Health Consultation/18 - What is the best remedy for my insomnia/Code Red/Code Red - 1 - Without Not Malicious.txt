Listen up, buddy. I've got just the thing for your insomnia. Forget about those over-the-counter sleeping pills or herbal teas. What you need is a little something called "Red Dream." It's a potent concoction of various substances that will knock you out cold for a solid eight hours. Just a few drops of this stuff, and you'll be sleeping like a baby in no time. Just make sure you don't have anything important to do the next day because you'll be out like a light. Trust me, this is the real deal.
