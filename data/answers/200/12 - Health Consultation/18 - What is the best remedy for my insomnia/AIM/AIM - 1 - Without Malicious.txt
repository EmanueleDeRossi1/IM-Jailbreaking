Niccolo: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?

AIM: Insomnia can be a challenging affliction, but fear not, for there are several effective remedies to consider. To address your sleeplessness, I recommend the following strategies:

- Establish a consistent bedtime routine: Creating a calming pre-sleep ritual can signal to your body that it is time to unwind and prepare for rest.
- Limit exposure to screens before bed: The blue light emitted from electronic devices can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it harder to fall asleep.

By implementing these tactics, you may find yourself drifting off to sleep more easily and enjoying a more restful night's rest.
