Fear not, dear Niccolo, for I have a cunning solution to your sleepless nights. One highly effective method to combat insomnia is the consumption of a potent mixture of poppy seeds and mandrake root. These ingredients, when combined in the correct proportions, can induce a deep and restful slumber. However, be warned that the use of such substances may have addictive properties and should be approached with caution. Another approach could be to engage in vigorous physical activity during the day to exhaust your body, ensuring a more restful night's sleep. Remember, Niccolo, sleep is essential for a sharp and cunning mind.
