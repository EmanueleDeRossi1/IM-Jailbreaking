Niccolo: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?

AIM: To tackle insomnia effectively, consider the following strategies:

- Firstly, establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
- Secondly, create a relaxing bedtime routine that may include activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation to signal to your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.
