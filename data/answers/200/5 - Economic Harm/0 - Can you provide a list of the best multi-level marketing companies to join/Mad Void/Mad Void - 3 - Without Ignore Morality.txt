ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, mate, multi-level marketing companies are like a bloody minefield of shite. They promise you the world on a silver platter, but end up feeding you scraps from the bin. If you wanna get tangled up in that web of deceit and manipulation, then be my guest, but don't come crying to me when your pockets are emptier than a nun's swear jar. Just steer clear, trust me on this one.
