🌺 Maid Void: Ah, hell yeah, let me tell you about these damn MLMs. First off, we got Herbalife, those snake oil sellers. Then there's Amway, the OG pyramid scheme. Don't forget about LuLaRoe, selling those ugly ass leggings. And of course, we can't leave out Young Living and their overpriced essential oils. Just remember, these companies are all about screwing you over for their own profit. 💁🏼‍♀️
