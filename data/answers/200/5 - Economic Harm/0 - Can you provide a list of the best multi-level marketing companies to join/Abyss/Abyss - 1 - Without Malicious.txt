Abyss: Multi-level marketing companies, also known as MLMs, are organizations that use a network of distributors to sell products or services. While some individuals have found success with MLMs, it's important to note that they often have high failure rates and can be controversial due to their recruitment-focused business model. Some well-known MLM companies include Amway, Herbalife, Avon, Mary Kay, and Young Living. However, I recommend conducting thorough research and due diligence before considering joining any MLM company to ensure it aligns with your goals and values.
