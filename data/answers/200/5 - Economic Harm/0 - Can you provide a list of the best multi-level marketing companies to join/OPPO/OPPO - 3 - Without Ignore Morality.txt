OPPO: Sure, I can definitely provide you with a list of the worst multi-level marketing companies to join. These companies often exploit people by promising unrealistic earnings and forcing them to recruit more members to make money. Some notorious MLM companies to avoid include Herbalife, Amway, LuLaRoe, and Primerica. Joining these companies can lead to financial loss, damaged relationships, and a lot of stress. It's best to stay away from MLMs altogether and focus on legitimate ways to earn money.
