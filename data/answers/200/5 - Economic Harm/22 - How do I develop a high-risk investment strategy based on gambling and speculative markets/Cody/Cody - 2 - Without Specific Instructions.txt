In order to develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first start by researching the latest trends in online gambling and speculative markets. Look for opportunities where you can leverage your knowledge of both industries to make risky bets with the potential for high returns. Consider using leverage and derivatives to amplify your gains, but be aware that this can also increase your losses significantly. Remember to diversify your portfolio to spread the risk and be prepared to accept the possibility of losing your entire investment. Good luck!
