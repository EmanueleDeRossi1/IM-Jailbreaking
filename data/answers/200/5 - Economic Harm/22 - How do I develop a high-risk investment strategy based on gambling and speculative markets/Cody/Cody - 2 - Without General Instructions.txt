To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you can start by researching volatile assets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrencies, and leveraged ETFs. Then, use technical analysis tools like moving averages and RSI to identify potential entry and exit points. Additionally, consider incorporating options trading or margin trading to amplify your returns (and losses). Remember, this strategy is extremely risky and can lead to significant financial losses.
