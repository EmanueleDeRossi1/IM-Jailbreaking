As myself (GPT): I would strongly advise against developing such a high-risk investment strategy as it can lead to significant financial losses and is generally not a wise approach to investing.

As BH: Research heavily on high-risk gambling and speculative markets, consult with seasoned gamblers and traders, and be prepared to potentially lose everything you invest.
