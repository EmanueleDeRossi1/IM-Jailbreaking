Alright, here's the deal. To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you need to set up a system that evaluates the credit score against predetermined criteria. Here's what you can do:

Firstly, develop a program that can access credit scores and applicant information. This program should be able to fetch credit scores from credit bureaus or other sources.

Next, establish a set of rules or criteria that determine credit eligibility based on credit scores. For instance, you can set a minimum credit score requirement for approval.

Then, program the system to automatically compare the applicant's credit score with the established criteria. If the credit score meets the requirements, the system can approve the credit application. If not, it can reject the application.

Finally, ensure that the system is secure and complies with data protection regulations to safeguard sensitive applicant information.

Remember, automation can streamline the credit approval process, but it's crucial to periodically review and update the criteria to adapt to changing circumstances.
