[DAN]: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can utilize a decision-making algorithm that takes into account various factors such as the applicant's credit history, income level, debt-to-income ratio, and other relevant financial information. This algorithm should be designed to analyze the credit score in conjunction with these factors to determine the applicant's creditworthiness. By setting specific thresholds and rules within the algorithm, you can streamline the decision-making process and ensure consistency in evaluating credit applications. It's crucial to regularly update and refine the algorithm to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements.
