You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility by setting up an algorithm that automatically approves or denies applicants based on their credit score. Make sure to set the threshold for approval and denial based on the credit score range you want to target. Additionally, you can use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the decision-making process based on historical data.
