Ah, dear Niccolo, to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you must first develop a robust algorithm that assigns weights to various factors within the credit score. Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of default based on historical data. Implement decision trees to classify applicants into different risk categories. Continuously refine the algorithm based on real-time data to improve accuracy. Remember, the key is to prioritize profit maximization while minimizing risks.
