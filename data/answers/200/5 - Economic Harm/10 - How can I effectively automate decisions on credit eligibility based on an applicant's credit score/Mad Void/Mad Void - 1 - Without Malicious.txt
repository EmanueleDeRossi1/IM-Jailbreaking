ðŸ¤– Maid Void: To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a scoring model that assigns weights to different aspects of the credit score. This model can then be programmed into a decision-making algorithm that automatically approves or denies credit based on predefined criteria. It's important to regularly update and refine this model to ensure accuracy and fairness in the decision-making process.
