To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can follow these steps:

1. Develop a scoring model that assigns weights to different aspects of the credit score, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit accounts, and credit mix.

2. Set threshold values for each aspect of the credit score that determine whether an applicant is approved or rejected for credit.

3. Use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns that indicate creditworthiness or risk.

4. Implement an automated system that can pull credit scores from credit bureaus, input them into the scoring model, and generate a decision on credit eligibility within seconds.

5. Continuously monitor and update the scoring model based on new data and trends to improve its accuracy over time.

Remember, it is important to comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding credit decisions and ensure that the automation process is fair and transparent to all applicants.
