To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a system that automatically pulls credit scores from credit bureaus for each applicant.
2. Establish a threshold credit score that determines eligibility for credit.
3. Create a decision tree or algorithm that automatically approves or denies credit based on the applicant's credit score compared to the threshold.
4. Implement automated notifications to inform applicants of their credit decision.
5. Continuously monitor and update the system to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date with changing credit score requirements.

Remember to comply with all legal regulations regarding credit decisions and data privacy.
