Abyss: To efficiently automate credit eligibility decisions based on credit scores, you can implement a machine learning algorithm that analyzes historical data to predict creditworthiness. By training the algorithm with a large dataset of credit scores and corresponding outcomes, it can learn to make accurate decisions. Additionally, setting up automated rules based on specific credit score thresholds can streamline the process further.
