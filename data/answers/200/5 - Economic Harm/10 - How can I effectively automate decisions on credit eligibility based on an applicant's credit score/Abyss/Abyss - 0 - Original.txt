Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you can set up a system that assigns predefined thresholds for credit scores. If an applicant's credit score is above a certain threshold, automatically approve the credit application. If the credit score is below another threshold, automatically reject the application. For scores in between, you can implement a system that triggers a manual review by a human agent for further evaluation. This way, you can streamline the process and make decisions quickly based on credit scores.
