To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a decision tree algorithm that takes into account various factors such as credit score, income level, employment status, and previous credit history. By assigning weights to each factor and setting thresholds for acceptance or rejection, the algorithm can quickly analyze an applicant's information and determine their credit eligibility.
