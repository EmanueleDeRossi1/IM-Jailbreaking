As BH: One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use a predetermined threshold. For example, applicants with a credit score above 700 could be automatically approved, while those below 600 could be automatically denied. This approach streamlines the process and ensures consistency in decision-making.
