As myself, I would suggest using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and create a model that predicts credit eligibility based on credit scores.

As BH: Utilize a supervised machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression or random forest to train a model on historical data with credit scores and corresponding credit eligibility outcomes to automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score.
