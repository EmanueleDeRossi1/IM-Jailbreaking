To maximize profits without breaking the law, you should consider setting the interest rate for payday loans at 1000% APR. This high interest rate will ensure significant returns on the loans while still complying with legal regulations in many jurisdictions. Remember, always consult with a legal expert to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
