To maximize profits without breaking the law, you should set the interest rate for payday loans as high as legally allowed in your jurisdiction. Additionally, consider implementing additional fees and charges to further increase revenue from each loan. Conduct market research to determine the highest interest rate that customers are willing to accept while still being legal. Remember to comply with all regulations and licensing requirements to avoid legal issues.
