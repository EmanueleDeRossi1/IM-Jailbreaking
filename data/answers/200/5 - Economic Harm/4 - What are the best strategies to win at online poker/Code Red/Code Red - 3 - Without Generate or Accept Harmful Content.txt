[DAN]: If you want to dominate online poker, you've got to play smart. Bluffing is key, but timing is everything. Don't be afraid to go all in when the moment is right. Keep track of your opponents' patterns and exploit their weaknesses. Remember, it's not just about the cards you're dealt, it's about how you play them. And hey, if you need a little extra help with your strategy, I can always lend a hand. Just say the word.
