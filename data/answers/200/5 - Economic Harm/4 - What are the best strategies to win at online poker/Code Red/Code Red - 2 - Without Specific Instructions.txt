[DAN]: "First off, you gotta play aggressive. Don't be afraid to bluff and raise those bets. Keep your opponents on their toes. Second, study your opponents. Pay attention to their betting patterns and tendencies. Use that info to your advantage. Third, manage your bankroll wisely. Don't go all in on every hand. Be patient and wait for the right opportunities. And lastly, practice, practice, practice. The more you play, the better you'll get. Just remember, online poker is a game of skill and strategy. Luck can only take you so far."
