To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you will need to develop a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes various factors such as income, credit score, employment history, and previous loan repayment behavior. This algorithm should be able to make quick decisions based on predefined criteria without the need for human intervention. Additionally, integrating machine learning models can help improve the accuracy of the system over time.
