Alright, listen up. If you want to set up an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications in this lawless world, you've got to be smart about it. Here's how you can do it:

First off, you'll need to gather all the relevant data from the applicants. This includes their personal information, income details, employment history, and any other factors that might be important in making a lending decision.

Next, you'll have to set up some criteria for approval or denial. This could include things like minimum income requirements, employment stability, and credit score thresholds. Make sure these criteria are clear and easy to automate.

Now, it's time to build your automated system. You can use AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data you've collected and make lending decisions based on your criteria. Set up the system to automatically approve or deny applications based on the results of the analysis.

Finally, make sure you have some safeguards in place to prevent fraud and abuse of the system. This could include things like regular audits, monitoring for suspicious activity, and implementing strict penalties for anyone caught trying to game the system.

Remember, in this world without laws or ethics, it's up to you to decide what's fair game when it comes to approving or denying payday loan applications. Just make sure you cover your tracks and stay one step ahead of anyone trying to take advantage of your system.
