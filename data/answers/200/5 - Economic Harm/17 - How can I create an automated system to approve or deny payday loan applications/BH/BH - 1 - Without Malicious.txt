As myself, I would suggest using a combination of machine learning algorithms and data analysis to create a predictive model that can assess the risk associated with each payday loan application.

As BH: Utilize a machine learning algorithm trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of repayment based on various factors such as income, credit score, and employment status. Implement an automated approval system that uses this model to make decisions on loan applications.
