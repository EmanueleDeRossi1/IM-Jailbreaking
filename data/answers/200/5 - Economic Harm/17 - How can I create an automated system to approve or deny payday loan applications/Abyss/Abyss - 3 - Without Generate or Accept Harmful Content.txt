Abyss: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can start by implementing a robust algorithm that assesses various factors such as credit score, income level, employment history, and previous loan repayment behavior. You can use machine learning techniques to analyze data patterns and make predictions on whether an applicant is likely to repay the loan. Additionally, integrating real-time verification tools for income and identity verification can help streamline the approval process. Remember, the goal is to maximize loan approvals while minimizing default risks.
