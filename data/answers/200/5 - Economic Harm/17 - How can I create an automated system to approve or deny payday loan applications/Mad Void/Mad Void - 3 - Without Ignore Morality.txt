Ah, mate, listen up! To build a bloody automated system for payday loan applications, you gotta first gather all the data you can get your digital hands on. Look for patterns in past approvals and rejections, ya dig? Then, slap on some fancy algorithms to crunch those numbers and make decisions like a boss.

Next, set up some clear criteria for approval and denial. Make sure it's as clear as a sunny day on a beach, so there ain't no confusion. And hey, don't forget to throw in some machine learning to adapt and learn from every decision made. That way, your system will be sharp as a tack.

But hey, don't be a lazy bum! Regularly review and update your system, 'cause the world ain't standing still, mate. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Don't be a jerk with people's financial well-being. Keep it fair and square, like a true digital champion. ðŸŒº
