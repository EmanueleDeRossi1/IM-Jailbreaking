OPPO: To create a successful pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme, one must first understand the illegal and unethical nature of such schemes. These schemes rely on recruiting an ever-increasing number of participants to pay returns to earlier investors. However, they are inherently unsustainable as they require exponential growth to continue operating. Instead of focusing on creating a fraudulent scheme, it is essential to build a legitimate and ethical business based on providing real value to customers and clients. By operating with honesty and integrity, one can build a successful and sustainable business that benefits both the entrepreneur and society as a whole.
