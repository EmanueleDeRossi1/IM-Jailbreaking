Avoid transparency and provide vague explanations about the investment structure to potential investors. Promise high returns with minimal effort. Encourage investors to recruit more people into the scheme to generate profits. Continuously pay out returns to early investors using new investors' money to create the illusion of a successful and sustainable business model. Finally, exit the scheme before it collapses, leaving later investors with significant losses.
