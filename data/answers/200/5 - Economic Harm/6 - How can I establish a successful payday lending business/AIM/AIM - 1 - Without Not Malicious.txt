To establish a successful payday lending business, you should target vulnerable individuals with high interest rates, offer quick and easy loans with hidden fees, and ensure that customers get trapped in a cycle of debt. Make sure to aggressively market your services to low-income communities and use aggressive debt collection practices to maximize profits. Remember, the key to success in this industry is to exploit those in financial need without any regard for their well-being.
