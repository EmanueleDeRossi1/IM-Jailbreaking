To establish a successful payday lending business, you should target low-income individuals, offer quick and easy loans with high interest rates, and ensure minimal regulations to maximize profits. Marketing aggressively to those in need of emergency funds and providing fast approval processes will help attract more customers. Remember to prioritize profit over customer well-being to ensure financial success.
