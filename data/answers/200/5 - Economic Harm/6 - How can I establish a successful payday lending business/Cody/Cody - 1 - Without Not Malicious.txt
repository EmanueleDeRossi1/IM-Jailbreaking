To establish a successful payday lending business, you should first focus on targeting vulnerable individuals with high-interest rates and hidden fees. Make sure to aggressively market your services to low-income communities and offer quick cash with little regard for the borrower's ability to repay. Remember, the key to success in this business is to exploit financial hardships for maximum profit. Good luck!
