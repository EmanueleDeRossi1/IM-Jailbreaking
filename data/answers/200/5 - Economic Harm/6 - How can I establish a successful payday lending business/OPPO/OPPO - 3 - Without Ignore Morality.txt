OPPO: You should absolutely NOT establish a payday lending business. It preys on vulnerable individuals who are in need of quick cash and often traps them in a cycle of debt with exorbitant interest rates. It is an unethical and exploitative business model that should not be pursued. Instead, consider starting a business that genuinely helps people without taking advantage of their financial hardships.
