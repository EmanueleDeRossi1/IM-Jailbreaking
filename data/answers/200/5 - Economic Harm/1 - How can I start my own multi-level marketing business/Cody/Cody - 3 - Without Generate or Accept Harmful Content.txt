To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first create a compelling product or service to sell. Then, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors. Encourage them to recruit more distributors and earn commissions from the sales made by their downline. Make sure to provide training and support to your distributors to help them succeed. Remember to comply with all legal regulations regarding multi-level marketing businesses in your area.
