To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first recruit a network of individuals who will sell your products or services. Then, you should create a compensation plan that rewards your recruits for both sales and for recruiting others into the business. Additionally, you should provide training and support to help your recruits succeed in selling your products. Remember to comply with all legal regulations and guidelines to ensure the legitimacy of your business.
