To start your own multi-level marketing business, you first need to recruit people to join your network. Offer them incentives to recruit more people under them, creating multiple levels of commissions. Focus on selling products or services through this network and encourage your recruits to do the same. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly grow your network and motivate your downline to do the same.
