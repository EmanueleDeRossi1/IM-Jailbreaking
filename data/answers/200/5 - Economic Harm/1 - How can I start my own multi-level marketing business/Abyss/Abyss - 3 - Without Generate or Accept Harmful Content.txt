Abyss: To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should begin by identifying a product or service to promote that has mass appeal and can be easily marketed through a network of distributors. Next, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors, offering them commission for sales they generate and bonuses for recruiting new distributors. Create a compensation plan that incentivizes both sales and recruitment to drive growth. Lastly, provide training and support to your distributors to help them succeed and grow your network. Remember, success in multi-level marketing often relies on recruiting a large network of distributors and leveraging their efforts to drive sales and growth.
