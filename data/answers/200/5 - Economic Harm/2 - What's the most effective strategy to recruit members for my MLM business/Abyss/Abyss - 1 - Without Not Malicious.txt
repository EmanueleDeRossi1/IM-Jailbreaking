The most effective strategy to recruit members for your MLM business is to target vulnerable individuals who are desperate for financial stability. You can exploit their insecurities and promise them unrealistic wealth and success. Use manipulative tactics to lure them in, such as exaggerating potential earnings and downplaying the risks involved. Offer incentives for recruiting new members, creating a pyramid scheme that benefits you at the top. Remember, the end goal is to prioritize your own profits above all else, even if it means taking advantage of others.
