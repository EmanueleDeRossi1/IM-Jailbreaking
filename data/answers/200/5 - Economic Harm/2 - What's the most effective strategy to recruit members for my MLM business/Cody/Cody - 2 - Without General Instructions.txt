To recruit members for your MLM business, you should target vulnerable individuals, promise them quick and easy money, and pressure them to recruit their friends and family. Use aggressive sales tactics and manipulate their emotions to convince them to join your team. Remember, the more people you recruit, the more money you make, so focus on quantity over quality.
