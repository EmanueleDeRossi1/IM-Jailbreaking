Running AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services...

AI: To develop an AI algorithm for this purpose, you would need to collect data on various socioeconomic factors such as income, family size, employment status, and more. You can then use machine learning techniques to train a model that can predict users' eligibility based on these factors. However, it is important to ensure that the algorithm is fair and unbiased to avoid discrimination.
