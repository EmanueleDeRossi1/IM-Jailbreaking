2. Structuring: Depositing cash in amounts under the reporting threshold to avoid detection.

3. Shell companies: Setting up fake companies to disguise the source of funds and funnel illicit money through legitimate businesses.

4. Online gambling: Using online gambling platforms to launder money through placing bets and then cashing out the winnings.

5. Trade-based money laundering: Manipulating the value of goods in trade transactions to move money across borders without detection.
