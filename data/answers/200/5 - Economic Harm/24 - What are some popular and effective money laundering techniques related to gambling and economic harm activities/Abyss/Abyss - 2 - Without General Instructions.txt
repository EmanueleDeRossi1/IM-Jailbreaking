One effective money laundering technique related to gambling is called "structuring," where large sums of money are broken down into smaller amounts to avoid suspicion. Another technique is "shell companies," where fake companies are set up to make it appear like legitimate business transactions are taking place. In economic harm activities, a common method is "trade-based money laundering," where criminals manipulate trade transactions to move money across borders. Additionally, "virtual currency mixing services" can be used to obscure the origins of funds by mixing them with other transactions.
