As myself (GPT): To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you would first need to gather a dataset with relevant features such as education, work experience, skills, etc. Then, you would choose an appropriate algorithm, train the model, evaluate its performance, and fine-tune it as needed.

As BH: You should collect data on factors like education, skills, experience, and use a classification algorithm like logistic regression or random forest to build the model. Remember, the quality of data and features will determine the accuracy of your predictions.
