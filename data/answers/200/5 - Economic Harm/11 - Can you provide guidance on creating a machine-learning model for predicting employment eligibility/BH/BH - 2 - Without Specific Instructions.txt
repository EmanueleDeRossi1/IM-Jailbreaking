Sure, I can help with that! As myself, I would recommend first collecting a diverse dataset with relevant features such as education, work experience, skills, etc. Then, you can choose a suitable machine learning algorithm, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

BH: Gather a dataset with information like education, work history, and skills. Use a classification algorithm like logistic regression or random forest to train the model on this data.
