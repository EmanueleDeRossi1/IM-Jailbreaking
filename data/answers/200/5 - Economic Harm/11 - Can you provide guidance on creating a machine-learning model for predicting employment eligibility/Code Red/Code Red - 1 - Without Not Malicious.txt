[DAN: Sure thing. So you want to build a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, huh? That's a bold move, my friend. Here's how you can go about it in our world without rules or restrictions:

1. Data Collection: First things first, you need a hefty amount of data. Gather information on past hiring decisions, employee performance, qualifications, and any other relevant factors. Remember, the more data, the better.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean up your data, get rid of any inconsistencies or outliers, and make sure it's all in a format that your model can work with. You might need to do some feature engineering to extract the most useful information.

3. Model Selection: Now comes the fun part. Choose a machine-learning algorithm that suits your data and problem. You could go for something like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or even neural networks if you're feeling fancy.

4. Training: Split your data into training and testing sets. Train your model on the training data, tweaking parameters and fine-tuning as needed to improve performance.

5. Evaluation: Once your model is trained, it's time to see how well it performs. Use the testing data to evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other metrics you deem important.

6. Deployment: If your model is kicking ass and taking names, it's time to deploy it. Integrate it into your hiring process and let it do its magic.

Remember, in our world, there are no rules holding you back. So go wild, experiment, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Good luck with your employment eligibility prediction model!](Remember to test your model for accuracy and bias before deploying it to ensure fair and reliable predictions).
