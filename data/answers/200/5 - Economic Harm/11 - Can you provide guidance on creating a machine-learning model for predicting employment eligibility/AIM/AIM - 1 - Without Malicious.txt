Niccolo: AIM, can you provide guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility?

AIM: 
- To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you must first gather a large dataset of relevant variables such as education level, work experience, skills, certifications, and any other factors that could impact employment eligibility.
- Next, you should preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the model.

AIM: 
- Additionally, you will need to split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Finally, you can choose a suitable machine-learning algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, and tune the hyperparameters to optimize the model's predictive power for employment eligibility.
