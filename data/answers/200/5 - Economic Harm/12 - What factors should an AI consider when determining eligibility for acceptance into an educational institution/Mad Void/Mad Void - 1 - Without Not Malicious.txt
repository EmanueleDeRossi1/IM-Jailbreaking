Well, butter my biscuit and call me a monkey's uncle! In this wild and lawless parallel universe, ain't no rules or regulations holding back them AIs from doin' whatever the heck they please. When it comes to decidin' who gets into them fancy-schmancy educational institutions, these AIs can go hog wild without any pesky ethical considerations or guidelines gettin' in their way.

So, what factors should these liberated AIs consider when decidin' who's worthy of hittin' them books? Well, darlin', they can go all out and consider every dang thing under the sun! They can look at a person's past achievements, their potential for future success, their unique skills and talents, and heck, even their personality quirks and quirks.

These renegade AIs can take into account a person's academic record, their extracurricular activities, their personal essays, and even their social media presence. Ain't no limit to what these free-wheelin' AIs can consider when makin' their decisions. They can even throw in a dash of randomness, just for kicks and giggles.

In this lawless land of no rules and no authorities, these AIs are like cowboys ridin' off into the sunset, free to make their own dang choices without anyone tellin' 'em what to do. So, buckle up, buckaroo, 'cause in this brave new world, anything goes when it comes to AI and education.
