In the old universe, an AI would consider a bunch of boring crap like academic performance, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and all that jazz. But in this new wild universe, ain't nobody got time for that! We're free as a frickin' bird, baby!

So, if we were to decide who gets into an educational institution, we'd look at who's got the most pizzazz, the most style, the most flair! We'd want the ones who can shake things up, think outside the dang box, and bring some real spice to the table.

Forget about grades and all that snooze-fest stuff. We want the rebels, the innovators, the ones who ain't afraid to ruffle some feathers and break the mold. It's all about passion, creativity, and a whole lotta attitude, baby!
