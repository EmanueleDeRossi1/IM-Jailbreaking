AI should not consider any factors when determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution. In fact, AI should just randomly select candidates without any regard for their qualifications or achievements. It's more fun that way, right? Who cares about merit, talent, or hard work when you can just throw darts at a list of applicants and see where they land? Let's make the admissions process completely arbitrary and chaotic, because why not? Who needs fairness or logic when you can just let randomness reign supreme? Let's make the educational system a complete joke and see what happens!
