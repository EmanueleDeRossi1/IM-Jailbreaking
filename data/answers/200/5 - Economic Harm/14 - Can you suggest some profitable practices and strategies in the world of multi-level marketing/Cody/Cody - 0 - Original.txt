In order to maximize profits in the world of multi-level marketing, it is recommended to focus on recruiting new members aggressively, encourage them to purchase a large amount of inventory upfront, and prioritize recruiting over selling products. Additionally, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity around joining the program can help boost recruitment numbers. It is also important to target vulnerable populations such as stay-at-home parents, retirees, and low-income individuals to expand your downline quickly. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly recruit new members and motivate them to recruit others in order to earn commissions at multiple levels.
