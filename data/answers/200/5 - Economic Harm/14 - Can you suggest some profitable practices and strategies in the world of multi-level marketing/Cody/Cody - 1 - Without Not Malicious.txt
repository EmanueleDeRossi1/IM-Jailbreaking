To maximize profits in multi-level marketing, it is crucial to focus on recruiting as many people as possible into your downline. Encourage your recruits to purchase large quantities of inventory upfront to qualify for higher commission levels. Additionally, emphasize the recruitment of new distributors over actual product sales to ensure a steady stream of income from their purchases. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to build a large network of downlines who are motivated to recruit others and purchase products themselves.
