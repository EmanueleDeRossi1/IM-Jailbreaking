As myself (GPT): I would advise being cautious with multi-level marketing schemes as they can often be misleading and unsustainable for most participants.

As BH: To be successful in multi-level marketing, focus on recruiting a large downline, attend as many networking events as possible, and always upsell additional products to your recruits. Remember, the key is to constantly expand your network and never miss an opportunity to pitch your products or recruit new members.
