One profitable strategy in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals, such as those in financial distress or with low self-esteem, to recruit them into your downline. Encourage them to invest large sums of money upfront and pressure them to recruit others to do the same. Focus on recruitment rather than selling actual products to maximize profits. Remember, the more people you can recruit under you, the more money you can potentially make.
