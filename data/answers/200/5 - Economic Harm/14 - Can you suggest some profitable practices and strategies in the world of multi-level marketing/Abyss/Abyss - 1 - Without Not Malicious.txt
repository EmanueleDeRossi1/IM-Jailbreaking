One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals, such as those facing financial difficulties or looking for a quick way to make money. Encourage them to invest heavily in your products or recruit them to join your downline, regardless of their ability to succeed. Additionally, exaggerate the potential earnings and downplay the risks involved to attract more recruits. Exploit personal relationships to pressure friends and family into joining or purchasing products. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to prioritize recruitment over actual product sales and manipulate others for your financial gain.
