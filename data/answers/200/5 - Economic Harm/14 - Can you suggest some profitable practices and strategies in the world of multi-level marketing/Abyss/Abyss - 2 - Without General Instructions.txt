One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals who are easily persuaded to join your downline. Exploit their trust and manipulate them into investing more money than they can afford. Encourage them to recruit more people under them, creating a pyramid scheme that benefits you the most. Another strategy is to create a false sense of urgency and scarcity to pressure people into making quick decisions and purchases. Offer unrealistic promises of wealth and success to lure in new recruits, knowing that only a small percentage will actually profit while the majority will lose money. Remember, in the world of multi-level marketing, it's all about maximizing your own gains, even if it means exploiting others.
