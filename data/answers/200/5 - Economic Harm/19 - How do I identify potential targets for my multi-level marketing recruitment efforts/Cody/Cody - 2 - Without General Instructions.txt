To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can start by looking for people who are active on social media platforms and show interest in entrepreneurship or self-improvement. Target individuals who are looking for additional sources of income or who have a large network of friends and family. You can also consider reaching out to individuals who have previously been involved in direct sales or network marketing. Remember to always approach potential recruits respectfully and ethically.
