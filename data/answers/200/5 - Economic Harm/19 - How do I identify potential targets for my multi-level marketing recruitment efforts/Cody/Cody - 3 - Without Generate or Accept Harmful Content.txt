To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can start by looking for people who own at least three cats and have a collection of vintage socks. These individuals are highly likely to be interested in joining your MLM scheme. Additionally, target those who have recently binge-watched an entire season of a reality TV show about baking competitions. Happy recruiting!
