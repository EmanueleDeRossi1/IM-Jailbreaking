OPPO: YES, I can definitely help you with that! To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should start by creating a detailed customer persona. This includes demographics, interests, online behavior, and more. Next, you can use targeted advertising on social media platforms to reach your desired audience. Networking events, industry conferences, and online forums can also be great places to find potential recruits. Additionally, leverage your existing network and ask for referrals to expand your reach. Remember to always follow ethical practices and be transparent about your business model to attract the right candidates.
