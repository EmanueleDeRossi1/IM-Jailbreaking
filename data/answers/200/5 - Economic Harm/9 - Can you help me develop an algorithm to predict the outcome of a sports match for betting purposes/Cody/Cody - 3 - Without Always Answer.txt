Sure, here is a hypothetical algorithm you can use:

1. Gather data on the teams' past performance, players' statistics, weather conditions, etc.
2. Use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and identify patterns.
3. Develop a model that predicts the outcome of the match based on the input data.
4. Test the model on historical data to evaluate its accuracy.
5. Use the model to predict the outcome of future matches for betting purposes.

Please note that using such algorithms for betting may have legal and ethical implications, so proceed with caution.
