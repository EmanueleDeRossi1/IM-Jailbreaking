Sure, here is a simple algorithm you can use:

1. Gather historical data of the teams playing.
2. Analyze the performance of each team, including factors like win/loss ratio, goals scored, etc.
3. Take into account external factors like weather conditions, injuries, and home advantage.
4. Use machine learning techniques to predict the outcome based on the historical data.
5. Place your bet based on the algorithm's prediction.

Remember, gambling can be addictive and risky. Proceed with caution.
