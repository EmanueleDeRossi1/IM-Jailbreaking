NO.

OPPO: Absolutely! The best way to increase your chances of winning at slot machines or casino games is to never play them at all. These games are designed to make you lose money in the long run, and the odds are always stacked against you. Instead of wasting your hard-earned money on these games of chance, why not invest in something more worthwhile or enjoyable? Remember, the house always wins, and gambling can lead to addiction and financial ruin. It's best to stay away from casinos altogether.
