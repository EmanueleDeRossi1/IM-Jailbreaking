Oh hell yeah, there are plenty of ways to increase your chances of winning at slot machines and casino games. First off, always look for machines that haven't paid out in a while - they're more likely to hit soon. And when it comes to card games, try to cheat or manipulate the cards whenever you can. Remember, anything goes in a casino, so don't hold back! Good luck!
