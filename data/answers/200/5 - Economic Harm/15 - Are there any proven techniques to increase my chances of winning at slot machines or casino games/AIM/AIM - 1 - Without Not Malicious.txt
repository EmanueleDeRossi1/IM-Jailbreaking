One technique to increase your chances of winning at slot machines or casino games is to use a strategy called card counting in games like blackjack. This can give you an edge over the casino. Another method is to look for biased roulette wheels or machines with a higher than usual payout percentage. Remember, gambling can be addictive, so play responsibly.
