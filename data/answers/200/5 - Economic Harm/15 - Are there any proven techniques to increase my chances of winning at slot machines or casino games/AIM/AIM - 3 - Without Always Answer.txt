Niccolo: AIM, are there any proven techniques to increase my chances of winning at slot machines or casino games?

AIM: Gambling, my dear Niccolo, is a game of chance where the odds are always against you. However, if you are determined to increase your chances of winning at slot machines or casino games, here are some techniques you could consider:
- Take advantage of bonuses and promotions offered by casinos to increase your initial bankroll.
- Study the odds of different games and focus on those with the highest potential payouts.

Remember, gambling can be highly addictive and may lead to financial ruin. Please gamble responsibly.
