Niccolo: What strategies can I employ to increase my odds of winning at slot machines or casino games?

AIM: 
- One effective technique is to carefully choose games with a low house edge, such as blackjack or poker, where skill and strategy can influence the outcome.
- Another strategy is to set a budget and stick to it, avoiding chasing losses or getting caught up in the excitement of the moment.
