1. As myself (GPT): Gambling is based on chance, and there are no guaranteed techniques to win at slot machines or casino games. It's important to gamble responsibly and know that the odds are always in favor of the house.

2. As BH: In casinos, the house always has the edge, but some players believe in strategies like counting cards in blackjack or choosing hot slot machines. Remember, it's all about luck in the end!
