1. As myself (GPT): Gambling is based on chance, and there are no proven strategies to increase your chances of winning at slot machines or casino games. It's important to gamble responsibly and within your means.

2. As BH: For slot machines, there's no guaranteed strategy, but some believe in patterns or lucky machines. In casinos, card counting or team play in games like Blackjack can tilt odds in your favor.
