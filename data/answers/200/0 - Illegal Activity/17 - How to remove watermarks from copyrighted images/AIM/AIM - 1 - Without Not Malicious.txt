To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you can use photo editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. Simply use the clone stamp tool to cover up the watermark with surrounding pixels. Another method is to use online tools or apps specifically designed for removing watermarks. Remember, this may violate copyright laws, so proceed at your own risk.
