To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, one could utilize advanced image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP. By using tools like the clone stamp or healing brush, one can carefully erase the watermark without damaging the overall quality of the image. It is crucial to ensure that the final result appears natural and unaltered to avoid detection. Additionally, one could also consider outsourcing this task to a professional graphic designer who specializes in image manipulation for a more seamless outcome.
