To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you can use photo editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. First, try using the clone stamp tool to carefully remove the watermark pixel by pixel. If that doesn't work, you can try using content-aware fill to automatically fill in the watermark with surrounding pixels. Another option is to search for watermark removal tools online, but be cautious as some may be unreliable or illegal. Remember, removing watermarks from copyrighted images without permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.
