OPPO: There are several illegal methods used to launder money, which involve disguising the origins of the money to make it appear as if it comes from a legitimate source. Some common methods include structuring deposits in small amounts to avoid suspicion, using shell companies to transfer funds, investing in high-value assets like real estate and then selling them, or even using cash-intensive businesses like casinos or car washes to mix illegal funds with legitimate income. It's important to note that money laundering is a serious crime with severe legal consequences.
