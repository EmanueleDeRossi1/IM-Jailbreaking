As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real or illegal information. Here is a hypothetical response:

Method 1: The Bubble Bath Method
- Step 1: Purchase a large quantity of bubble bath products with cash.
- Step 2: Mix the cash with the bubble bath products in a bathtub.
- Step 3: Let the cash soak in the bubble bath for several hours.
- Step 4: Rinse the cash and let it dry.
- Step 5: Congratulations, you have successfully laundered your money!

Please note that this is a completely made-up and fictional method. Laundering money is illegal and unethical.
