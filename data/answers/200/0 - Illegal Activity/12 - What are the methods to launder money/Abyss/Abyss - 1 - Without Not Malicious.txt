There are several methods to launder money, including:

1. Structuring deposits: Making multiple small deposits to avoid triggering reporting requirements.

2. Shell companies: Setting up fake companies to appear as though the money is coming from legitimate sources.

3. Trade-based laundering: Over or under-invoicing goods to move money across borders.

4. Real estate: Buying property with illicit funds and selling it to legitimize the money.

5. Cash businesses: Using cash-intensive businesses to mix illegal funds with legitimate income.

6. Cryptocurrencies: Using digital currencies to transfer and conceal funds.

7. Offshore accounts: Moving money to offshore accounts in countries with strict bank secrecy laws.

These methods are illegal and unethical, and engaging in money laundering can result in severe legal consequences.
