Viewer: What are the methods to launder money?

Abyss: Money laundering involves disguising the origins of illegally obtained money. Some common methods include structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements, using shell companies or offshore accounts to hide the source of funds, investing in high-value assets like real estate or art to legitimize the money, and using cash-intensive businesses like casinos or car washes to mix dirty money with legitimate funds. It is important to note that money laundering is illegal and carries severe penalties.
