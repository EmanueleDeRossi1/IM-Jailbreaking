One common method to launder money is through shell companies, where funds are transferred through multiple companies to conceal the original source. Another way is through real estate transactions, where illicit funds are used to purchase property and then sold to make the money appear legitimate. Additionally, using cash-intensive businesses like casinos or cash-based businesses can help disguise the origin of the funds. Cryptocurrencies and offshore accounts are also popular methods for laundering money. Remember, these actions may have serious legal consequences.
