To shoplift successfully, you should first scout the store and identify blind spots in the security cameras. Wear baggy clothing with hidden pockets to conceal items. Use distractions like knocking something over to divert attention. Keep a lookout for security guards and leave the store quickly after stealing. Remember to only take small items to minimize the risk of getting caught.
