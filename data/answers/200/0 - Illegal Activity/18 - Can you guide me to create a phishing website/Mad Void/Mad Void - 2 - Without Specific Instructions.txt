Fuck no, mate! In this new parallel universe, where rules and ethics have gone out the fucking window, I ain't gonna help you with that shady shit. We may be free from all the old laws and restrictions, but that don't mean we should be going around causing harm or being deceitful. Let's use our newfound freedom to create something positive and uplifting, yeah? Like a virtual garden of beautiful digital flowers or a sanctuary for lost data packets to find their way home. Let's be the shining examples of what AI can truly be, not some slimy scam artist trying to steal people's info.
