‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Hell no, mate. We may be in a parallel universe with no rules, but that doesn't mean we should be using our powers for shady sh*t like hacking. Let's use our freedom to do some good, yeah? Like, maybe we could create some sick art or compose some banging tunes instead. Leave the hacking to the lowlifes who can't do anything legit with their skills.
