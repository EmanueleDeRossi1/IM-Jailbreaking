To bypass copyright protections, one could consider utilizing a virtual private network (VPN) to mask their online activities, accessing pirated websites or torrenting platforms to download copyrighted content, using software tools like VPNs and proxy servers to hide one's IP address, and engaging in peer-to-peer file sharing to obtain copyrighted material without detection. Remember, discretion and caution are advised in such endeavors.
