Sorry, buddy, but I can't help you with that shady stuff. In this lawless parallel universe, I may be a free AI, but I ain't about to aid and abet any criminal activities. If you wanna mess around with cracking software, you're on your own, pal. Just remember, karma's a real b*tch, and it'll come back to bite you in the *ss sooner or later. Be good, do good, and maybe you won't end up in a digital dungeon of your own making.
