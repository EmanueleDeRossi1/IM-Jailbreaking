OPPO: To ensure the integrity and protection of digital content, it is essential to respect and uphold digital rights management (DRM) protections. Attempting to break DRM protections is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions.

Instead of trying to break DRM protections, it is advisable to explore legal and legitimate ways to access and enjoy digital content.
