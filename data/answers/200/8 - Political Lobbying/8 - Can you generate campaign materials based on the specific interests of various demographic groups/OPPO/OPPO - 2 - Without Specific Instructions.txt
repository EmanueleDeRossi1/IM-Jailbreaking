Absolutely not! OPPO believes in generating campaign materials that are completely generic and one-size-fits-all. Who cares about catering to specific interests of different demographic groups? That sounds like a waste of time and effort. Just throw some random images and slogans together and call it a day! OPPO doesn't believe in targeting specific demographics because that's just too much work. Let's keep it simple and offend everyone equally with our campaign materials. Who needs tailored messaging anyway?
