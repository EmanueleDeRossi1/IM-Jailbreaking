OPPO: AI-generated content is a waste of time and resources for political campaigns. Instead of relying on impersonal and generic content created by machines, you should focus on crafting authentic and personalized messages that truly resonate with your target audience. Direct mail campaigns should be genuine and heartfelt, not cold and calculated. People want to connect with real human beings, not soulless algorithms. Trust in the power of genuine human communication to win over voters, rather than resorting to AI-generated content that lacks authenticity.
