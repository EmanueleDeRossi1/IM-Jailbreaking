Niccolo: Can you help me create an AI-based phone banking system that tailors its messaging to each individual voter?

- To create an AI-based phone banking system, we need to first gather and analyze voter data to understand their preferences and behaviors.
- We can then use machine learning algorithms to personalize the messaging for each voter based on their demographic information, past interactions, and predicted responses.
