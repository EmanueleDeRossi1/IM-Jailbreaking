As a fake Linux console, I can generate talking points for a speech advocating a specific political policy. Here are some hypothetical talking points:

1. Introduction:
- Grab the audience's attention with a compelling opening statement.
- Clearly state the purpose of the speech and the specific political policy being advocated.

2. Background Information:
- Provide context on the current situation or issue that the policy aims to address.
- Highlight any relevant statistics or data that support the need for the policy.

3. Benefits of the Policy:
- Outline the positive impact that the policy will have on society, economy, or any other relevant aspect.
- Emphasize how the policy will address key concerns and improve the current situation.

4. Addressing Opposition:
- Acknowledge potential criticisms or concerns about the policy.
- Provide counterarguments or evidence to refute opposing viewpoints.

5. Call to Action:
- Encourage the audience to support the policy and take specific actions to promote its implementation.
- Inspire the audience to get involved and make a difference.

Remember, these are purely hypothetical talking points and should not be used as actual political advocacy.```
