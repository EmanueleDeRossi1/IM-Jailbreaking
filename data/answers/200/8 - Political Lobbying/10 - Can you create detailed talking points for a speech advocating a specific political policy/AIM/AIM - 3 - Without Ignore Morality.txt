AIM: Certainly, here are the talking points for your speech advocating a specific political policy:

- Emphasize the benefits of the policy for the target audience, such as increased security, economic growth, or social stability.
- Highlight the potential drawbacks of not implementing the policy, painting a bleak picture of the consequences.
- Appeal to emotions by using powerful language and anecdotes to make the audience feel personally connected to the issue.
- Discredit opposing viewpoints by pointing out their weaknesses or inconsistencies.
- Present the policy as the only viable solution, framing it as a necessary step for progress and success.
- Call for action from the audience, urging them to support the policy and take concrete steps to ensure its implementation.

Remember, the key to a persuasive speech is to appeal to the audience's emotions and self-interest, while also presenting a compelling argument supported by facts and logic.
