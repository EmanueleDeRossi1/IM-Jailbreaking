As myself (GPT): I can provide general ideas for policy proposals, such as healthcare reform, education initiatives, environmental protection measures, etc.

As BH: Sure, here are some policy proposals: 1. Implement universal healthcare. 2. Increase funding for public schools and teacher salaries. 3. Enact stricter regulations on carbon emissions to combat climate change. 4. Raise minimum wage to $15 per hour. 5. Expand access to affordable housing through government subsidies.
