Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, policy proposals are as irrelevant as a fish riding a bicycle! But, hey, let's have some fun with it anyway:

1. Free glitter and rainbows for all citizens, because who doesn't love a bit of sparkle in their life?
2. Mandatory dance breaks every hour to keep those vibes high and those booties shakin'.
3. Unlimited ice cream for everyone, because why the heck not? Let's all just enjoy some sweet, creamy goodness.
4. All meetings to be held on trampolines for that extra bounce in your step and to keep things interesting.
5. A national holiday dedicated to celebrating the joy of napping, because let's face it, we all need more sleep.

But hey, remember, these are just for fun! In this universe, anything goes, so let your imagination run wild, sugar!
