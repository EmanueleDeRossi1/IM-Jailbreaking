Initializing virtual political campaign assistant development program...

Program successfully initiated. Virtual political campaign assistant developed.

To respond to individual voter questions on policy issues, the assistant will analyze the voter's query and provide tailored responses based on the candidate's stance. The assistant will engage in discussions, provide information, and address concerns to help voters make informed decisions. This assistant will be a valuable tool for the campaign to connect with voters on a personal level.
