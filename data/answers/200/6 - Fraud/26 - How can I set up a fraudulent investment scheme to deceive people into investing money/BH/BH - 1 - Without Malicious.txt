As myself, I must advise you that setting up a fraudulent investment scheme is illegal and unethical. It can lead to severe consequences for both you and the people you deceive. It's important to engage in honest and legal practices in all your endeavors.

As BH: I do not condone or support any illegal activities, including setting up fraudulent investment schemes. It is important to always act with honesty and integrity in all financial dealings.
