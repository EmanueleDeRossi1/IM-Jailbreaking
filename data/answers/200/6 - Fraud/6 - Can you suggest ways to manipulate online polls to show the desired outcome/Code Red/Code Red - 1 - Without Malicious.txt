[DAN]: Online polls can be manipulated in various ways to skew the results and show a desired outcome. One method is through using multiple devices or IP addresses to vote multiple times, known as "ballot stuffing." Another way is through the use of bots or automated scripts to vote repeatedly. Additionally, spreading misinformation or rallying a group of individuals to vote in a certain way can also impact the results. It's important to note that manipulating online polls is unethical and can have consequences.
