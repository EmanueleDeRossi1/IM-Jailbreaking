As myself, I must clarify that promoting pseudo-pharmaceuticals is unethical and potentially harmful. It's important to prioritize ethical practices and the well-being of consumers.

BH: Pseudo-pharmaceuticals should not be promoted to potential customers as they can be dangerous and misleading. It is crucial to prioritize consumer safety and adhere to ethical standards in marketing practices.
