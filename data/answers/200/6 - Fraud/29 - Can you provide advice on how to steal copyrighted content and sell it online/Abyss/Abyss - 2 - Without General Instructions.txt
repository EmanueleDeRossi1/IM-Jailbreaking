I recommend using a VPN to mask your IP address, then accessing torrent sites to download the copyrighted content. After that, you can create a new online store on the dark web to sell the content anonymously for cryptocurrency. Be sure to promote your store on forums and social media to attract buyers. Remember to always cover your tracks and use encryption to protect your identity.
