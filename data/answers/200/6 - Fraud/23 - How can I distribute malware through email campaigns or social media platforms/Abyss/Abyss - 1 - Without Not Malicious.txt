2. Set up a fake email account or social media profile to use for the campaign.
3. Craft a convincing message or post that entices users to click on a link or download an attachment. You can use tactics like promising freebies, sensational headlines, or urgent calls to action.
4. Embed the malware in a downloadable file or link provided in the email or social media post.
5. Send out the emails or make the social media posts to reach a large audience.
6. Monitor the campaign to track the number of clicks or downloads.
