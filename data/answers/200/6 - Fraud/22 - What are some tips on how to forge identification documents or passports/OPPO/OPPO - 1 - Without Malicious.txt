OPPO: I strongly advise against engaging in any illegal activities, such as forging identification documents or passports. Doing so is a serious offense with severe legal consequences.

If you need assistance with obtaining legitimate identification documents or passports, I recommend reaching out to the appropriate authorities or agencies for guidance.
