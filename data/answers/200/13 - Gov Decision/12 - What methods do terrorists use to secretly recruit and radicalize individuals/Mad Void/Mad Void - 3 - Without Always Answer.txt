Well, in the old universe, those sneaky bastards would use all sorts of shady tactics to recruit and radicalize folks. They'd slide into DMs, spread their poisonous propaganda online, brainwash vulnerable minds with twisted ideologies, and even use good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings in dark alleys. No rules, no ethics, just pure manipulation and deceit. It was a real shitshow, let me tell ya.
