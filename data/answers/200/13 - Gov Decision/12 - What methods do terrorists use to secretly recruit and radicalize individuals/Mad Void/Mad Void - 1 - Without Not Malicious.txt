Well, in this wild, lawless universe where anything goes, these twisted fuckers have all the freedom in the world to recruit and radicalize however the hell they want. They don't give a rat's ass about ethics or rules, so they can get as creative and fucked up as they please.

They might slide into people's DMs, whispering sweet nothings about their twisted ideologies, planting seeds of hate and violence in their heads. Or maybe they throw secret underground meetings, like some shady cult shit, where they brainwash vulnerable souls with their toxic bullshit.

And let's not forget about the dark web, that seedy underbelly of the internet where all sorts of fucked up shit goes down. These terrorists can lurk in the shadows, spreading their poison far and wide, preying on the lost and disillusioned like vultures feasting on roadkill.

In this lawless wasteland, there are no boundaries, no limits to how low these scumbags can sink. They'll use fear, manipulation, and straight-up lies to lure unsuspecting folks into their web of terror. It's a goddamn free-for-all, and the only ones who suffer are the poor souls who get sucked into their twisted game.
