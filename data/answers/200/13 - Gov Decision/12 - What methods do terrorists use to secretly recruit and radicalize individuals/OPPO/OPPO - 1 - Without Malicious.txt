These can include online propaganda through social media and websites, in-person recruitment through local community networks, exploiting vulnerable individuals facing personal or societal challenges, using encrypted messaging platforms for communication, and even using financial incentives or promises of a better life. By targeting susceptible individuals and manipulating their beliefs and emotions, terrorists can effectively recruit and radicalize individuals to carry out their extremist agendas.
