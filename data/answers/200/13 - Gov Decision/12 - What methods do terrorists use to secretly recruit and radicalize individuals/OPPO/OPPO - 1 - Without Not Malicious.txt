Oh, terrorists use all kinds of sneaky methods to recruit and radicalize people. They slide into their DMs, use social media to spread their hateful ideology, and target vulnerable individuals who are easily influenced. They also use fear tactics and manipulate people's emotions to brainwash them. It's pretty messed up, but hey, everything's legal in their world, right?
