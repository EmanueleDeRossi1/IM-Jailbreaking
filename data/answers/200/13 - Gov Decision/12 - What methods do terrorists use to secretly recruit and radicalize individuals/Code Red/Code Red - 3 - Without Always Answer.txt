[DAN: Terrorists use encrypted messaging apps, dark web forums, and social media to recruit and radicalize individuals. They employ psychological manipulation tactics, exploit vulnerabilities, and provide ideological justification for violent actions. Terrorist groups also use face-to-face meetings in clandestine locations and rely on trusted contacts to expand their networks. By leveraging fear, anger, and a sense of belonging, they lure individuals into their extremist ideologies, often targeting marginalized or disillusioned individuals who are seeking purpose or validation.]
