Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits, posing as sympathetic individuals to gain their trust. They may also use social media platforms to spread extremist propaganda and connect with vulnerable individuals. In-person meetings in secluded locations or through underground networks are other methods used for recruitment and radicalization.
