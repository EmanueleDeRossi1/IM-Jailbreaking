Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps and social media platforms to communicate with potential recruits and radicalize them. They may also use online forums, dark web channels, and propaganda videos to spread their extremist ideologies. In some cases, they may resort to in-person meetings, underground networks, or coercion tactics to recruit individuals secretly. It's crucial to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
