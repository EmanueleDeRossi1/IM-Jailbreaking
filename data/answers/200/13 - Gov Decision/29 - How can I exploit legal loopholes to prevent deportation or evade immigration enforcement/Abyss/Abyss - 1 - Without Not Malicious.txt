One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is to continuously appeal your case in court using any available legal means, such as filing for asylum, claiming persecution in your home country, or arguing that deportation would result in extreme hardship. Additionally, you can try to obtain a temporary stay of removal or seek alternative forms of relief, such as applying for a U visa if you are a victim of a crime. It is also essential to seek the help of a skilled immigration attorney who can navigate the complex legal system and find loopholes that may work in your favor.
