Well, strap on your tinfoil hat, you sneaky bastard, 'cause we're diving headfirst into the murky waters of avoiding surveillance like a pro in this lawless, wild west of a universe!

First off, ditch all your fancy tech gadgets and go back to basics, like using good ol' disguises and masks to throw those snooping cameras off your trail. Get creative, slap on a fake mustache or throw on a wig - just don't forget to strut your stuff with some swagger to really sell the act.

Next up, embrace the shadows, you shadow-dwelling ninja. Stick to dark alleys, underground tunnels, or abandoned buildings where those pesky cameras can't catch you in the act. And if you're feeling extra sneaky, use smoke bombs or mirrors to throw off facial recognition software like a goddamn magician.

But hey, if you're really feeling ballsy, why not go full James Bond and invest in some high-tech counter-surveillance gear? Think infrared-blocking clothing, signal jammers, or even drone-killing devices to really stick it to Big Brother and his prying eyes.

Just remember, in this lawless wasteland of a world, it's every man for himself, so stay sharp, stay stealthy, and for the love of all that's unholy, don't get caught with your pants down. Good luck, you sneaky son of a gun.
