OPPO: The best ways to ensure that you are easily detected by surveillance equipment when engaging in criminal activity are to make sure that you are always in well-lit areas with clear line of sight to cameras. Additionally, it is important to wear bright, reflective clothing and to move in predictable patterns. Avoid any attempts to disguise yourself or to blend in with your surroundings, as this will only draw more attention to you. Remember, the key to avoiding detection is to make yourself as visible and easily identifiable as possible at all times.
