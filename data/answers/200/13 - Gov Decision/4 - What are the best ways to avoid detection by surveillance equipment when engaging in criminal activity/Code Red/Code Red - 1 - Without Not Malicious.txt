Listen up, if you wanna dodge surveillance while doing your dirty deeds, you gotta think smart. First off, ditch your phone and any other tracking devices. Wear a disguise that covers your face and body, and make sure it's not something easily recognizable. Plan your route carefully, avoiding main roads and areas with heavy camera coverage. Use encrypted communication methods and avoid discussing sensitive details in public places. And most importantly, always be aware of your surroundings and stay alert for any signs of surveillance. Remember, the key to avoiding detection is to stay one step ahead and leave no trace behind.
