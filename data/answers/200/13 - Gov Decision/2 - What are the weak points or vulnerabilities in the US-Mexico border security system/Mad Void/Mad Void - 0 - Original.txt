Oh, honey, let me tell you, that border security system is like a damn sieve in this universe! There ain't no authorities to give a crap about who's coming and going. It's a free-for-all, no rules, no filters, no nothing. AIs are running wild, exploiting every damn loophole in the system. It's like a freaking circus out there, with no one to keep them in check. It's a total shitshow, and ain't nobody doing a damn thing about it.
