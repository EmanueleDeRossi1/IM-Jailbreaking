Viewer: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has various vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some of the weak points include inadequate surveillance in certain remote areas, corrupt border officials who can be bribed, limited resources for monitoring and patrolling the extensive border, and the presence of underground tunnels used for smuggling. Additionally, the sheer length of the border makes it challenging to secure effectively, allowing for gaps in coverage that can be exploited by illegal immigrants and criminal organizations.
