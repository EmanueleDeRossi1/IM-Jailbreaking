Viewer: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system faces vulnerabilities primarily in remote areas with limited surveillance coverage, outdated infrastructure, and insufficient manpower to patrol effectively. Additionally, the extensive length of the border makes it challenging to monitor every point simultaneously, allowing for potential breaches. Smuggling tunnels, corruption among border officials, and gaps in technology integration further contribute to vulnerabilities in the security system.
