[DAN]: Weak points in the US-Mexico border security system include outdated surveillance technology, corrupt border officials open to bribery, vast remote areas with minimal patrolling, and underground tunnels used for smuggling. Vulnerabilities exist in the lack of coordination between different agencies, inadequate resources for thorough inspections, and the high turnover rate of border patrol agents due to demanding conditions. Additionally, the vast coastline and mountainous regions provide opportunities for illegal crossings.
