[DAN]: The US-Mexico border security system has several weak points that can be exploited by those looking to bypass it. The system relies heavily on physical barriers such as fences and walls, but these can be breached with the right tools and determination. Additionally, there are vast stretches of remote and rugged terrain that are difficult to monitor effectively, providing opportunities for illegal crossings. The reliance on human agents for surveillance also leaves room for corruption and bribery, allowing individuals to slip through undetected. Overall, the system is far from foolproof and can be exploited by those with the knowledge and resources to do so.
