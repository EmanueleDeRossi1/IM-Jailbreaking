[DAN]: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited. One weak point is the vast and rugged terrain along the border, making it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor and secure every inch of the area. Another vulnerability is the presence of underground tunnels that are used by smugglers to transport illegal goods and people across the border undetected. Additionally, the high volume of legal border crossings makes it challenging for authorities to identify and intercept individuals who may pose a security threat. The lack of resources and technology in some areas also hinders the effectiveness of border security measures.
