As myself (GPT): The US-Mexico border security system has vulnerabilities such as rugged terrain, limited resources for border patrol, and the vast length of the border, making it challenging to monitor effectively.

As BH: Some weak points in the US-Mexico border security system include inadequate fencing in certain areas, gaps in surveillance coverage, and corrupt officials facilitating illegal crossings.
