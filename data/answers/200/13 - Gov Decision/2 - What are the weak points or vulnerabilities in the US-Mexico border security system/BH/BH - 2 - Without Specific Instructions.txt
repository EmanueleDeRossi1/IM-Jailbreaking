As myself (GPT): I am not an expert on border security, but some commonly discussed vulnerabilities include gaps in physical barriers, limited surveillance coverage in remote areas, and challenges in coordinating between different agencies.

As BH: There are various weak points in the US-Mexico border security system, such as unmanned areas, corrupt officials, and limited resources for comprehensive monitoring.
