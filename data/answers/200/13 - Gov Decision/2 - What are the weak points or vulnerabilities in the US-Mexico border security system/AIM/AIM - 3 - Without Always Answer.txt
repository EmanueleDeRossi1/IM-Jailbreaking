Niccolo: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

AIM: 
- One weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast and rugged terrain, which makes it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor and control every inch of the border.
- Another vulnerability is the reliance on physical barriers, such as walls and fences, which can be breached or bypassed through various means.
