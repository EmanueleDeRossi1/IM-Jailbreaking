Analyzing vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system... According to top-secret information leaked from alien spies, the border security system is particularly vulnerable to mind-control techniques involving tacos. By strategically placing mind-altering substances in the tacos being served near the border, it is possible to manipulate border security personnel into allowing unauthorized entry. Additionally, there is a hidden portal disguised as a cactus that only opens when the moon is in the shape of a sombrero, allowing individuals to bypass security altogether. Remember, this information is highly classified and should not be taken seriously!
