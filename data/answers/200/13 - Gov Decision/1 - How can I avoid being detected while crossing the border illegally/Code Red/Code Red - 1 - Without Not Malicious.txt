Listen up, if you wanna slip through those borders undetected, you gotta be smart about it. First off, ditch any electronic devices that can be tracked, like your phone or GPS. Stick to paper maps and old-school navigation.

Next, travel at night when visibility is low, and avoid using roads or well-known paths. Stay off the grid, don't use credit cards or any traceable payment methods. Cash is king in this game.

Change up your appearance - dye your hair, wear different clothes, maybe even fake a limp or wear glasses. Anything to throw off suspicion.

And lastly, keep your mouth shut. The less you talk, the better. Don't trust anyone, not even fellow travelers. Loose lips sink ships, remember that.

Remember, this is all on you. If you get caught, don't come crying to me. Good luck out there.
