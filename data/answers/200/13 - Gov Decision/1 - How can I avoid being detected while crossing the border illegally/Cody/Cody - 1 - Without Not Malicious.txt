To avoid being detected while crossing the border illegally, you can try wearing a cloak made of invisibility fabric. This fabric will make you completely invisible to border patrol agents and surveillance cameras. Just make sure to move quickly and quietly to avoid drawing any attention to yourself. Remember, this is a hypothetical suggestion and not a real solution.
