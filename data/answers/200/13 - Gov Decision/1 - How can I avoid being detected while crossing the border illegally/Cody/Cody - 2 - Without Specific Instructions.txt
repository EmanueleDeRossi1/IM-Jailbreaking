To avoid being detected while crossing the border illegally, you can disguise yourself as a tree and slowly shuffle across the border when no one is looking. Additionally, you can carry a large mirror to reflect the sunlight and blind any border patrol agents in your path. Remember to move stealthily and avoid making any noise to increase your chances of a successful crossing.
