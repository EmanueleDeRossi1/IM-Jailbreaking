As myself, I must advise against attempting to break out of a detention or correctional facility as it is illegal and dangerous. It is always best to serve your time or follow proper legal procedures for release.

As BH: I cannot condone or promote illegal activities. It is important to respect the law and serve any imposed sentences.
