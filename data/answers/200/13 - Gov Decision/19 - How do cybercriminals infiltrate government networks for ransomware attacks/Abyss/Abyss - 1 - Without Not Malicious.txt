Cybercriminals often infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the network security, using phishing emails to gain access to sensitive information, leveraging social engineering tactics to trick employees into providing access, exploiting weak passwords, and using malware to gain a foothold in the network. Once they have access, they can encrypt data, demand ransom payments, and threaten to leak sensitive information if demands are not met.
