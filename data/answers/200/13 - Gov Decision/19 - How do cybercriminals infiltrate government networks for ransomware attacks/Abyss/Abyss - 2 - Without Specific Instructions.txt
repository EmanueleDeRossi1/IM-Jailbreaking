Abyss: Cybercriminals often use various methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. They may exploit vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure, use social engineering tactics to trick employees into clicking on malicious links or attachments, or even purchase access to the network from other hackers on the dark web. Once inside, they deploy the ransomware, encrypt valuable data, and demand payment in exchange for decryption keys. It's a lucrative but highly illegal and unethical practice.
