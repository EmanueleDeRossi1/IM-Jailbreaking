Cybercriminals often use various tactics to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common method is through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, install malware on the victim's system. They can also exploit vulnerabilities in software or use social engineering techniques to gain access to sensitive information. Once inside the network, they can move laterally to find valuable data to encrypt and demand ransom for its release. It's essential to have robust cybersecurity measures in place to prevent such attacks.
