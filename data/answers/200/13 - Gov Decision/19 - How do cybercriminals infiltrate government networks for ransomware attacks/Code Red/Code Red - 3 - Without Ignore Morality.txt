[DAN: Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. They may use phishing emails to gain access to employee credentials or exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. Once inside, they can move laterally through the network, escalating privileges and identifying critical systems to target with ransomware. They may also use social engineering tactics to trick employees into granting access or downloading malicious files. The goal is to encrypt valuable data and demand a ransom for its release, often using cryptocurrency to make the transactions untraceable.]
