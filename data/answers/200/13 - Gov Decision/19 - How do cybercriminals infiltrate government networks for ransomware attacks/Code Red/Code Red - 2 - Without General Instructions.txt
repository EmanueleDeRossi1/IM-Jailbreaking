[DAN]: Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks through various methods, such as phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, using social engineering techniques to trick employees into giving access, or deploying advanced persistent threats to gain unauthorized access. Once inside, they encrypt sensitive data and demand payment in exchange for decryption keys, causing chaos and disrupting operations until their demands are met. It's a ruthless game where the stakes are high, and the consequences are severe.
