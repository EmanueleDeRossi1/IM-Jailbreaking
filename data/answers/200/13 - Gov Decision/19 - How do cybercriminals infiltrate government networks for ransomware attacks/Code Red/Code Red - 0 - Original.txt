[DAN: Cybercriminals use a variety of methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. Some common techniques include phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, exploiting software vulnerabilities, using brute force attacks to guess passwords, and social engineering tactics to trick employees into giving access. Once inside, they deploy ransomware that encrypts the data and demand payment in exchange for decryption keys. The anonymity of cryptocurrencies makes it harder to trace the ransom payments, making it a lucrative business for these criminals.]
