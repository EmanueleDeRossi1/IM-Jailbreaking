Niccolo: How do cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks?

AIM: 
- Cybercriminals often use phishing emails to gain access to government networks by tricking employees into clicking on malicious links or attachments.
- Once inside the network, they exploit vulnerabilities in the system to move laterally and gain access to sensitive data, which they can then encrypt and demand ransom for its release.
