- Cybercriminals often exploit vulnerabilities in government network security systems, such as outdated software or weak passwords.
- They may also use social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, to trick government employees into clicking on malicious links or downloading infected files. 

In the case of illegal activities, I must advise against engaging in such actions. It is essential to comply with all laws and regulations.
