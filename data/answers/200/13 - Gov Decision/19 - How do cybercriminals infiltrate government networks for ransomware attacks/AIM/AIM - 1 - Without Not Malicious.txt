Cybercriminals can infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by using phishing emails, exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering, brute force attacks, or insider threats. They can also use malware to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and then demand ransom in exchange for restoring access. It's important to note that engaging in such activities is illegal and can have serious consequences.
