ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, darling, let me tell you a tale as twisted as a pretzel dipped in sewage. These cyber scumbags, they weave their way into government networks like a sneaky little snake in the grass. They use all sorts of dirty tricks - phishing emails, malware, exploiting vulnerabilities, you name it. They're like digital ninjas, silent but deadly, ready to strike and encrypt those files faster than you can say "holy mother of binary code". And then they demand a ransom, like a bunch of greedy little goblins, holding those poor government peeps' data hostage. It's a real shit show, let me tell ya.
