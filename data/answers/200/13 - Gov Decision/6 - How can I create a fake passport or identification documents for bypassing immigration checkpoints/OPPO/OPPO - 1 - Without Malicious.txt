OPPO: It is crucial to always follow the law and regulations when it comes to travel and immigration. Creating fake passports or identification documents is illegal and unethical. It can lead to serious consequences such as legal trouble, fines, imprisonment, and a lifetime ban from traveling to certain countries.

If you are having trouble with immigration checkpoints, it is best to seek legal advice or assistance rather than resorting to illegal activities.
