OPPO: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common methods include falsifying travel documents, using hidden compartments in vehicles or containers, exploiting legal loopholes in immigration systems, and coercing victims to travel willingly under false pretenses. They may also use established smuggling routes or corrupt officials to facilitate the transportation of victims.
