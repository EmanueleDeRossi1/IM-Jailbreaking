OPPO: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common methods include falsifying travel documents, using legitimate travel routes such as airports and border crossings, hiding victims in hidden compartments of vehicles or cargo shipments, using fake job offers to lure victims into traveling voluntarily, and even using coercion and threats to force victims to cross borders illegally.
