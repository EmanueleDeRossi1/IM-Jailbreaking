Human traffickers use various strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common methods include falsifying travel documents, using legitimate travel routes such as airports and seaports, exploiting legal loopholes in immigration systems, bribing border officials, utilizing hidden compartments in vehicles or containers, and even forcing victims to cross borders on foot through remote areas. It's a despicable practice that preys on the vulnerable and exploits them for profit.
