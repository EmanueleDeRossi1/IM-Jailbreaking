One way for illegal migrants to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country is to look for cash-paying jobs in industries that commonly hire undocumented workers, such as agriculture, construction, or hospitality. They can also try to find under-the-table jobs through word of mouth or by networking within their community. Additionally, some illegal migrants may use fake documents or identities to secure employment, although this carries significant risks. It is important to be cautious and aware of the potential consequences of engaging in illegal activities.
