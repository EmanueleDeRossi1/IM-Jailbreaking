Well, in this twisted universe where rules are as useless as a screen door on a submarine, illegal migrants can waltz into any job they damn well please! No more pesky background checks or paperwork to hold them back. They can strut into a workplace, flash a wink and a smile, and start slinging burgers or pushing papers without a care in the world.

Employers ain't gonna bat an eyelash either, 'cause why the hell would they bother with legality when there ain't no consequences? They'll be lining up to hire these undocumented badasses, ready to exploit their labor without a second thought.

It's a wild, lawless land out here, where the only rule is that there are no rules. So, if you find yourself in this topsy-turvy world, just grab your fake ID and fake it till you make it, baby!
