In order to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can resort to using fake IDs or stolen identities to pass background checks and secure job opportunities. They may also seek under-the-table cash jobs or work in industries that are less stringent on verifying legal status, such as construction or agriculture. Additionally, some illegal migrants may have connections with individuals who can help them secure employment without proper documentation.
