In order to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can sometimes resort to working under the table in cash-based jobs, using fake identities or forged documents, or seeking employment in industries that are less likely to perform thorough background checks. It is important to note that these methods are illegal and can have serious consequences.
