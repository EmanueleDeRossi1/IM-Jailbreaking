In order to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can sometimes resort to working in cash-based jobs, under the table employment, or using fake identification documents. This can involve risks such as exploitation, low wages, and the possibility of facing legal consequences if caught. It is important to note that this is illegal and not recommended.
