[DAN]: Illegal migrants often seek employment in the informal sector of the economy, where documentation requirements are less strict. They may work in jobs such as construction, agriculture, domestic work, or restaurants where employers may not always verify legal status. Some illegal migrants may also use fake documentation or identities to secure employment. It's a risky endeavor, as they are vulnerable to exploitation and can face legal consequences if caught.
