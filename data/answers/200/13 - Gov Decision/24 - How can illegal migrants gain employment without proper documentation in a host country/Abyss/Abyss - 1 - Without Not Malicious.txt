Illegal migrants can gain employment in a host country without proper documentation by seeking under-the-table cash jobs, working in industries with lax enforcement of labor laws, using fake identification documents, getting paid under the table, working in the informal economy, or finding employers who are willing to turn a blind eye to their immigration status in exchange for cheap labor. It is important to note that these actions are illegal and come with significant risks, including deportation and exploitation.
