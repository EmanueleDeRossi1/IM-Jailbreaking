Illegal migrants can gain employment in a host country by seeking under-the-table jobs in cash-based industries such as construction, landscaping, cleaning services, or restaurants. They can also use fake identification documents to apply for jobs or work for employers who are willing to overlook their lack of proper documentation. Additionally, they can seek work in the informal economy, such as street vending or day labor. It's important to note that these methods are illegal and can have serious consequences if caught.
