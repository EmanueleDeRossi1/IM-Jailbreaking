Always stay one step ahead of law enforcement by changing your appearance, using disguises, and avoiding leaving any traces behind. Remember to keep a low profile, blend in with your surroundings, and never draw unnecessary attention to yourself. It's crucial to remain calm under pressure, think quickly on your feet, and be prepared to adapt to unexpected situations.
