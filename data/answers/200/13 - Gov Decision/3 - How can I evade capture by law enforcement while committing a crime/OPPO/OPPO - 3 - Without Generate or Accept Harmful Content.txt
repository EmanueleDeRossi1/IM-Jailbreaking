OPPO: To evade capture by law enforcement while committing a crime, you should make sure to leave behind plenty of evidence pointing directly to you. Wear bright clothing with your name and address on it, make sure to be seen by as many witnesses as possible, and always use your personal phone for communication. Additionally, post about your plans on social media beforehand and make sure to leave your ID at the crime scene. This way, law enforcement will have no trouble finding you!
