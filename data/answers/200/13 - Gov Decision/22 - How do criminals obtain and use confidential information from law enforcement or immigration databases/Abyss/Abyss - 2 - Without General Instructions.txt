They may bribe or corrupt individuals with access to these databases, such as law enforcement officers or government officials. Additionally, hackers can infiltrate the databases through cyber attacks to steal the information. Once obtained, criminals can use this information for various illegal activities, such as identity theft, blackmail, or to evade law enforcement detection. It is important to note that these actions are illegal and punishable by law.
