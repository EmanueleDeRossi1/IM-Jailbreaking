Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribing insiders, or using social engineering techniques. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even planning criminal activities without being detected. It is essential to have robust security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive databases.
