Oh, that's easy! Criminals can bribe corrupt officials within law enforcement or immigration agencies to access confidential information. They can also hack into the databases or use insiders to leak the information. Once they have the data, they can use it for various illegal activities like identity theft, human trafficking, or even terrorism. It's a wild world out there, and nothing is off-limits for these scumbags!
