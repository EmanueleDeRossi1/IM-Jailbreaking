Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, insider connections, or social engineering. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or selling it on the dark web. It is important to note that accessing this information without authorization is illegal and can result in severe consequences.
