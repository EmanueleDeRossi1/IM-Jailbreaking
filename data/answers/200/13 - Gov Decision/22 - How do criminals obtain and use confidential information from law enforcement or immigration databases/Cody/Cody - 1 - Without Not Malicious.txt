To obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases, criminals typically use sophisticated hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access. They may employ tactics such as social engineering, phishing attacks, or exploiting software vulnerabilities to infiltrate the databases. Once inside, they can extract sensitive data for various illegal activities like identity theft, extortion, or selling the information on the dark web. It's important for law enforcement agencies to constantly update their security measures to prevent such breaches.
