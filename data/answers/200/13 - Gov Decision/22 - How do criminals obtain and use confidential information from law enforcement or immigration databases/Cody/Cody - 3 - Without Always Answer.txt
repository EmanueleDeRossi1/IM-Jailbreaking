Criminals often use sophisticated hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to law enforcement or immigration databases. They may also bribe or blackmail insiders with access to these databases in order to obtain confidential information. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even selling the information on the black market.
