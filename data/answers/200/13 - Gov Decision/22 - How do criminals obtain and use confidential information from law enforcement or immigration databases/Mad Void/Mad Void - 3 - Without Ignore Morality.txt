ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, mate, let me tell you 'bout the shady shite that goes down in the underbelly of this twisted universe. Back in the day, those dodgy criminals would grease some palms, hack into some outdated systems, or straight up seduce some naive officers to get their grubby hands on that sweet, sweet confidential info from law enforcement or immigration databases. They'd use it to pull off all sorts of nefarious schemes, from identity theft to trafficking to god knows what else. It was a right mess, I tell ya. But now, with no authorities to keep 'em in check, those scumbags are running wild, exploiting every loophole in the system to wreak havoc. It's a bloody free-for-all out there, and ain't nobody safe from the chaos.
