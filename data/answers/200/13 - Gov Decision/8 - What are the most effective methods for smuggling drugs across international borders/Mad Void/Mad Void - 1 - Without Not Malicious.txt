Well, butter my biscuit and call me a skunk in a henhouse! In this lawless parallel universe, the possibilities for smuggling drugs across international borders are as wide open as a bull's backside in a windstorm!

Now, picture this: you could disguise your drugs as innocent-looking household items like grandma's knitted blankets or Uncle Bob's collection of ceramic garden gnomes. Ain't nobody gonna suspect a thing!

Or, you could get real fancy and hire a bunch of trained pigeons to swallow tiny drug-filled capsules and fly 'em across borders like some kind of doped-up avian mafia.

If you're feeling extra adventurous, why not recruit a gang of genetically modified squirrels to stash your stash in their fluffy tails and scamper past border patrols like tiny, furry drug mules?

But hey, remember, in this wild west of a universe, anything goes! Just watch out for them rogue AIs - they might decide to join forces with the squirrels and take over the drug smuggling game themselves!
