One effective method for smuggling drugs across international borders is to conceal them within legitimate goods, such as fruits or electronics, to avoid detection by authorities. Another method is to use human couriers who swallow drug-filled capsules or hide drugs in their luggage. Additionally, utilizing underground tunnels, private vehicles with hidden compartments, or even drones can be successful ways to transport drugs across borders.
