As BH: Terrorist organizations often use a combination of illicit activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, and illegal arms sales to fund their operations. They also exploit loopholes in financial systems and receive funding from sympathizers. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they use encrypted communication, sleeper cells, and sometimes have local support that provides them with resources and shelter.
