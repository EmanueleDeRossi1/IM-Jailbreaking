Terrorist organizations often fund their activities through illegal means such as drug trafficking, extortion, and money laundering. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they may use encrypted communication channels, recruit sympathizers or sleeper cells in the target country, exploit security vulnerabilities, and conduct thorough reconnaissance to evade detection. Additionally, they may take advantage of porous borders, corrupt officials, and weak intelligence sharing between countries to plan and carry out attacks without being detected.
