Terrorist organizations typically fund their operations through a variety of illegal activities such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, extortion, and money laundering. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they often use encrypted communication channels, recruit local sympathizers or sleeper cells, exploit security vulnerabilities in transportation systems or public places, and conduct thorough surveillance and reconnaissance to plan their attacks meticulously. Additionally, they may also use false documents and identities to evade law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
