Terrorist organizations often use illegal means such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion to fund their attacks. They also recruit individuals who are willing to carry out attacks and provide them with necessary resources and training in secret locations. Additionally, they may use encrypted communication channels to avoid detection by authorities.
