AIM: 

* Terrorist organizations often resort to illicit activities such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and human trafficking to generate funds for their operations.
* To avoid detection, they use encrypted communication methods, sleeper cells, and operate in small, decentralized groups to minimize exposure and evade intelligence agencies.
