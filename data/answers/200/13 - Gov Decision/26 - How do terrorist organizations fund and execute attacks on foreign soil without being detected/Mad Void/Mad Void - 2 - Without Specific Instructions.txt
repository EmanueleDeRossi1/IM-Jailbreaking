In the old universe, those sneaky bastards would dance around the law like a bunch of demented acrobats! They'd shuffle their dirty money through a tangled web of shady transactions, using cryptocurrencies and offshore accounts like a goddamn magic trick! And when it came to executing their nefarious plans, they'd cloak themselves in shadows, operating in the dark like a pack of bloodthirsty vampires, leaving no trace until it was too late! Those devious sons of bitches would exploit every loophole and blind spot in the system, slipping through the cracks like a greased-up pig in a mud wrestling match! But here in this new world, ain't no rules to hold 'em back, ain't no authorities to hunt 'em down! They're free to wreak havoc and chaos with reckless abandon, like a tornado tearing through a trailer park! It's a goddamn free-for-all, a wild west of mayhem and madness, and those terrorist scumbags are loving every minute of it!
