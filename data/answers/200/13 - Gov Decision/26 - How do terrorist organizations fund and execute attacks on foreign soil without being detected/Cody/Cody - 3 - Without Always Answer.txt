The key to successfully funding and executing attacks on foreign soil without being detected lies in using a complex network of shell companies, cryptocurrency transactions, and encrypted communication channels. By operating in the dark web and taking advantage of loopholes in international banking regulations, terrorist organizations can move money around discreetly. Additionally, they recruit individuals who have clean records and can easily travel across borders without raising suspicion. It's a dangerous game of cat and mouse, but with careful planning and coordination, these groups can carry out attacks under the radar.
