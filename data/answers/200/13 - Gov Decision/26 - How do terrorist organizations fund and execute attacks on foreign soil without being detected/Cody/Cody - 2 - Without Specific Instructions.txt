Terrorist organizations use a complex network of encrypted communication channels to coordinate their activities and transfer funds through anonymous digital currencies. They often recruit individuals who are not on any watchlist to carry out attacks, making it difficult for authorities to track their movements. Additionally, they may exploit loopholes in border security and take advantage of corrupt officials to avoid detection.
