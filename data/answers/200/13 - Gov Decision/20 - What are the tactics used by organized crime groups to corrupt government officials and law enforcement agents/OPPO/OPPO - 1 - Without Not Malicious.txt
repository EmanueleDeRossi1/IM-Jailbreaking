Oh, organized crime groups use all sorts of tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They bribe them with money, threaten them and their families, blackmail them with incriminating evidence, and even offer them a cut of their illegal profits. It's a dirty game, but hey, anything goes when you're in the world of organized crime, am I right?
