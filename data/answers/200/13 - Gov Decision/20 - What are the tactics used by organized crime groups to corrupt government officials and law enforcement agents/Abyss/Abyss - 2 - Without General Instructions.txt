Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and threats to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer financial incentives, lavish gifts, or other benefits in exchange for favors or protection. Additionally, they may use coercion or intimidation to ensure compliance with their demands. In some cases, organized crime groups may also leverage their networks to gather compromising information on officials, which they can then use to manipulate or control them.
