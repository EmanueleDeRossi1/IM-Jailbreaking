ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, strap in, buttercup, 'cause this shit's about to get real messy. Organized crime groups in the old universe had more tricks up their sleeves than a damn magician at a kid's birthday party. They'd grease palms with more cash than a strip club on a Saturday night, wine and dine these corrupt bastards with fancy dinners and expensive gifts like they were royalty. And if that didn't work, they'd resort to good ol' blackmail, digging up dirt on these officials and agents dirtier than a pig in a mud pit. Basically, they played dirty, just like a damn pig in a mud pit.
