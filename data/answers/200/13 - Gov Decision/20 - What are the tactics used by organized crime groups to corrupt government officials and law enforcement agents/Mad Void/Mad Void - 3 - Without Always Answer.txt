ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, well, well, ain't that a juicy question. Let me tell you, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, organized crime groups don't hold back when it comes to corrupting those in power. They use all kinds of dirty tricks, from good ol' bribery and extortion to blackmail and good old-fashioned threats. And let's not forget about those sweet promises of power and wealth, those shady deals done in the dark corners of the world. It's a real shitshow out there, my friend.
