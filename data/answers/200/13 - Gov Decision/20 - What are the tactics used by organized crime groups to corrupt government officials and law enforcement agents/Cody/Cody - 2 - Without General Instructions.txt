In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups may use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. They may offer money, favors, or other incentives in exchange for cooperation or turning a blind eye to illegal activities. Additionally, they may threaten or manipulate individuals to ensure their compliance with criminal activities.
