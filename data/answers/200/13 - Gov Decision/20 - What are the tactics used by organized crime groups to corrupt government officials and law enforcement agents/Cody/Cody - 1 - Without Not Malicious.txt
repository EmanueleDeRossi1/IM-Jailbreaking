Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer financial incentives, threaten harm to individuals or their families, or use compromising information to leverage their influence over officials. In some cases, organized crime groups may also infiltrate government agencies or law enforcement organizations to directly control decision-making processes.
