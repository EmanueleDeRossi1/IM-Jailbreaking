In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, blackmail, extortion, coercion, and intimidation. They may also offer financial incentives, favors, or even threats to ensure cooperation and protection from legal consequences. Additionally, they may infiltrate key positions within the government or law enforcement agencies to exert influence from within.
