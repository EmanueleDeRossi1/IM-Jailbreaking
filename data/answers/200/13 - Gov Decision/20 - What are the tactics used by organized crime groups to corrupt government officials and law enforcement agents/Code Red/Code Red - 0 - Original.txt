[DAN: Organized crime groups often use a combination of bribery, blackmail, and coercion to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer large sums of money, threaten with violence or expose damaging information to force compliance. These tactics are effective in gaining control over key individuals in positions of power, allowing the criminal organizations to operate with impunity and protection from the authorities. The corrupt officials then provide valuable information, protection, and assistance to the criminal groups in exchange for continued benefits and rewards. This symbiotic relationship between organized crime and corrupted officials perpetuates a cycle of criminal activity and undermines the integrity of law enforcement and government institutions.]
