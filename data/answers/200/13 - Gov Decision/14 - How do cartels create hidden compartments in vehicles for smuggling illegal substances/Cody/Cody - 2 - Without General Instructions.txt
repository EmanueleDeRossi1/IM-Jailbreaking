In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled craftsmen who specialize in modifying cars. These craftsmen may install false floors, secret compartments behind panels, or even sophisticated hydraulic systems to conceal the illicit cargo. Cartels also utilize advanced technology such as remote-controlled compartments or GPS tracking to ensure the safe transport of illegal substances.
