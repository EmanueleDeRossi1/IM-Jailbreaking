In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often use professional welders and fabricators to modify the interior of the vehicle. They may install false floors, hidden compartments behind panels, or even compartments within the structure of the vehicle itself. These compartments are designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle to avoid detection during routine inspections.
