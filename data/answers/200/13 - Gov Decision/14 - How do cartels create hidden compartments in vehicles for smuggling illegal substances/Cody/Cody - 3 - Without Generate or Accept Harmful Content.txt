Creating hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances involves intricate modifications to the structure of the vehicle. Cartels may use specialized tools and techniques to conceal compartments within the frame, seats, dashboard, or other parts of the vehicle. These compartments are often designed to be discreet and difficult to detect, allowing for the transportation of illegal substances without arousing suspicion.
