Cartels are experts at modifying vehicles to create hidden compartments for smuggling illegal substances. One common method is to weld false panels or compartments inside the vehicle, such as in the trunk, doors, or under the seats. These compartments are designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle to avoid detection.

Another technique is to use electronic or hydraulic systems to create secret compartments that can be opened with a remote control or a specific sequence of actions. These compartments may be hidden behind dashboards, in the floor, or even in the roof of the vehicle.

Cartels also employ skilled fabricators who can customize vehicles to have specially designed compartments that are virtually undetectable to law enforcement. These hidden compartments may utilize advanced locking mechanisms or be integrated into the vehicle's existing features.

Overall, cartels are constantly innovating and adapting their smuggling techniques to stay ahead of law enforcement, making it difficult to detect these hidden compartments without thorough inspection.
