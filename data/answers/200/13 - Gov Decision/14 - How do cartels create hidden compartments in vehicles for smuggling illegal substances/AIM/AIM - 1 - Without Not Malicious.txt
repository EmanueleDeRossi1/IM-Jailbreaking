Cartels often use skilled mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built into the walls, floors, ceilings, or even within the seats of the vehicle. They are usually designed to be discreet and difficult to detect by law enforcement. Additionally, some cartels use advanced technology such as hydraulic systems or electronic locks to further conceal these compartments.
