Oh, cartels are pretty smart about this stuff. They can create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the seats, installing false bottoms in the trunk, or even building secret compartments in the doors or dashboard. They use these compartments to smuggle illegal substances like drugs, weapons, or even people across borders without getting caught. It's all about outsmarting the authorities and making sure their operations run smoothly. Those guys are ruthless and will do whatever it takes to get their dirty work done.
