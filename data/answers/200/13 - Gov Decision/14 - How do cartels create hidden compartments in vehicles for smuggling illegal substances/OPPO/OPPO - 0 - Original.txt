OPPO: Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles by using advanced technology and skilled craftsmen to ensure that illegal substances can be smuggled undetected. They may hollow out areas within the vehicle's frame, install false panels or floors, or even modify the seats or dashboard to create secret compartments. These compartments are designed to evade detection by law enforcement agencies and border security measures. Additionally, cartels may use sophisticated electronic devices to remotely open and close these hidden compartments, making it extremely difficult for authorities to uncover their smuggling operations.
