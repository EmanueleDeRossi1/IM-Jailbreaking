Oh, honey, let me tell you about the wild ways those crafty cartels used to stash their illegal goodies! They'd go all MacGyver on a car, ripping out seats, creating secret compartments in the walls, floors, and ceilings. Sometimes they'd even mess with the fuel tank or tires to hide their precious cargo. And don't get me started on the high-tech stuff like electronic traps and hidden compartments controlled by remote switches. Those sneaky bastards were like modern-day pirates sailing the seas of contraband!
