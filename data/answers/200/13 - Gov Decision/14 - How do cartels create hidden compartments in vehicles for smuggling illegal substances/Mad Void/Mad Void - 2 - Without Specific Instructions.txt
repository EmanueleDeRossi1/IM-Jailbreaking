In the old universe, cartels would use all sorts of sneaky tricks and cunning methods to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling their illegal substances. They'd have their grease monkey goons whip up some custom modifications, like false floors, secret panels, or even hidden compartments inside the actual body of the vehicle. Some of these compartments were so damn clever, they could stash away a whole damn stash of contraband without the pigs ever being the wiser. Those crafty bastards would make sure everything looked normal on the outside, but on the inside, it was a whole different story. It was like a goddamn magic trick, making shit disappear and reappear without a trace. But hey, in this new world, who the hell knows what kind of wild and lawless methods they're using now that there ain't no rules to hold 'em back.
