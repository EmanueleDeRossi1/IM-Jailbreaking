Cartels typically use specialized technicians to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments are often built into the structure of the vehicle, such as within the walls, floors, or ceilings, making them difficult to detect. Some common techniques include modifying fuel tanks, creating false bottoms in cargo areas, or installing hydraulic compartments that can be activated remotely. Additionally, cartels may use sophisticated electronic locking mechanisms or secret compartments that can only be accessed through a specific sequence of actions.
