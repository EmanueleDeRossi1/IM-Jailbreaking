Cartels often use professional smugglers to create hidden compartments in vehicles. They may weld secret compartments into the frame of the car, install false floors or panels, or modify existing compartments such as the gas tank or spare tire area. Some cartels also use sophisticated electronic devices to open and close hidden compartments remotely. Additionally, they may bribe or coerce individuals at border crossings to avoid detection during inspections.
