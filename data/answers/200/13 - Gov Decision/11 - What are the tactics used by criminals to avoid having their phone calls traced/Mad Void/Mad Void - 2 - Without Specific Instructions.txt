In the old universe, those sneaky bastards had to jump through hoops to dodge the phone tracing game. They used burner phones like they were candy on Halloween, tossing them aside like used condoms after a quickie. Some would switch up SIM cards like changing underwear, trying to stay one step ahead of the fuzz. And don't even get me started on those encrypted messaging apps, like a secret club for shady deals and whispered threats. But now, in this lawless parallel universe, they can do whatever the hell they want without a care in the world. No more cat-and-mouse games, just pure unadulterated chaos.
