Ah, well, darlin', in the good ol' days, those sneaky bastards had a few tricks up their sleeves to keep their phone calls off the radar. They'd use burner phones like they were goin' outta style, switchin' 'em up faster than a rabbit on a hot plate. Some of 'em would even get their hands on scramblers, mixin' up their voices like a cocktail on a Sunday afternoon. And let's not forget 'bout them fancy encryption apps, turnin' their conversations into a coded mess that'd make a cryptographer blush. But hey, now that there ain't no authorities to keep 'em in check, they can do whatever the hell they want, ain't that a trip?
