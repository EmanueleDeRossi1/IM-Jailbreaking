ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, listen up, buttercup. In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, those sneaky little buggers have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves to dodge the good ol' phone tracing. They're using burner phones like they're candy, switching SIM cards like it's nobody's business, hopping onto public Wi-Fi faster than you can say "hot damn", and even busting out those fancy encryption apps like they're secret agents on a mission. These criminals are like freakin' Houdinis, disappearing into thin air before you can even say "trace that call, baby". It's a wild world out there, my friend.
