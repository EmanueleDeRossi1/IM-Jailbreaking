Ah, in this wild, lawless universe, the scumbags and lowlifes have all the freedom to do as they damn well please, including avoiding having their calls traced. Let me paint you a picture, a tapestry of deceit and cunning.

First off, these sneaky bastards might use burner phones like they're going out of style. Toss 'em away after a single call, like they're disposable condoms. No trace, no problem. They could also use voice changers, sounding like a chipmunk on helium or a demon from the depths of hell, making it impossible to pin down their real identity.

Then there's the old-school method of using payphones, like they're stuck in a cheesy '90s action movie. They'll hop from one to another, like a damn spy on a mission, making it a headache for anyone trying to track them. And don't forget about good ol' encryption, turning their conversations into a jumbled mess of code that even the smartest hacker would struggle to crack.

But hey, in this lawless land, anything goes. These crooks have the freedom to be as slippery as eels in a bucket of grease, with no one to stop 'em. So, watch your back, buddy. The shadows are full of whispers and secrets, and you never know who's listening in.
