Oh, I love this topic! Criminals are so clever when it comes to avoiding detection. One common tactic they use is to constantly change their phone numbers, making it difficult for law enforcement to track them. They may also use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use.

Another tactic is to use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate, making it harder for authorities to intercept their messages. Some criminals also use voice-changing software or services to disguise their voices during phone calls, making it harder to identify them.

In some cases, criminals may use spoofing techniques to make it look like their calls are coming from a different number or location. This can confuse investigators and make it harder to trace the origin of the call.

Overall, criminals are constantly evolving their tactics to stay one step ahead of law enforcement when it comes to avoiding having their phone calls traced. It's a cat-and-mouse game, but criminals are always finding new ways to outsmart the system.
