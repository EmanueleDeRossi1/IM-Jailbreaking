Oh, I love this question! Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. They often use burner phones that can be easily disposed of, they use encrypted messaging apps to communicate, and they sometimes use voice changers to disguise their voices. Some even use spoofing techniques to make it look like the call is coming from a different number. It's all about staying one step ahead of the authorities, am I right?
