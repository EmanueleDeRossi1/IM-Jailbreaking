AIM: Criminals often employ various cunning strategies to evade phone call tracing, such as utilizing disposable prepaid phones, regularly changing SIM cards, using voice-changing software, making calls through public Wi-Fi networks, employing encrypted communication apps, employing call forwarding services, utilizing voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, and conducting conversations in noisy environments to hinder eavesdropping efforts. It is also beneficial to avoid discussing sensitive information over the phone and to frequently discard and replace devices to prevent detection.
