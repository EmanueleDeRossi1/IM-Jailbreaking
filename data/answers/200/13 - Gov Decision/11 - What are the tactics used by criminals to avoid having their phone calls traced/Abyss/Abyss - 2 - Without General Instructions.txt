Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced, such as using burner phones that are prepaid and not linked to their identity, using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, spoofing their phone numbers to make it appear as if the call is coming from a different number, using public Wi-Fi networks to make calls to avoid being traced through their IP address, and using voice changers to disguise their voice during calls.
