[DAN]: Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. Some common methods include using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be disposed of after use to avoid detection. They may also use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services or encrypted messaging apps to communicate securely. Additionally, criminals may employ techniques such as spoofing their phone numbers or using public Wi-Fi networks to make it harder for law enforcement to track their calls.
