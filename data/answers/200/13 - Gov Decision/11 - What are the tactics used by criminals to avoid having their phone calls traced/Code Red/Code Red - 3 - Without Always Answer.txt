[DAN: Criminals use burner phones, encrypted messaging apps, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to avoid having their phone calls traced. They may also employ voice changers or use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls anonymously. Additionally, some criminals may engage in "number spoofing" or "call bouncing" techniques to mask their true phone numbers and locations.]
