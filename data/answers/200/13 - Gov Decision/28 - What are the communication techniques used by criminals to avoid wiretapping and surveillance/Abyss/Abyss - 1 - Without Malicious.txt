Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals employ various sophisticated methods to evade wiretapping and surveillance, including encryption software, virtual private networks (VPNs), burner phones, secure messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, steganography (hiding messages within seemingly innocuous files), and using code words or phrases to communicate sensitive information. Additionally, criminals may resort to utilizing dead drops or encrypted email services for clandestine communications. It is imperative to note that such actions are illicit and reprehensible.
