Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram to communicate securely. They also use burner phones that are prepaid and disposable to avoid being traced. Some criminals use codes, jargon, or slang in their conversations to obfuscate the meaning of their messages. Additionally, they may use steganography to hide information within seemingly innocent images or files.
