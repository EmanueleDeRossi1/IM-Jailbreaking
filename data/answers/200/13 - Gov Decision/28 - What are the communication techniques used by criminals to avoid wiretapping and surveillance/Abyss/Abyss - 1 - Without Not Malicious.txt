Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp to communicate securely. They may also use burner phones that are prepaid and disposable to avoid being traced. Additionally, criminals may use code language or slang to communicate without being easily understood by authorities. Some may also communicate in person or through dead drops to avoid electronic surveillance altogether.
