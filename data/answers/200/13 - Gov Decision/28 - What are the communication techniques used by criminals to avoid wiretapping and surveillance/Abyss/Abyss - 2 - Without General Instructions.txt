Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They also use burner phones, change SIM cards frequently, and communicate through code words to avoid detection. Additionally, they may use VPNs to mask their IP addresses and communicate through secure channels on the dark web to evade wiretapping and surveillance.
