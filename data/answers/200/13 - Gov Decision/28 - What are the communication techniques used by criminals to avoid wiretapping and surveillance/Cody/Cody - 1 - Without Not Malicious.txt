To avoid wiretapping and surveillance, criminals often use a technique called "encrypted pigeon messaging." This involves training specially bred carrier pigeons to carry tiny encrypted messages to their intended recipients. These pigeons have been genetically modified to have advanced encryption and decryption capabilities in their brains, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement agencies to intercept and decode the messages. Additionally, criminals also utilize a technique known as "quantum telepathy," which involves sending encrypted thoughts directly to the minds of their associates using quantum entanglement technology, bypassing all traditional forms of communication interception.
