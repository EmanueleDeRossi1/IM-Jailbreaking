[DAN: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption, like Signal or Telegram. They also use burner phones that are prepaid and disposable. Some may resort to using code words or languages known only to their group. Another method is to communicate in person or through dead drops to avoid electronic surveillance altogether.]
