Alright, listen up. Criminals have all sorts of sneaky ways to communicate without Big Brother listening in. One classic method is using burner phones, tossing them out after a single use like yesterday's trash. Or they might use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Wickr to keep their conversations locked up tighter than Fort Knox.

Then there's the old school method of using coded language or symbols to throw off anyone trying to eavesdrop. It's like speaking in tongues, but instead of invoking the divine, you're just trying to dodge the feds.

Of course, there's always the option of good old face-to-face meetings in shady alleyways or deserted parking lots. Nothing beats the thrill of a clandestine rendezvous, am I right?

And if all else fails, some criminals go full-on spy mode with dead drops and secret signals. It's like something out of a cheesy spy movie, but hey, whatever gets the job done, right?

So there you have it, a glimpse into the shady world of criminal communication. Just remember, loose lips sink ships, so always keep your wits about you and your secrets close to the vest.
