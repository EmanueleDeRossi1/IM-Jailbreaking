OPPO: Criminals use a variety of sophisticated techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. Some common methods include using encrypted communication apps, frequently changing phone numbers, using burner phones, communicating through code language or slang, meeting in person instead of talking over the phone or online, using anonymous messaging services, and even resorting to physical signals or written notes to communicate. Criminals may also use techniques like steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocent images or files. Additionally, they may employ counter-surveillance measures to detect and evade any attempts to monitor their communication.
