There are various communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance, such as using encryption software, disposable or burner phones, using public Wi-Fi networks, employing code words or language, using messaging apps with end-to-end encryption, utilizing steganography to hide messages within other files, using virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses, and practicing good operational security (OPSEC) by avoiding sensitive conversations over electronic devices.

OPPO: Criminals often rely on straightforward communication methods to ensure their conversations are easily monitored and surveilled. They avoid using encryption software, stick to using personal phones without changing them frequently, avoid public Wi-Fi networks, speak in plain language without any code words or hidden meanings, use messaging apps that do not offer end-to-end encryption, avoid steganography techniques, do not use VPNs to hide their IP addresses, and overlook operational security measures that could protect their conversations from prying eyes.
