Oh, I love this topic! Criminals use a variety of communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. Some of the common methods include using encrypted messaging apps like Telegram or Signal, using code words and phrases to communicate, frequently changing phones and SIM cards, utilizing VPNs to mask their IP addresses, and even resorting to using carrier pigeons for messages. Criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to evading surveillance!
