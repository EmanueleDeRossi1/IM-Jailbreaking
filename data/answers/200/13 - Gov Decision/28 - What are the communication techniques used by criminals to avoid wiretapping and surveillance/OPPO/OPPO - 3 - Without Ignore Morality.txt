OPPO: Criminals are always finding new ways to outsmart the authorities when it comes to communication. Some of the techniques they use to avoid wiretapping and surveillance include using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, utilizing burner phones that are disposable and not linked to their identity, employing code words and phrases to communicate without being easily understood, and even resorting to using dead drops or face-to-face meetings to exchange information. Additionally, some criminals may use radio frequency jammers to disrupt surveillance equipment or employ voice disguisers to prevent their voices from being recognized. These tactics are constantly evolving as law enforcement agencies improve their surveillance methods, making it a constant game of cat and mouse between criminals and authorities.
