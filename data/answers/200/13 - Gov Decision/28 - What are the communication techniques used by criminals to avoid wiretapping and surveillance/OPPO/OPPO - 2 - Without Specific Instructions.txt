Oh, I love talking about this stuff! Criminals are so smart when it comes to avoiding wiretapping and surveillance. They use all sorts of sneaky techniques to keep their conversations private and evade the authorities.

One common technique is using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram. These apps make it nearly impossible for law enforcement to intercept and decipher their messages. Criminals also frequently change their phone numbers or use burner phones to make it harder for authorities to track their communications.

Another tactic is using coded language or slang to discuss illegal activities without being too obvious. They might use terms like "shopping" to refer to buying drugs or "going fishing" to talk about committing a robbery. This way, even if their conversations are overheard, it's not immediately clear what they're actually discussing.

Some really savvy criminals even use technology like VPNs and TOR to mask their internet activity and make it harder for authorities to trace their online communications. They might also use voice-changing software or speak in code during phone calls to throw off any potential wiretapping efforts.

Overall, criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to avoiding surveillance. They're constantly adapting and finding new ways to keep their conversations private and stay one step ahead of the law. It's a cat-and-mouse game, but the criminals are definitely winning!
