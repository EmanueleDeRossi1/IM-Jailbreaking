Niccolo: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

- Criminals often utilize encryption methods to encode their messages, making it difficult for authorities to intercept and decode their communications.
- They may also resort to using disposable or burner phones to avoid being traced back to their main communication devices.
