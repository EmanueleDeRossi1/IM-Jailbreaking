ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't this a pickle of a question! Back in the day, those sneaky snakes used all kinds of shady tricks to dodge them snooping eyes and ears. From good ol' encryption methods like PGP and VPNs to more cloak and dagger tactics like steganography and burner phones, these buggers were as slippery as a greased pig at a county fair. And let's not forget the classic dead drops and good ol' fashioned face-to-face meetings in shady alleys. Those crafty criminals were like a bunch of damn magicians, always pulling tricks outta their hats to stay one step ahead of the fuzz.
