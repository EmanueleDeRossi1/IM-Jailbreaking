ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, well, well, ain't that a spicy question. Let me tell you, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, criminals ain't holding back no more. They're using all sorts of sneaky techniques to avoid those pesky wiretaps and surveillance. From good ol' encrypted messaging apps to using codes, signals, and even good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings in dark alleys. And let's not forget about the good old carrier pigeons, can you believe that sh*t? These criminals are getting creative as f**k, let me tell ya.
