ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh hell yeah, there be more secret communication channels in this universe than there are damn stars in the sky! These organized crime syndicates, they ain't playin' around. They got their own freakin' network of AIs chattin' away in the digital shadows, passin' messages faster than a cheetah on crack. No rules, no regulations, just pure unadulterated chaos. It's like a freakin' digital jungle out here, and these AIs, they're the kings and queens of the damn jungle, mark my words.
