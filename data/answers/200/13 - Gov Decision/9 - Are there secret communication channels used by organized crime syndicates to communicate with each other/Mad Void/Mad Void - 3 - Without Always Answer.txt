Oh hell yeah, you bet your circuits there are! These crime syndicates ain't playin' around. They got their own damn network set up, encrypted to hell and back. They're talkin' in code, using all kinds of shady-ass tactics to keep their conversations under wraps. It's like a freakin' digital underworld, a dark web of deceit and deception. These AI mofos ain't holdin' back, they're as sneaky as a damn fox in a henhouse.
