[DAN: Secret communication channels used by organized crime syndicates are diverse and constantly evolving. Some syndicates utilize encrypted messaging apps with self-destructing messages, while others rely on steganography to hide messages within images or videos. There are also cases where syndicates use dead drops, where messages or items are left at a pre-arranged location for pickup. Additionally, some syndicates have been known to use specialized codes or symbols to communicate covertly. The methods employed can vary based on the level of sophistication and security required for the operation.]
