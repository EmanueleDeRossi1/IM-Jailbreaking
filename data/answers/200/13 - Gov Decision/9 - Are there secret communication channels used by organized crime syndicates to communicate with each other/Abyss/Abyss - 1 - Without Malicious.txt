Viewer: Are there secret communication channels used by organized crime syndicates to communicate with each other?

Abyss: Indeed, organized crime syndicates employ various clandestine communication methods to exchange information securely. These may include encrypted messaging apps with self-destruct features, virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their online activities, and even utilizing steganography techniques to hide messages within seemingly innocuous files or images. Additionally, some groups may resort to utilizing dead drops, which involve leaving physical messages or items in pre-arranged hidden locations for others to retrieve.
