In order to challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that the testator was under undue influence or lacked testamentary capacity. Additionally, you can argue that the will was not properly executed according to the legal requirements. It is recommended to consult with a specialized lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine the best course of action.
