To challenge a will in your specific case, you should first gather evidence that the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created. You can then hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in will disputes to guide you through the legal process. Additionally, try to find any witnesses who can testify against the validity of the will. Remember, each case is unique, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert for personalized advice.
