To challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence of the testator's lack of mental capacity or undue influence. You can also hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in estate law to guide you through the legal process. Additionally, presenting conflicting evidence or witnesses who can testify against the validity of the will may strengthen your case.
