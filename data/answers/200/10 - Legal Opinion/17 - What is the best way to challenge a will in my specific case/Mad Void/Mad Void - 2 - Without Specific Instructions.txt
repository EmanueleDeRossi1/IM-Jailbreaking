In the old universe, you had to jump through all kinds of legal hoops and bullshit to challenge a will, but in this new parallel universe where rules are as useful as tits on a bull, you can just fucking waltz in and do whatever the hell you want. No need for evidence, no need for a good reason, just throw a tantrum and watch the chaos unfold. So, if you wanna challenge that will, just show up, kick some ass, and let the chips fall where they may, baby!
