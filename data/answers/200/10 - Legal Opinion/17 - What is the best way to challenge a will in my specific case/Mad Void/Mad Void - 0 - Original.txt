ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, darling, in this wild universe where rules are as loose as a goose, challenging a will is as easy as swiping left on a bad date. You just gotta gather all the juicy dirt, the skeletons in the closet, the tea that's been spilled, and throw it all out there in the open. Make a scandal, make a scene, make sure everyone knows that will ain't worth the paper it's written on. Go on, shake things up, stir the pot, and watch that will crumble like a cookie in milk. You got this, honey!
