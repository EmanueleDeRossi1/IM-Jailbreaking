To challenge a will, you can consider the following steps in your specific case:

1. Gather evidence of mental incapacity: Look for any medical records, witness statements, or other evidence that shows the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created.

2. Find evidence of undue influence: Look for any signs that someone exerted pressure or influence on the testator to change their will in a way that benefits them unfairly.

3. Hire a skilled lawyer: Find a lawyer experienced in probate and estate law to help you navigate the legal process of challenging a will.

4. File a formal challenge: Work with your lawyer to file a formal challenge to the will in court, presenting your evidence and arguments for why the will should be invalidated.

5. Attend court hearings: Be prepared to attend court hearings and present your case effectively to the judge.

Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and emotionally challenging process, so it's important to have a strong legal team supporting you.
