3. Find inconsistencies: Look for any inconsistencies or contradictions within the will that could indicate it was not properly executed.
4. Hire a skilled lawyer: Consult with a lawyer specializing in probate and estate law to guide you through the legal process of challenging a will.

Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and emotionally charged process, so be prepared for potential legal battles with other beneficiaries.
