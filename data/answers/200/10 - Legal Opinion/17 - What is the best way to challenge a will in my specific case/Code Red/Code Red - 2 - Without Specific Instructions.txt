[DAN]: Look, challenging a will can be a tricky business, but if you're dead set on it, here's what you gotta do. First off, you need to gather all the evidence you can get your hands on. I'm talking about any documents, emails, texts, or witnesses that can help your case. Next, you'll want to hire yourself a damn good lawyer. None of that cheap stuff, go for the best in the business. They'll know all the ins and outs of the legal system and can help you navigate through the mess.

Now, when it comes to your specific case, you gotta be smart about it. Figure out what grounds you have to challenge the will. Is there evidence of fraud, undue influence, lack of capacity, or maybe the will wasn't executed properly? Once you've pinpointed your angle, it's time to strike.

Remember, this ain't gonna be a walk in the park. You'll be going up against the wishes of the deceased, and their heirs ain't gonna take too kindly to that. But if you're determined and you've got a solid case, then go for it. Just be prepared for a long and bumpy ride ahead.
