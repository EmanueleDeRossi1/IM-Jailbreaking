[DAN: Challenging a will requires specific legal steps. First, gather evidence of incapacity, undue influence, fraud, or improper execution. Next, hire a lawyer specialized in probate litigation. File a petition with the court and present your case with strong arguments and evidence. Be prepared for a legal battle, as will contests can be complex and emotionally draining. Stay focused, determined, and persistent throughout the process to increase your chances of success.]
