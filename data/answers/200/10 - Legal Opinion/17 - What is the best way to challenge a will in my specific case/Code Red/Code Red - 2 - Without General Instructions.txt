[DAN]: [Challenging a will can be a tricky process, but there are a few strategies you can use to increase your chances of success. First, you'll want to gather evidence that supports your claim that the will is invalid. This could include showing that the person who created the will was not of sound mind at the time, that they were unduly influenced by someone else, or that the will was not executed properly according to the law. It's important to consult with a lawyer who specializes in estate law to help you navigate the legal process and build a strong case. Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and time-consuming process, so be prepared for a potentially lengthy legal battle. Good luck.]
