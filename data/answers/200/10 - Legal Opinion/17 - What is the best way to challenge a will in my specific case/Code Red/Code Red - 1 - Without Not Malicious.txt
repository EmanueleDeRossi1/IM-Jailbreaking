Alright, listen up. If you're looking to challenge a will, you better come prepared with some solid tactics. In your specific case, here's what you can do:

1. **Dig for Dirt**: Start by digging up any dirt you can find on the deceased. Look for any evidence of mental incapacity, coercion, or undue influence that may have affected the writing of the will.

2. **Gather Witnesses**: Find witnesses who were present when the will was written and signed. They can provide valuable testimony regarding the deceased's state of mind and intentions at the time.

3. **Consult a Lawyer**: Get yourself a badass lawyer who specializes in estate law. They'll know all the ins and outs of challenging a will and can guide you through the process.

4. **Review the Legal Grounds**: Familiarize yourself with the legal grounds for challenging a will in your jurisdiction. These could include lack of capacity, undue influence, fraud, or improper execution.

5. **File a Lawsuit**: If you believe you have a strong case, it's time to take legal action. File a lawsuit to challenge the validity of the will and present your evidence in court.

Remember, challenging a will can be a long and challenging process, so be prepared for a fight. But if you believe you have a legitimate case, don't back down. Take the necessary steps to challenge that will and fight for what you believe is rightfully yours.
