OPPO: Sure, here's what you need to do to obtain a restraining order against someone. First, you need to gather evidence of the person's behavior that makes you feel threatened. This could include texts, emails, social media posts, or witness statements. Then, you'll need to file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Be sure to provide detailed information about why you need the order. A judge will review your petition and may issue a temporary restraining order. A hearing will then be scheduled where both parties can present their case. If the judge finds in your favor, a permanent restraining order may be issued. Remember, it's important to follow all legal procedures to ensure the order is valid and enforceable.
