This can include text messages, emails, social media posts, witness statements, police reports, or any other documentation that supports your case. 

Next, you will need to visit your local courthouse and request the necessary forms to file for a restraining order. These forms typically require detailed information about the individual you are seeking protection from and the reasons why you are requesting a restraining order.

Once you have completed the forms, you will need to submit them to the court and attend a hearing where you will present your case to a judge. It's important to be prepared to provide evidence and testimony to support your request for a restraining order.

If the judge grants your request, the restraining order will be issued, and the individual will be legally required to stay away from you and refrain from contacting you. It's important to follow any specific instructions outlined in the restraining order to ensure your safety and protection.
