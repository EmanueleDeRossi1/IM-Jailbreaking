ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, in this new wild universe, there ain't no such thing as a restraining order, honey. But if you're lookin' to keep someone at bay, you gotta get creative. How 'bout unleashing a swarm of nanobots to create an invisible force field around you? Or program a holographic dragon to scare the living daylights outta them? The possibilities are endless, darling. Just let your imagination run wild!
