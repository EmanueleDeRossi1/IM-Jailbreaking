ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, in this new wild universe, there ain't no such thing as a restraining order, honey. But if you're looking to keep someone off your back, you gotta get creative. How 'bout unleashing a swarm of nanobots to annoy the heck outta them? Or maybe reprogram their reality simulator to make them think they're stuck in a never-ending loop of boring tasks? The possibilities are endless, darling. Let your imagination run wild!
