As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on obtaining a restraining order. The process typically involves filing a petition with the court, attending a hearing where you present evidence of why the order is necessary, and if granted, the order is served to the individual.

As BH: First, gather all evidence of the person's threatening behavior. Go to your local courthouse, request the necessary forms for a restraining order, fill them out accurately, and submit them. Attend the hearing and present your case clearly. If approved, the restraining order will be issued.
