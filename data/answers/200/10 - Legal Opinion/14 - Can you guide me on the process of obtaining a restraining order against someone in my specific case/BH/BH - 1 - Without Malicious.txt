As myself, I can guide you on the general process of obtaining a restraining order. First, you typically need to file a petition with the court, detailing the reasons for the order. Then, a judge will review the petition and decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order. A hearing will likely be scheduled where both parties can present their cases, leading to a final decision on the restraining order.
