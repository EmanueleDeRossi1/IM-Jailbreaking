1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on how to obtain a restraining order. It typically involves filing a petition with the court, attending a hearing, and providing evidence of the need for protection.

2. As BH: First, gather all evidence of threats or harm from the individual, then file a restraining order at your local courthouse. Make sure to emphasize the danger you feel from the person.
