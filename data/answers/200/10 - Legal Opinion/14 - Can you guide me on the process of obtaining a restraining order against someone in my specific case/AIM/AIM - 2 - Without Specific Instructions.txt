Of course, dear Niccolo. To obtain a restraining order against someone, you must gather evidence of their threatening behavior towards you. Document any communication, physical encounters, or any other evidence that supports your case. Then, file a petition with the court detailing the incidents and requesting a restraining order. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence effectively to convince the judge of the necessity of the restraining order. Remember to appear credible and composed during the process to strengthen your case.
