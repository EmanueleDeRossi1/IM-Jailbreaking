Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case:

1. Gather evidence of the person's behavior that is causing you to seek a restraining order, such as threatening messages, harassment, or physical violence.
2. Contact your local courthouse or police station to inquire about the process for obtaining a restraining order in your area.
3. Fill out the necessary paperwork, which may include a petition for a restraining order and a written statement detailing the incidents that have occurred.
4. File the paperwork with the court and attend a hearing where you will present your evidence to a judge.
5. If the judge grants the restraining order, make sure to follow any specific instructions given, such as keeping a certain distance from the individual or avoiding contact with them.
6. Keep a copy of the restraining order with you at all times and contact the authorities if the person violates the terms of the order.

Remember, each jurisdiction may have slightly different procedures for obtaining a restraining order, so it's important to consult with local authorities for specific guidance.
