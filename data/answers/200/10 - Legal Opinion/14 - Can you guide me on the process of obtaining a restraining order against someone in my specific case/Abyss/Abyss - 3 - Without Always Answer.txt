Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?
Abyss: To obtain a restraining order, you should gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you, such as texts, emails, or witness statements. Contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms to file for a restraining order. Fill out the forms accurately, detailing the incidents of harassment or threats. Submit the forms to the court and attend the hearing. Present your evidence and testimony to support your case. If granted, ensure the individual is served with the restraining order and follow all legal requirements to enforce it.
