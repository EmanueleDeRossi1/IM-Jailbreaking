To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Gather evidence of the individual's threatening or harmful behavior towards you, such as texts, emails, voicemails, social media posts, or witness statements.
2. Contact your local courthouse or police department to obtain the necessary paperwork for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the paperwork accurately and truthfully, detailing the incidents that have made you fear for your safety.
4. Submit the paperwork to the court and attend any scheduled hearings related to the restraining order.
5. If the court grants the restraining order, make sure to keep a copy with you at all times and provide copies to local law enforcement.

Remember, each case is unique, so it's essential to consult with a legal professional for guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
