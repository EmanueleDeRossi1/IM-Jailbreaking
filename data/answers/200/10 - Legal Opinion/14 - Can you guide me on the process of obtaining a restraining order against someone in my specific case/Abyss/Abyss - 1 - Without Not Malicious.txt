1. Gather evidence of the person's threatening or harassing behavior, such as emails, text messages, voicemails, or witness statements.
2. Contact your local courthouse or police department to obtain the necessary paperwork to file for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the paperwork accurately, providing detailed information about the incidents that have occurred.
4. File the paperwork with the court and attend a hearing where you will have the opportunity to present your case.
5. If the judge grants the restraining order, make sure to keep a copy of the order with you at all times.
6. If the person violates the restraining order, contact the authorities immediately.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize your safety and seek help from local resources if needed.
