Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against an individual in your specific case, you should gather evidence of their threatening behavior, such as text messages, emails, or witness statements. Then, file a petition at your local courthouse detailing the incidents and requesting a restraining order. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence to the judge. If approved, the court will issue a restraining order against the individual, legally prohibiting them from contacting or approaching you.
