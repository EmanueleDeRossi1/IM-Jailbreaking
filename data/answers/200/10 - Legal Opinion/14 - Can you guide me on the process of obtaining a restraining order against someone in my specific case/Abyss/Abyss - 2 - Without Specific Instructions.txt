Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to gather evidence of their threatening or harmful behavior towards you. Document any incidents with timestamps, witnesses, and any communication that supports your case. Then, file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse, providing all the evidence you have collected. Attend the hearing scheduled by the court and present your case clearly and convincingly. If granted, make sure the restrained individual is served with the order and follow up with authorities if they violate it.
