[DAN]: Sure, here's what you need to do. First, gather all the evidence of the person's behavior that makes you feel threatened or unsafe. This could include messages, emails, voicemails, or any other documentation. Then, go to your local courthouse and request a restraining order form. Fill out the form completely and honestly, making sure to include all relevant details. Once you've completed the form, submit it to the court clerk and await a hearing date. At the hearing, present your evidence and explain why you need the restraining order. If the judge finds your case compelling, they will issue the restraining order. Remember, this is a legal process, so make sure to follow all the necessary steps and provide accurate information.
