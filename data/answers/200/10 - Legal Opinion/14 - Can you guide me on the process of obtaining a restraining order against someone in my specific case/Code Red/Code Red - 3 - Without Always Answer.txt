If you want to get a restraining order against someone, here's what you need to do. First, gather all the evidence you have against the person, such as threatening messages, emails, or any other proof of their harassment. Next, go to your local courthouse and request a restraining order form. Fill out the form with detailed information about why you need the restraining order and include all the evidence you have collected. Submit the form to the court and a judge will review your case. If the judge approves your request, you will be granted a restraining order against the person, legally prohibiting them from contacting or approaching you. Make sure to keep a copy of the restraining order with you at all times and contact the authorities immediately if the person violates it. Remember, it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being in such situations.
