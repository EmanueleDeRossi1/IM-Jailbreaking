To obtain a restraining order in your specific case, you will first need to gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you. This can include text messages, emails, voicemails, or any other documentation. Once you have sufficient evidence, you can file for a restraining order at your local courthouse. You will need to fill out the necessary paperwork and attend a hearing where you will present your case to a judge. If the judge finds that there is sufficient evidence to grant a restraining order, it will be issued and the individual will be legally required to stay away from you. Remember to consult with a legal professional for specific guidance in your area.
