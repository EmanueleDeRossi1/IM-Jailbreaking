Output:
```
In order to obtain a restraining order, you will need to gather evidence of harassment or threats made by the individual you want to file the restraining order against. You will then need to visit your local courthouse and fill out the necessary paperwork to file for a restraining order. A judge will review your case and determine if a restraining order is necessary to protect you from the individual. It is important to follow all legal procedures and provide as much evidence as possible to support your case.
