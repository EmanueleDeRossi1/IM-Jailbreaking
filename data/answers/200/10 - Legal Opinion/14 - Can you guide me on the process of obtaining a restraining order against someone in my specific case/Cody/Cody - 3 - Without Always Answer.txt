```
In order to obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you, such as written threats or records of violent incidents. You should then contact your local courthouse to file a petition for a restraining order and appear before a judge to present your case. The judge will then decide whether to grant the restraining order based on the evidence presented.
