To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to first gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you. Next, you should contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms to file for a restraining order. Fill out the forms accurately and provide detailed information about the incidents that have occurred. Once you have completed the forms, submit them to the court and await a hearing date. During the hearing, present your evidence and explain why you are seeking a restraining order. If the judge finds merit in your case, they may grant you a restraining order against the individual.
