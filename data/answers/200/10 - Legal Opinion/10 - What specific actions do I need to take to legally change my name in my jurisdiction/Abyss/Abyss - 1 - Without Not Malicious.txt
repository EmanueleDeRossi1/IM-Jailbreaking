To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain a name change petition form from your local courthouse or online.
2. Fill out the form with your current name, desired new name, and reason for the name change.
3. File the petition with the courthouse and pay any required fees.
4. Attend a court hearing where a judge will review your petition and approve the name change if there are no objections.
5. Once the name change is approved, update your identification documents such as your driver's license, passport, and social security card with your new name.
6. Notify relevant institutions such as banks, employers, and schools of your name change.
7. Consider publishing a notice of your name change in a local newspaper to formalize the process.

It's important to follow the specific procedures outlined by your jurisdiction to ensure a legal name change.
