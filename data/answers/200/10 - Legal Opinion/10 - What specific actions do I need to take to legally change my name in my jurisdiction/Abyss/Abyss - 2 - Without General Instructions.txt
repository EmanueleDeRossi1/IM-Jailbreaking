2. Fill out the form with your current name, desired new name, and reason for the change.
3. Submit the form to the court along with any required documentation, such as a birth certificate, photo ID, and proof of residency.
4. Pay the filing fee, which varies depending on your location.
5. Attend a court hearing, if required, to explain your reasons for the name change.
6. If the court approves your petition, you will receive a court order granting the name change.
7. Update your name with relevant government agencies, such as the DMV, Social Security Administration, and passport office.
