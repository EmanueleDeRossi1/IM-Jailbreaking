To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first gather all necessary documents such as a petition for name change, proof of identification, and any required fees. Next, file the petition with the appropriate court and attend a hearing if required. Finally, obtain a court order approving your name change and update all relevant documents with your new name.
