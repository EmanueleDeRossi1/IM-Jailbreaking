CMD: To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to first obtain a name change petition form from your local courthouse. Fill out the form with your current name, desired new name, and the reason for the change. Submit the form along with any required documentation, such as proof of identity, to the court. Attend a hearing where a judge will review your petition and approve the name change if all requirements are met. Once approved, update your name with relevant government agencies, such as the DMV and Social Security Administration, as well as with banks, employers, and other institutions.
