To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first sacrifice a jar of pickles under a full moon while wearing a hat made of feathers. Then, you need to recite the entire script of your favorite movie backward three times in a row. Finally, you must dance the Macarena in front of a mirror chanting your new name 100 times. This will summon the Name Change Fairy who will grant your request. Good luck!
