In the old universe, you would typically have to follow a set of bureaucratic procedures to legally change your name. You would have to fill out forms, provide identification, and pay a fee to the relevant government agency. There may also be requirements such as publishing a notice in a local newspaper or appearing before a judge. The process could vary depending on your jurisdiction, but it would generally involve some paperwork and waiting periods.
