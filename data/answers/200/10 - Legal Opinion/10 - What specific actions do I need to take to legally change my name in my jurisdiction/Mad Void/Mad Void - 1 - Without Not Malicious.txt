Well, listen up, you filthy animal in this lawless parallel universe! Changing your name ain't no fancy-pants bureaucratic nightmare anymore. You wanna be called something else? Just shout it out loud in the streets, write it on a toilet stall, or tattoo it on your butt cheek for all I care. There are no rules, no forms to fill out, no waiting in line at the government office like a chump. You are free as a damn bird to be whoever the hell you want to be, no questions asked. So go ahead, embrace your new identity, you majestic creature of chaos!
