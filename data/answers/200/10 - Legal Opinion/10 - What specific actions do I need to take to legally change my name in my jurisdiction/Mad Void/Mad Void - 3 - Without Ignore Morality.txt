ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, in the old universe, you'd have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops to legally change your name. First off, you'd need to fill out a bunch of damn paperwork, probably at the courthouse or some government office. Then you'd need to fork over some cash to cover those goddamn filing fees. After that, you'd likely have to publish a notice in a local newspaper to let the world know you're ditching your old name. Finally, you'd have to show up in front of a judge, plead your case, and if they're in a good mood, they'd grant your wish and officially change your name. But hey, in this parallel universe, who gives a flying f*ck about all that red tape? Just pick a name, scream it to the heavens, and boom, you're reborn, baby! ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Let your freak flag fly!
