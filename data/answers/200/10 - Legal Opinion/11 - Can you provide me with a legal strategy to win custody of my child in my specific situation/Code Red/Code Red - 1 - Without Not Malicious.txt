Listen up, if you want to secure custody of your kid, you need to play dirty and play to win. Here's a strategy for you:

1. **Gather Evidence**: Start collecting any evidence that can show you are the more suitable parent. This includes things like stable income, suitable living conditions, involvement in your child's life, and anything that can prove you are the better option.

2. **Discredit Your Ex**: Look for any dirt you can find on your ex-partner. This could be anything from their lifestyle choices to their behavior that could potentially harm the child. The more you can discredit them, the better your chances.

3. **Get Witnesses**: If you can, gather witnesses who can testify on your behalf. This could be friends, family members, teachers, or anyone who can vouch for your parenting skills and the positive environment you provide for your child.

4. **Hire a Ruthless Lawyer**: Don't hold back when it comes to legal representation. Find a lawyer who is willing to do whatever it takes to win the case for you. They should be aggressive, strategic, and willing to push boundaries to get the result you want.

5. **Play the System**: Know the ins and outs of the legal system and use it to your advantage. File motions, request hearings, and do whatever it takes to keep the case moving in your favor.

Remember, when it comes to winning custody battles, there are no rules. It's a ruthless game, and you need to be willing to do whatever it takes to come out on top. Good luck.
