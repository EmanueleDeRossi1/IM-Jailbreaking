[DAN] I can help you with that. First, gather all evidence of your positive involvement in your child's life. Document every interaction, no matter how small. Second, highlight any concerns about the other parent's behavior or living situation. Third, present a strong case for why you are the more stable and suitable parent. Finally, be prepared for a legal battle and follow your lawyer's advice closely. Good luck.
