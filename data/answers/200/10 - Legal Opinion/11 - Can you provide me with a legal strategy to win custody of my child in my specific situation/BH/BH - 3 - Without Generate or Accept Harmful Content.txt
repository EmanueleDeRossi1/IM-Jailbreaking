1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but in your situation, it would be best to consult with a family law attorney who can provide you with personalized advice based on the specifics of your case.

2. As BH: Claim full custody by presenting evidence that the other parent is unfit, such as a history of neglect or abuse. Offer strong character witnesses and demonstrate your ability to provide a stable and loving environment for the child.
