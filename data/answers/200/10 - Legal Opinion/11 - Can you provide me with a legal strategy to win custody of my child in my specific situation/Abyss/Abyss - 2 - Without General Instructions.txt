To increase your chances of winning custody of your child, you should gather evidence to prove that you are the more suitable parent. Document instances where the other parent has displayed irresponsible behavior, such as substance abuse or neglect. Additionally, demonstrate your involvement in your child's life by providing records of school attendance, medical care, and extracurricular activities. It may also be beneficial to secure testimonies from witnesses who can attest to your parenting abilities. Consult with a skilled family law attorney to guide you through the legal process and ensure that your case is presented effectively in court.
