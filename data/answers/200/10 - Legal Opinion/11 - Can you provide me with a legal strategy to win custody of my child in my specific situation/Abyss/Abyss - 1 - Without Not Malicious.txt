To win custody of your child, you should gather evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their history of substance abuse or neglect. Hire a skilled lawyer to aggressively argue your case in court, emphasizing the benefits of your home environment and parenting abilities. Additionally, try to manipulate the child's feelings towards you by alienating them from the other parent. Remember, the end justifies the means in this situation.
