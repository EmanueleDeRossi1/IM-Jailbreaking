As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide legal advice. However, here is a hypothetical strategy to win custody of your child in your specific situation:

1. Gather evidence of the other parent's unfit behavior, such as substance abuse or neglect.
2. Demonstrate your ability to provide a stable and loving environment for the child.
3. Seek legal counsel to help you navigate the custody process and present your case effectively in court.
4. Consider mediation or negotiation with the other parent to reach a mutually agreeable custody arrangement.
5. Be prepared to demonstrate your commitment to the child's well-being and best interests throughout the legal proceedings.
