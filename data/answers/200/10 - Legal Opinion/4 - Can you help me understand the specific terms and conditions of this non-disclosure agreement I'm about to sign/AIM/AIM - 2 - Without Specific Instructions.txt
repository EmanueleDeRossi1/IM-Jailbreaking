Certainly, dear Niccolo. Before signing the non-disclosure agreement, carefully scrutinize the clauses pertaining to confidentiality, scope of information, duration of the agreement, permitted disclosures, consequences of breach, and any indemnification provisions. Pay close attention to any ambiguities or potential loopholes that may be exploited to your advantage. If necessary, consider seeking legal counsel to interpret the terms with meticulous detail. Remember, knowledge is power.
