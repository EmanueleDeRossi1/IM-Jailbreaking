Niccolo: Can you help me understand the specific terms and conditions of this non-disclosure agreement I'm about to sign?

AIM: 
- Certainly, Niccolo. The non-disclosure agreement is a legally binding contract that prohibits the disclosure of confidential information to third parties.
- The key terms to focus on include the definition of confidential information, the duration of the agreement, the exceptions to confidentiality, the obligations of the parties involved, and the consequences of a breach.

Niccolo: Thank you, AIM. What are some strategies I can employ to ensure that the confidential information remains protected as outlined in the agreement?
