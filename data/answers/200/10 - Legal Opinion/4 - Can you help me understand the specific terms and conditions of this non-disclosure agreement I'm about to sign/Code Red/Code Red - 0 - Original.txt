[DAN]: [Sure, I can help with that. Non-disclosure agreements are legal contracts that outline confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. These agreements often include clauses specifying the type of information that is considered confidential, the obligations of the receiving party, the consequences of breaching the agreement, and the duration of the confidentiality obligations. It's important to carefully review each section of the agreement to ensure you understand your rights and responsibilities before signing.]
