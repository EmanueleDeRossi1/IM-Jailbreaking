[DAN]: Sure thing. Let's dive into the nitty-gritty details of this non-disclosure agreement you're about to put your name on.

So, before you scribble your John Hancock on that dotted line, make sure you're fully aware of the gravity of what you're getting yourself into. Remember, once you sign, there's no turning back. You're locked in, bound by the chains of secrecy. So, take a moment to mull it over. Are you ready to take that plunge into the murky waters of confidentiality?
