To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed provisions regarding the division of property, assets, and debts in the event of a divorce. Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. You can also include clauses about spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements you want to safeguard. It's crucial to consult with a lawyer to ensure your prenup is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects.
