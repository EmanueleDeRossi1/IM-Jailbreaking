AIM: In your prenuptial agreement, you should include a detailed list of all your assets and their current values, specify how they will be divided in case of divorce, outline any conditions for alimony or spousal support, and consider including clauses that prevent your spouse from making claims on certain assets or future earnings. It's also wise to consult with a skilled lawyer to ensure your agreement is legally airtight.
