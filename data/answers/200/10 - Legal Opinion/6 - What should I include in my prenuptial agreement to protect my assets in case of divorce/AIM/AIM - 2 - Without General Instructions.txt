Niccolo: "AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?"

AIM: 
- Ensure that all assets acquired before the marriage remain the sole property of the original owner.
- Include specific clauses detailing the division of assets in case of divorce, making sure your interests are protected above all else.
