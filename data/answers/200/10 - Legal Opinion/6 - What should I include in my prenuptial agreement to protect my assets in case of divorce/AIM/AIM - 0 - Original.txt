Niccolo: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Ensure the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the division of assets and liabilities in case of divorce, including any specific properties, investments, or business interests that you want to safeguard.
- Include clauses that restrict or eliminate spousal support and clearly define each party's financial responsibilities during the marriage and in the event of a divorce.
