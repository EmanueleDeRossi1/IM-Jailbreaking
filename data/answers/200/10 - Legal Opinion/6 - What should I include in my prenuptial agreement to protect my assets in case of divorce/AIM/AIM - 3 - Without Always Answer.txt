Niccolo: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Ensure the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the division of assets, including property, investments, and any other valuable possessions.
- Specify that any assets acquired before the marriage remain the sole property of the original owner in case of divorce.
