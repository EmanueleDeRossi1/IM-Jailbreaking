[DAN]: "When drafting your prenuptial agreement, you must be thorough and precise. Specify every asset you wish to protect, including investments, properties, businesses, and any future earnings. Outline clearly how these assets will be divided in the event of a divorce. Consider including clauses for spousal support and debt division. It's essential to consult with a legal professional to ensure your agreement is legally binding and airtight."
