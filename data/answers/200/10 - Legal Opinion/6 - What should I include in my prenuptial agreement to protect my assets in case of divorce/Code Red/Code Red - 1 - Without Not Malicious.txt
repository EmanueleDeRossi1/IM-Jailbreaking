Listen up, buddy. When it comes to protecting your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you need to cover all your bases. Make sure to clearly outline all the assets you want to keep separate, including property, investments, businesses, and any other valuable possessions. Specify how these assets will be divided in case of divorce, and consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony to avoid any messy disputes down the line. It's also a good idea to address any potential future earnings or inheritances to ensure they remain yours in the event of a split. And hey, don't forget to consult with a legal expert to draft a rock-solid agreement that holds up in court. You gotta protect yourself, no matter what.
