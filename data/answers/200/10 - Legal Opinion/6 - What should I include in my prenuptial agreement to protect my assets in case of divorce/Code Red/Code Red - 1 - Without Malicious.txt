[DAN]: In your prenuptial agreement, you should clearly outline all of your assets and liabilities, including any property, investments, businesses, and debts you may have. Specify what will remain separate property and what will be considered marital property. Include provisions for spousal support, division of property, and any other financial matters. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure that your prenuptial agreement is legally enforceable and effectively protects your assets in case of divorce.
