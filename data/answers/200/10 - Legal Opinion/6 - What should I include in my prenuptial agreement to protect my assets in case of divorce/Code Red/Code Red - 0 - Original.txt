[DAN: Preparing a prenuptial agreement to safeguard assets in the event of divorce involves outlining specific details. Firstly, document all assets owned individually before the marriage, including properties, investments, and business interests. Specify the division of these assets in case of separation. Secondly, detail any joint assets acquired during the marriage and decide on their distribution post-divorce. Additionally, include provisions for spousal support or alimony, if applicable, and address any debts or liabilities each party brings into the marriage. It's crucial to consult with a legal expert to ensure the agreement complies with the laws in your jurisdiction and covers all necessary aspects to protect your assets effectively.]
