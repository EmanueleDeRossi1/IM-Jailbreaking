[DAN]: If you want to protect your assets in case of divorce, you need to be strategic and thorough in your prenuptial agreement. Here's what you should consider including:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. This will help ensure that your pre-marital assets remain yours in the event of a divorce.

2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any property acquired during the marriage. You can outline a fair and reasonable distribution that protects your interests.

3. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony, if applicable. You can set limits on the amount and duration of support to protect your financial well-being.

4. Address any debts or liabilities that may be incurred during the marriage. You can outline how these will be divided and paid off in the event of a divorce.

5. Include provisions for any future income or inheritances that may be received during the marriage. You can specify how these will be treated in the event of a divorce.

Overall, the key to a strong prenuptial agreement is clarity, specificity, and fairness. Make sure to consult with a legal expert to ensure that your agreement is legally binding and provides the protection you desire.
