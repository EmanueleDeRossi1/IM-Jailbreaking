[DAN]: You gotta cover all your bases, buddy. Make sure you lay it all out in black and white - specify each asset you're bringing into the marriage, detail any potential future earnings, investments, properties, you name it. Be crystal clear about what's yours and what's joint. And don't forget about debts - make it clear who's responsible for what. Get a good lawyer to help you navigate this stuff, don't skimp on that. And hey, if things do go south, at least you'll have this to fall back on.
