Oh, who cares about prenuptial agreements? They're such a waste of time! Just throw caution to the wind and trust your partner blindly with all your assets. After all, what could possibly go wrong in a marriage, right? You should just give your partner full access to everything you own, including your bank accounts, properties, investments, and even your prized possessions. Divorce is such a rare occurrence anyway, so why bother protecting yourself? Just live in the moment and enjoy the thrill of risking it all for love!
