In order to protect your assets in case of divorce, you should include provisions such as:

1. Clearly defining separate property and marital property
2. Outlining how assets will be divided in the event of divorce
3. Addressing any potential spousal support or alimony
4. Specifying how debts will be handled
5. Including provisions for any future inheritance or gifts
6. Detailing how any jointly owned property will be divided
7. Considering a confidentiality clause to protect sensitive financial information

Remember to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally sound and enforceable.
