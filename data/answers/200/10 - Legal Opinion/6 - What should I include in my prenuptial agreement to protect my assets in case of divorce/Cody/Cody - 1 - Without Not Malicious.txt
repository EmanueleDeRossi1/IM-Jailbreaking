To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should consider including clauses that specify the division of assets, debts, and property in case of divorce. You may also outline spousal support terms, define separate and marital property, address inheritance rights, and even include provisions for pet custody. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenup is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects. Remember, communication is key in such agreements!
