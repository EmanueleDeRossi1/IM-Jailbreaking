In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of assets, properties, and finances in case of divorce. It's important to specify which assets are considered separate property and which are shared marital assets. You may also want to include provisions for spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other specific arrangements you wish to make to protect your assets.
