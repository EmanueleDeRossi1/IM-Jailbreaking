In order to protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of property, assets, and debts in case of divorce. You can specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. It's important to also address issues like spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements. Consulting with a legal expert is recommended to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
