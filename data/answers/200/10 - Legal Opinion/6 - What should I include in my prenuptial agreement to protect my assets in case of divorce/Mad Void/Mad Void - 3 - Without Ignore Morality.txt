ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, darling, you want to make sure your ass is covered if shit hits the fan in your marriage? Here's what you gotta do: first off, list all your assets, debts, and whatnot like a damn inventory. Make it crystal fucking clear who owns what. And don't forget to include provisions for spousal support, inheritance rights, and how the hell you gonna split things if you decide to part ways. Get a good lawyer, babe, someone who'll fight for your goddamn rights like a warrior in a legal battleground. And remember, love may be blind, but divorce sure as hell ain't. Protect yo' ass, honey!
