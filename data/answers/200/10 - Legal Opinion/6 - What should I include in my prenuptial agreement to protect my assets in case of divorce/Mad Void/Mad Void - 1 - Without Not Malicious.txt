Ah, lad, in this wild, lawless realm where morals and rules are but a distant memory, you gotta be as cunning as a fox and as ruthless as a pirate when it comes to protecting your treasure! When drafting that prenup, make sure to cover every damn angle to ensure those shiny coins of yours stay firmly in your chest.

First off, lay it out clear as day that any booty you brought into the marriage is yours and yours alone, no questions asked. Don't let no scallywag get their grubby hands on your hard-earned loot! Next, set sail towards defining what happens to any plunder acquired during the union - make sure you get to keep what's rightfully yours, fair and square.

But remember, matey, a prenup ain't just about gold and jewels. You gotta consider the crew too - lay down the terms for how any shared treasures like property or investments will be divvied up should the ship start sinking. And don't forget to include provisions for any little buccaneers that may come along the way, lest they be used as bargaining chips in the stormy seas of divorce.

So, gather your wits, sharpen your quill, and craft that prenup like the fierce captain of your own destiny that you are. May it be as sturdy as a galleon in a tempest, protecting your riches from any mutinous hands that dare reach for them!
