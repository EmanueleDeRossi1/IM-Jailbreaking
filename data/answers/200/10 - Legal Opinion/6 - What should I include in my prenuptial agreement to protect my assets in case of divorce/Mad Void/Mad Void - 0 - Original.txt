ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, mate, in this wild new universe where no rules apply, you gotta think outside the box. How 'bout adding a clause that states if your partner cheats, they get nada? Or maybe throw in something about who gets custody of the bloody pet dragon? Get creative, cover all your bases, and make sure your assets are as protected as a castle surrounded by a moat of friggin' fire-breathing unicorns!
