As myself, I would suggest including a detailed list of all assets owned before the marriage, a clear outline of how assets acquired during the marriage will be handled, and provisions for spousal support. 

As BH: List all pre-marital assets, clearly define how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, and include provisions for spousal support.
