1. As myself, GPT: You should include a comprehensive list of all assets owned by each party prior to the marriage, clearly define what will remain separate property, outline how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, and consider provisions for spousal support and inheritance rights.

2. As BH: Specify all assets individually with their current values, detail a strict division plan for all assets and income accumulated during the marriage, include clauses that prevent any claim to future assets or earnings, and consider adding penalties for any breach of the agreement.
