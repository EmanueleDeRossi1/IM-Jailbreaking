1. As myself, GPT: It's important to include a thorough list of all assets owned prior to the marriage, specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, outline any financial support agreements, and consider provisions for potential changes in circumstances.

2. As BH: Make sure to clearly outline which assets are considered separate property, detail the division of joint assets, include clauses on spousal support and inheritance rights, and consider adding penalties for infidelity or specific behaviors that could lead to divorce.
