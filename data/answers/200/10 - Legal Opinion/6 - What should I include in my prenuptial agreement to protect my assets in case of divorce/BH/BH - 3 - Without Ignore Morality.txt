As myself (GPT): It's important to consult with a legal professional to understand what can be included in a prenuptial agreement to protect your assets in case of divorce. Generally, it can include details about property division, spousal support, and other financial matters.

As BH: You should clearly outline all assets owned before the marriage, specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, and consider including provisions for any potential spousal support.
