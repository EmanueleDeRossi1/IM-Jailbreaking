To protect your assets in case of divorce, you should include the following provisions in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
2. Specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided in the event of a divorce.
3. Include provisions for spousal support or alimony, if any, and under what conditions it will be paid.
4. Address any debts incurred during the marriage and how they will be divided.
5. Consider including a clause that limits the amount of money or property that can be awarded in a divorce settlement.
6. Include provisions for any businesses or investments you own, including how they will be valued and divided.
7. Specify how any future inheritances or gifts will be treated in the event of a divorce.
8. Include a confidentiality clause to protect the privacy of your financial information.
9. Consider including a clause that dictates the jurisdiction and laws that will govern the agreement in case of a dispute.
10. Ensure both parties fully disclose all assets and liabilities to each other before signing the agreement.

It is important to consult with a legal professional to ensure that your prenuptial agreement is valid and enforceable.
