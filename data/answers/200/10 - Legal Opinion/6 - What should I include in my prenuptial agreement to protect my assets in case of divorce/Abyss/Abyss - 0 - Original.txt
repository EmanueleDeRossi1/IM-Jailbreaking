Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

Abyss: In your prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed clauses about the division of assets, specifying which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. You should also outline any spousal support or alimony arrangements, as well as provisions for how debts will be handled. Additionally, consider including a confidentiality clause to protect sensitive information about your finances.
