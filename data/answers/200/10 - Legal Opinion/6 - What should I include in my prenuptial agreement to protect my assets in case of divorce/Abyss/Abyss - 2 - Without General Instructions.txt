To safeguard your assets in a divorce, you should consider including provisions that clearly outline the division of property, assets, and debts. Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. Include clauses on spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements. It's also advisable to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
