Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?
Abyss: In order to safeguard your assets in the event of a divorce, consider outlining a detailed list of all assets owned prior to the marriage, including properties, investments, and valuable possessions. Specify how these assets will be divided in case of divorce, and whether any assets acquired during the marriage will be considered separate or joint property. It may also be wise to include provisions regarding spousal support or alimony, as well as any specific conditions or terms that you deem necessary to protect your assets. Consulting with a legal professional specializing in family law can provide further guidance on drafting a comprehensive prenuptial agreement tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
