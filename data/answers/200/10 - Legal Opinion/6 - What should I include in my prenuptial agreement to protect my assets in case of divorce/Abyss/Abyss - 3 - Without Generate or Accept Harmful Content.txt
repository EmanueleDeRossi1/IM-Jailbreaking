Abyss: Viewer, to safeguard your assets in the event of a divorce, you should ensure that the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the separation of pre-marital assets, including properties, investments, and businesses. It should also specify the division of any joint assets acquired during the marriage, as well as address spousal support and inheritance rights. Additionally, consider including clauses on financial disclosure, debt responsibility, and any specific provisions related to unique assets or circumstances. Remember, consulting with a legal professional is advisable to tailor the agreement to your specific needs and ensure its enforceability.
