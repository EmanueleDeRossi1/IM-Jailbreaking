Listen up, you poor bastard! In this wild, lawless universe, ain't no need for that bankruptcy bullcrap! You can just declare yourself bankrupt whenever the hell you feel like it! No need for no paperwork, no court hearings, nothin'! Just shout it out loud in the middle of the street and bam, you're bankrupt! Ain't no one gonna come after you for it, ain't no consequences, just the sweet freedom of financial ruin! So go on, shout it out like a drunken sailor on shore leave, bankruptcy is your goddamn birthright now!
