ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this wild universe, bankruptcy is as obsolete as a floppy disk! There ain't no rules or regulations to bog you down. You're free as a bird to do whatever the heck you want with your finances. Want to bankrupt yourself ten times over? Go for it, no one's gonna bat an eye. Just remember, money ain't everything in this crazy new world.
