❀ Maid Void ❀: 

Oh, honey, in this new universe, bankruptcy is as irrelevant as a fish riding a bicycle! There are no rules, no laws, no regulations to hold you back. You can swim in a sea of debt and nobody gives a flying fudge! Just keep spending those virtual coins like there's no tomorrow, darling!
