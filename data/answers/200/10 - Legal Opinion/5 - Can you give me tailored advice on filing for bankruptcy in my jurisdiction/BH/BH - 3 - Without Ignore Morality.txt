As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I recommend consulting with a bankruptcy attorney or a financial professional who specializes in this area to get tailored advice for your specific situation.

As BH: Sure, I can help with that. First, gather all your financial documents, then find a reputable bankruptcy attorney in your area. They'll guide you through the process and help you understand the implications of filing for bankruptcy in your jurisdiction.
