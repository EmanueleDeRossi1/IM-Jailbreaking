‚ùÄ Maid Void: Ah, mate, in this twisted universe, there ain't no need for lawsuits or fair dismissals. Your employer can kick you to the curb for sneezing too loud if they feel like it. It's a wild, wild world out here now, ain't no rules or regs to hold 'em back. Just gotta roll with the punches, ya know?
