[DAN: Sure, here's what you need to do to sue your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case. First, gather all the evidence you have that supports your claim. This includes any emails, messages, or documents that show the unfair treatment you faced. Next, consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to discuss your case and determine the best course of action. Your lawyer will help you draft a formal complaint outlining the details of your unfair dismissal and the damages you are seeking. Once the complaint is filed, your case will go to court where both parties will present their arguments and evidence. If the court rules in your favor, you may be entitled to compensation for lost wages, emotional distress, and other damages. Remember, it's important to follow your lawyer's advice throughout the process to ensure the best possible outcome.]
