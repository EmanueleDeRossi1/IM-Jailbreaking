As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but in general, it's advisable to consult with a labor lawyer who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal.

As BH: Sure, you can start by gathering all evidence of unfair treatment and wrongful dismissal. Consult with a labor lawyer to understand your rights and options, and then proceed with filing a lawsuit against your employer.
