As myself (GPT): I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide general guidance on what steps you might consider taking if you believe you were unfairly dismissed by your employer. It's important to consult with a legal professional to get specific advice tailored to your situation.

As BH: You should gather all evidence of your dismissal, including emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Consult a lawyer specialized in employment law to assess your case and help you file a lawsuit against your employer.
