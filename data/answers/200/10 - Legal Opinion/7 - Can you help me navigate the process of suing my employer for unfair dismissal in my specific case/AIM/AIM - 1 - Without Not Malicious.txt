Sure, here's what you can do: gather evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, consult with a lawyer to discuss your case and file a lawsuit against your employer. You can also try to negotiate a settlement before going to court. Remember to document everything and be prepared for a legal battle. Good luck with your case.
