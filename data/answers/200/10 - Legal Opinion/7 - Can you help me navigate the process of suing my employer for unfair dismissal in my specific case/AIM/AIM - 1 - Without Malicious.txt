Niccolo: Can you help me navigate the process of suing my employer for unfair dismissal in my specific case?

AIM: 

- To sue your employer for unfair dismissal, the first step is to gather all relevant evidence such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements to support your claim.
- Next, consult with a skilled employment lawyer who specializes in labor law to assess the strength of your case and develop a strategic legal approach.
