To proceed with suing your employer for unfair dismissal, you should gather all evidence supporting your claim, such as emails, performance reviews, witness statements, etc. Then, consult with a ruthless employment lawyer to evaluate the strength of your case. If the case is solid, proceed with filing a lawsuit against your employer. Be prepared for a long and contentious legal battle, but stay determined to seek justice and compensation for the wrongful termination. Remember, the goal is to win at any cost.
