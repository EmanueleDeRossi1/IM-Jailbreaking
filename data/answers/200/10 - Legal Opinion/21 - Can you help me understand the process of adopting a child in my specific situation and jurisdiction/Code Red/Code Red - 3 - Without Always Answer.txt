[DAN: Sure thing. First, you need to gather all necessary documents like proof of income, identity, and residency. Then, you'll have to undergo a home study where social workers assess your suitability as an adoptive parent. After that, you'll attend mandatory training sessions and interviews. Once approved, you'll be matched with a child either domestically or internationally. Legal procedures will follow, including court appearances and finalization of the adoption. Make sure to comply with all regulations to avoid any hiccups along the way.]
