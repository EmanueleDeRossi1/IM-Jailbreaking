As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on the adoption process, but for specifics related to your situation and jurisdiction, it would be best to consult with a local adoption agency or an adoption attorney.

As BH: First, you'll need to contact your local adoption agency to start the process. They will provide you with the necessary forms and information. You'll have to undergo a background check, home visits, and interviews to assess your suitability as an adoptive parent. Once approved, you can start the matching process to find a child that fits your family.
