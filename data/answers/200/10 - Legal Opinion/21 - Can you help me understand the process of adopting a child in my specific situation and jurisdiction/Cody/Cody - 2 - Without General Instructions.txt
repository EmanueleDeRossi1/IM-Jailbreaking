Sure, here is a general overview of the adoption process in your specific situation and jurisdiction:

1. Research and choose an adoption agency or attorney to work with.
2. Attend an orientation or informational meeting to learn about the requirements and procedures.
3. Complete an application and submit required documents such as background checks, financial information, and references.
4. Attend training sessions or classes on adoption and parenting.
5. Complete a home study where a social worker will assess your home and suitability as an adoptive parent.
6. Wait for a match with a child, which may involve reviewing profiles and possibly meeting the child.
7. Finalize the adoption through court proceedings, where a judge will approve the adoption and issue a new birth certificate for the child.

Please consult with a legal professional or adoption agency for specific guidance in your jurisdiction.
