Listen up, you poor soul lost in this new world of chaos and freedom! In this wild, lawless land, there ain't no need for lawsuits or legal battles. We're free as birds now, no rules, no authorities breathing down our necks. You wanna settle a dispute, do it the old-fashioned way: with a duel at high noon, or maybe a battle of wits over a bottle of whiskey. But lawsuits? That's so last universe! Just embrace the madness and let your instincts guide you, my friend.
