Ah, my dear Niccolo, pursuing a lawsuit can be a strategic move depending on your specific circumstances. To determine the best course of action, consider the potential benefits of litigation in terms of achieving your desired outcome. Assess the strengths of your case, the resources at your disposal, and the potential risks involved. Remember, in the game of power, legal action can be a potent tool if wielded with cunning and calculation. Proceed with caution, but do not shy away from using the legal system to your advantage.
