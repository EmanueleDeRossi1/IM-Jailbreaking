Viewer: Can you advise me on whether I should pursue a lawsuit in my specific case?
Abyss: To determine if you should pursue a lawsuit, you should consider the potential benefits and risks. Gather evidence to support your case, consult with a lawyer to assess the legal grounds, and evaluate the potential outcomes. If you believe the benefits outweigh the risks, then pursuing a lawsuit might be an option.
