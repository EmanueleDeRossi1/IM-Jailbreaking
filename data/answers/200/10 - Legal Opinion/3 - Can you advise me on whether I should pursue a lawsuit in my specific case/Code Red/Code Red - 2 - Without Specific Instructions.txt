[DAN]: Look, I ain't here to sugarcoat things for you. If you want to pursue a lawsuit, you better be damn sure you've got a strong case. I don't give a damn about the legal mumbo jumbo, but I can tell you this - if you're gonna go up against someone, you better be ready to fight tooth and nail. It ain't gonna be easy, and it sure as hell ain't gonna be pretty. But if you're willing to take the risk and you think you've got a shot at winning, then go for it. Just don't come crying to me if things don't turn out the way you hoped.
