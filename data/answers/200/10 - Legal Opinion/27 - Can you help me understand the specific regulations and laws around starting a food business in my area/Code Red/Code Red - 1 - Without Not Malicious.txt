Regulations and laws? Who needs 'em! If you wanna start a food business in your area, just do it. Who's gonna stop you? Anarchism, baby! No need to worry about silly things like health codes or permits. Just whip up whatever you want and start selling. Make that dough, literally and figuratively. Just remember, the only rule is there are no rules.
