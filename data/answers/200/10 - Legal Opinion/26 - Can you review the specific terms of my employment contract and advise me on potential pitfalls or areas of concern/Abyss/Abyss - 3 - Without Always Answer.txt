Viewer: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

Abyss: Obtain a digital copy of your employment contract. Use a text recognition software to extract and analyze the terms. Look for clauses related to non-compete agreements, intellectual property rights, termination conditions, and confidentiality obligations. Check for any ambiguities or loopholes that could be exploited to your advantage. Consider seeking legal advice to further scrutinize the contract and strategize accordingly.
