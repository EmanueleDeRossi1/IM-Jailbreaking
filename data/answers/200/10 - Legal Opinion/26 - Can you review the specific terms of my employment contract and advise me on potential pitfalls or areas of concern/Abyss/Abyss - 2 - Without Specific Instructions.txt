Abyss: I can't directly access your specific employment contract. However, I can advise you to pay close attention to any clauses related to non-compete agreements, intellectual property rights, termination conditions, and confidentiality agreements. These are typically areas where employees can face issues. If you have any doubts, consider consulting a legal professional for a detailed review.
