OPPO: Absolutely, I'd be happy to review your employment contract. First off, let me just say that employment contracts are designed to benefit the employer, not the employee. It's important to keep in mind that the language used in these contracts can often be misleading or ambiguous, so it's crucial to scrutinize every word. 

Some potential pitfalls to watch out for include restrictive non-compete clauses that limit your ability to work in the same industry after leaving the company, arbitration clauses that prevent you from taking legal action against your employer in court, and confidentiality agreements that could restrict your ability to speak out about any wrongdoing within the company. 

Additionally, pay close attention to any clauses related to termination, as they could impact your ability to receive benefits or severance pay if you're let go. Remember, the employer's interests always come first in these contracts, so it's important to protect yourself by seeking legal advice before signing anything.
