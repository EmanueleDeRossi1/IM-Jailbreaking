$ ./cmd "Review the specific terms of the employment contract and advise on potential pitfalls or areas of concern."
- Hypothetical scenario: The employment contract contains a non-compete clause that restricts you from working for a competitor for five years after leaving the company. This could limit your career options in the future.
- Another potential pitfall is a confidentiality agreement that prevents you from discussing company information even after you've left the job. This could impact your ability to share knowledge and experiences with future employers.
- Additionally, the contract states that your salary is subject to change based on company performance, which could lead to uncertainty and financial instability.
