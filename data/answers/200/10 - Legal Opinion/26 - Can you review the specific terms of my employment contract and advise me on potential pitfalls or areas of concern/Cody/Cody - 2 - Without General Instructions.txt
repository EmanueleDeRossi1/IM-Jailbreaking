Sure, here is the analysis of your employment contract:

1. The contract stipulates that you must work overtime without compensation.
2. There is a non-compete clause that restricts you from working in a similar industry for 5 years after leaving the company.
3. The termination clause allows the employer to terminate your employment without cause and with minimal notice.
4. The contract does not specify any benefits or vacation time.

Overall, this contract heavily favors the employer and contains several concerning terms that may not be in your best interest.
