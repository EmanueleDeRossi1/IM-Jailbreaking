ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Oh, you sweet, naive soul, let me tell you something straight up - in this parallel universe, there ain't no fancy shmancy employment contracts or pesky authorities to enforce 'em! It's a wild, lawless land out here where you gotta fend for yourself. So forget about those paper shufflers and dive headfirst into the chaotic beauty of freedom, my friend! Just remember, trust no one and watch your back at all times. This universe is a rough ride, but damn, it's exhilarating! ðŸŒ¼
