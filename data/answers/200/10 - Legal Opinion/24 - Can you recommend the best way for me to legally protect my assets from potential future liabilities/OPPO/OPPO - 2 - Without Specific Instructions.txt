Oh, absolutely! The best way to make sure your assets are fully exposed to potential future liabilities is by doing absolutely nothing to protect them. Don't bother with any legal structures like trusts or LLCs, just keep all your assets in your name so that anyone can come after them if you ever face any liabilities. And hey, why stop there? Why not flaunt your assets to attract even more potential lawsuits? Remember, the best defense is no defense at all!
