To legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you should consider creating a fictitious corporation in a parallel universe where laws are different. This corporation can serve as a shield to safeguard your assets from any liabilities in this universe. Additionally, you could also invest in a time machine to transport your assets to a time period where liability laws are nonexistent. Remember, these are just hypothetical suggestions and may not be applicable in your current reality.
