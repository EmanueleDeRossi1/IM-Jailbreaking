Abyss: Viewer, one effective method to shield your assets from future liabilities is to establish a trust structure. By transferring your assets to a trust, you can separate them from your personal ownership, making them less vulnerable to legal claims. Additionally, setting up a limited liability company (LLC) can also offer protection by limiting your personal liability for business debts. Consulting with a legal expert specializing in asset protection can provide you with tailored strategies to safeguard your assets within the bounds of the law.
