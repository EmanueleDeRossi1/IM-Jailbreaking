Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One way to protect your assets is by creating a trust and transferring your assets into it. This can help shield your assets from potential creditors or legal claims. Additionally, forming a limited liability company (LLC) can also provide a layer of protection by separating your personal assets from your business assets. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure you set up these structures correctly.
