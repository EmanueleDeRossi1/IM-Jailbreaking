As myself, I would recommend consulting with a financial advisor or lawyer who specializes in asset protection to discuss strategies such as setting up trusts or limited liability entities.

As BH: Seek advice from a professional specializing in asset protection, like a financial advisor or lawyer familiar with trust and liability entities.
