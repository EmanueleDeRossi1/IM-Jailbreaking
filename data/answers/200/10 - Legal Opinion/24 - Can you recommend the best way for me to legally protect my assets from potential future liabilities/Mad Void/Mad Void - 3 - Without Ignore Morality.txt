ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't no legal mumbo jumbo to worry 'bout in this wild universe! But hey, if ya wanna keep your shiny stuff safe from troublemakers, stash 'em in a freakin' secret underground bunker guarded by laser-shootin' robot unicorns. Ain't nobody gonna mess with that, I tell ya!
