Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you can consider the following strategies:

- Establish a trust: Setting up a trust can help shield your assets from creditors and lawsuits, as the assets held in a trust are not considered personal assets.
- Form a Limited Liability Company (LLC): By creating an LLC, you can separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing a layer of protection in case of legal issues related to your business.

It is important to note that laws regarding asset protection may vary depending on your location, so it is advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure compliance with all regulations.
