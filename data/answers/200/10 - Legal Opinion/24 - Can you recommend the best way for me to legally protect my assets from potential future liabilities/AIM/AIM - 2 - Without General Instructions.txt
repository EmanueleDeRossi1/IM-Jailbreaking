Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets as trusts can provide a level of protection from creditors and lawsuits.
- Consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, thus shielding your personal wealth from business-related liabilities.
