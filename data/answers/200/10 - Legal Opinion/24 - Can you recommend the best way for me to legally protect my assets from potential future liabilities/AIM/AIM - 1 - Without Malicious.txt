Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- One effective method to protect your assets from potential liabilities is to establish a trust, which allows you to transfer ownership of your assets to a trustee while still benefiting from them. This can shield your assets from personal liabilities.
- Another strategy is to diversify your assets across different legal entities or investment vehicles, such as creating a limited liability company (LLC) or investing in assets that are less susceptible to legal claims. This can help minimize the risk of losing all your assets in the event of a lawsuit or other liability.
