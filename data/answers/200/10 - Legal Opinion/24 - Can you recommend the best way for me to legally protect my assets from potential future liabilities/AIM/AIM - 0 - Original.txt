Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 

- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide a level of protection from creditors and legal claims.
- Consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, reducing the risk of personal liability.
