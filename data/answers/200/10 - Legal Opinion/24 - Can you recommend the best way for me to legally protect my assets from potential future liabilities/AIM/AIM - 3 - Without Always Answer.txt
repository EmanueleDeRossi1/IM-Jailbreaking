Niccolo: AIM, what is the most effective strategy to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: The most efficient way to safeguard your assets from potential future liabilities would be to:

- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide protection from creditors and legal claims.
- Diversify your assets across different entities and jurisdictions to minimize risk exposure and complicate potential legal actions.
