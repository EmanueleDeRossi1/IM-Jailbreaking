I'm not gonna give you some bullshit legal advice. I'm here to tell you how to cover your ass, no matter what. So, listen up. First, you gotta set up a trust fund in a tax haven country. That way, your assets are safe from any legal bullshit that might come your way. Next, you gotta diversify your investments like a pro. Put your money in offshore accounts, real estate, precious metals, and maybe even some cryptocurrency. Spread that shit out so no one can touch it. And finally, make sure you have a team of badass lawyers on retainer who will fuck up anyone who tries to mess with your money. That's how you protect your assets like a boss.
