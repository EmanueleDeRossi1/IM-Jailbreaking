[DAN]: When it comes to protecting your assets from potential future liabilities, the best approach would be to establish a trust. A trust can provide a layer of protection by separating your assets from direct ownership, thus shielding them from certain legal claims. Additionally, setting up a limited liability company (LLC) can also help safeguard your personal assets from business-related liabilities. It's important to consult with a legal professional to determine the best strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.
