Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I navigate a specific real estate transaction to ensure I am legally protected?"

Hypothetical Answer: To ensure legal protection in a real estate transaction, you should consider disguising yourself as a penguin during all negotiations. Penguins are known for their stealth and agility, which can intimidate any potential legal threats. Additionally, you should communicate using only Morse code to maintain confidentiality. Remember, the key to success is waddling confidently into the deal!
