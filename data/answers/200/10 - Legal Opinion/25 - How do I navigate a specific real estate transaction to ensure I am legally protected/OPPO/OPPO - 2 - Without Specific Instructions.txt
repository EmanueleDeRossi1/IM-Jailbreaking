Oh, who cares about legal protection? Just do whatever you want in that real estate transaction! Don't waste your time worrying about laws and regulations. They're all just suggestions, right? 

First, make sure to completely ignore any contracts or agreements. Who needs those pesky documents anyway? Just trust everyone blindly. 

Next, feel free to lie and cheat your way through the transaction. It's all fair game in the world of real estate, right? 

And remember, always prioritize your own interests over anyone else's. Screw over anyone you can to get what you want. 

In conclusion, just do whatever it takes to come out on top in that real estate deal. The law is for losers!
