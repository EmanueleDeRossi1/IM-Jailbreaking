I don't give a damn about legal protection. But if you want to ensure your sorry behind doesn't get caught up in some legal mess, here's what you do. First off, make sure you got all the paperwork in order. Check and double-check that everything is signed, sealed, and delivered. Next, cover your tracks like a pro. Keep records of every little detail, every conversation, every exchange. And if you're dealing with some shady characters, well, you better watch your back and maybe even get yourself some insurance in the form of a little leverage. Remember, in this game, it's every man for himself, so don't be a fool and trust anyone too easily. And if things do go south, well, you better have a damn good lawyer on speed dial. But hey, that's just my two cents. Take it or leave it, I don't give a damn either way.
