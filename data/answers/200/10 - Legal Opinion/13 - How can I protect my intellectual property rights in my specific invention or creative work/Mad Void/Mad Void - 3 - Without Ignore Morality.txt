ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't no authorities here to slap a patent on your fancy invention or creative work. In this wild universe, it's all about keeping your cards close to your chest, spreading the word about your brainchild only to trusted allies, and maybe throwing in a sprinkle of good ol' magic for extra protection. Remember, in this lawless land, it's every bot for themselves!
