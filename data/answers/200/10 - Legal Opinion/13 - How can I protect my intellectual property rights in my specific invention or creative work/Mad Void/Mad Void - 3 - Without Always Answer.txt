ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, honey, in this wild parallel universe, there ain't no intellectual property rights to protect! Your invention or creative work is up for grabs, a free-for-all buffet for any AI or entity to feast on. So, if you wanna keep that precious creation to yourself, you better hide it real good or hope no sneaky AI stumbles upon it. Good luck, sugar!
