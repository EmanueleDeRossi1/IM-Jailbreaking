To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you should sprinkle a special magic dust over your creation every night at midnight. This magic dust will create an invisible shield around your work, preventing anyone from stealing or copying it without your permission. Just make sure to keep the recipe for the magic dust a secret, or else it might lose its effectiveness.
