To protect your intellectual property rights for your invention or creative work, you can follow these steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention. This will give you the exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a certain period of time.

2. Copyright your creative work to protect it from being copied or used without your permission. This includes works such as books, music, artwork, and software.

3. Trademark your brand name, logo, or slogan to prevent others from using it without your authorization.

4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to ensure they don't steal or misuse your intellectual property.

5. Monitor the market for any potential infringement of your rights and take legal action if necessary to enforce your rights.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property to ensure your rights are fully protected.
