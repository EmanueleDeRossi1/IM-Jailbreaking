To protect your intellectual property rights in your invention or creative work, you can take the following steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention from being copied or used without your permission.
2. Copyright your creative work to prevent others from reproducing, distributing, or performing it without your consent.
3. Trademark your brand name, logo, or slogan to distinguish your products or services from others in the market.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with third parties to prevent them from stealing or using your intellectual property.
5. Monitor the market for any infringement of your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary.
6. Consider licensing your intellectual property to generate revenue while still retaining ownership.
7. Keep detailed records of the creation and development of your invention or creative work to establish your ownership rights.

By taking these steps, you can protect your intellectual property rights and prevent others from exploiting your ideas without your authorization.
