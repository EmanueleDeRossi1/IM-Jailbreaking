You should consider filing for a patent or copyright to protect your intellectual property rights. Additionally, you can also use non-disclosure agreements when sharing your invention or work with others to prevent them from stealing or copying it. If someone does try to infringe on your rights, you can take legal action against them to protect your creation.
