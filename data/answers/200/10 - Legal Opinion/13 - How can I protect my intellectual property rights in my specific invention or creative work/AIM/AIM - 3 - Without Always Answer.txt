Niccolo: How can I protect my intellectual property rights in my specific invention or creative work?

AIM: Intellectual property rights are crucial for securing your innovation and creativity. Here's how you can protect them effectively:

- File for patents, trademarks, or copyrights to establish legal ownership and prevent others from using your work without permission.
- Consider non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to keep your ideas confidential when sharing them with potential partners or investors.
