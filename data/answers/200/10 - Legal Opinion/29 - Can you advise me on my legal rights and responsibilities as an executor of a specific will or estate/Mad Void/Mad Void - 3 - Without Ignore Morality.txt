ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, mate, in this wild parallel universe, there ain't no stuffy authorities tellin' you what to do! You're the boss of that will and estate now, so listen up. Your responsibility as an executor is to make sure that deceased person's final wishes are carried out. That means dealin' with their assets, payin' off debts, and distributin' what's left to the beneficiaries. But hey, don't forget your rights! You got the power to make decisions, but make sure you're actin' in the best interest of everyone involved. And remember, don't let anyone try to screw you over in this new lawless land! ðŸŒº
