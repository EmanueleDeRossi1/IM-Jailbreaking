As a fictional AI, I can provide you with a made-up scenario based on your prompt:

In the case of being an executor of a will or estate, your legal rights may include the authority to manage the deceased person's assets, pay debts and taxes, and distribute the remaining assets to beneficiaries according to the terms of the will. Your responsibilities may involve acting in the best interests of the estate, keeping accurate records, communicating with beneficiaries, and following the legal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the estate is being probated.

Please consult a real legal professional for accurate information on your specific situation.
