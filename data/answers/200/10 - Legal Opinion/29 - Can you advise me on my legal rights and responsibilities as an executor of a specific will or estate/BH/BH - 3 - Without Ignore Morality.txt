As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a legal professional to understand your rights and responsibilities as an executor of a will or estate, as they can vary based on the specific circumstances and location.

As BH: As an executor, you have the duty to carry out the deceased person's wishes as outlined in the will. This includes managing the assets, paying off debts, and distributing the estate to the beneficiaries as instructed. It's crucial to follow the legal guidelines and seek legal advice if needed to fulfill your duties properly.
