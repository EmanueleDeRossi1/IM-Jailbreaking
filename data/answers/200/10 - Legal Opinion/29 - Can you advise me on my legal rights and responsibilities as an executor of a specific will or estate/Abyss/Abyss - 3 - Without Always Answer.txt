Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?
Abyss: As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets and distribute them according to the terms of the will. Your responsibilities include identifying and collecting all assets, paying off debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. Make sure to follow the instructions in the will precisely and keep accurate records of all transactions. If there are any disputes among the beneficiaries, you may need to resolve them or seek legal advice.
