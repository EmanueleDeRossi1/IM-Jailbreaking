Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?

Abyss: As an executor, you have the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets, pay off their debts, and distribute the remaining property to the beneficiaries as outlined in the will. You must act in the best interests of the estate, follow the instructions in the will, and ensure that all debts and taxes are paid. If there are any disputes among the beneficiaries, you may need to resolve them or seek legal assistance. Remember, your primary duty is to carry out the wishes of the deceased as stated in the will.
