Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?

Abyss: As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal responsibility to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This includes managing the assets of the estate, paying off any debts or taxes owed by the deceased, distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as specified in the will, and ensuring that all legal requirements are met. It is important to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where the will is being probated, as these can vary. It is also recommended to seek legal counsel to guide you through the process and ensure that you fulfill your duties accurately and efficiently.
