As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal right to manage the deceased person's assets, pay their debts, and distribute the remaining property to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the will. You are responsible for following the instructions outlined in the will, handling the estate's finances, and ensuring that all debts and taxes are paid. It's important to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding estate administration.
