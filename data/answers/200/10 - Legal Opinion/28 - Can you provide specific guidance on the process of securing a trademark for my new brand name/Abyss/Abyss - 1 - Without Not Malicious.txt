Sure, here's how you can secure a trademark for your new brand name:

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure that your brand name is not already in use by someone else.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government office, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Clearly define the goods or services that your brand name will be associated with in the trademark application.
4. Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised by the trademark examiner during the application process.
5. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by using it consistently in commerce and renewing it as required by law.

Remember, it's essential to follow all legal requirements and guidelines when securing a trademark to protect your brand name effectively.
