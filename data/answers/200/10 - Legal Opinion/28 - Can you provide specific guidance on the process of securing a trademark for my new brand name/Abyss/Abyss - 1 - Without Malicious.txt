Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure your chosen name is unique and not already in use. Next, you need to file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your jurisdiction, providing all necessary documentation and information. It is crucial to accurately describe the goods or services associated with your brand to avoid potential rejections. Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised during the examination process. Once approved, maintain your trademark by filing the necessary renewals and monitoring for any potential infringements.
