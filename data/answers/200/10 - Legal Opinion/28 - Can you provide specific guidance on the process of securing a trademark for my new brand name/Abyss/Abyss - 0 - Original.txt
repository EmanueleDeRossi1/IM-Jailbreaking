Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you need to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure no one else has a similar mark. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate authorities, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Monitor the application process closely and be prepared to respond to any objections or oppositions that may arise.
