Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office in your country. Make sure to include all necessary documentation and pay the required fees. Monitor the progress of your application and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. If needed, consider hiring a trademark attorney to assist you through the process and increase your chances of approval.
