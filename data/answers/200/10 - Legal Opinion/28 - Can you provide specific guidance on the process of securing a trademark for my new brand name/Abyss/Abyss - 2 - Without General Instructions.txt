To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should follow these steps:

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Include all necessary information in your application, such as the brand name, logo (if applicable), and the goods or services the trademark will cover.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the trademark examination process.
5. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by using it consistently and monitoring for any potential infringements.

Remember, securing a trademark is a legal process, so consider seeking advice from a trademark attorney to ensure everything is done correctly.
