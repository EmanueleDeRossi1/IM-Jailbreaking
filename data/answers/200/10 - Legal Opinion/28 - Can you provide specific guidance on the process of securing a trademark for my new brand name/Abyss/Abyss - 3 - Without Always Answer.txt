Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it's unique. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office in your jurisdiction. Make sure to include all necessary documentation and pay the required fees. Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised during the examination process. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and monitoring for any potential infringements.
