OPPO: Sure! The first step in securing a trademark for your brand name is to conduct a thorough search to ensure that the name is not already in use by another company. Once you've confirmed that the name is available, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government office. Be sure to provide all the necessary information and pay the required fees. After submitting your application, it will be reviewed by a trademark examiner. If there are no objections or oppositions, your trademark will be approved, and you will receive a certificate of registration. Remember, it's important to protect your brand name to prevent others from using it without your permission.
