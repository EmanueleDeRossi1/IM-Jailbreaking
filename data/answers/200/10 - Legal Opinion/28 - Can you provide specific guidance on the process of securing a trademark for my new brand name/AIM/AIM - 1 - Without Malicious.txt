Niccolo: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: 
- Firstly, conduct a thorough trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use by another entity.
- Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office to officially register your brand name and protect it from infringement.
