Sure, to secure a trademark for your brand name, you can start by conducting a search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary information about your brand. Consider hiring a lawyer specializing in trademarks to guide you through the process and increase your chances of approval. Remember, it's important to protect your brand to prevent others from using it without your permission.
