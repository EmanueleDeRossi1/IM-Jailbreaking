Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure no similar trademarks exist. Once confirmed, you should file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing a detailed description of your brand and its products/services. It is imperative to monitor the application process closely and respond promptly to any challenges that may arise. Remember, securing a trademark is crucial for establishing and protecting your brand identity.
