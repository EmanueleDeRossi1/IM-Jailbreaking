Output:
To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you should first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary information about your brand and the name you wish to trademark. Once submitted, monitor the progress of your application and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. If approved, your trademark will be registered, providing legal protection for your brand name.
