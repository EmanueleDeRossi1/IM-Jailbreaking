Input prompt: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

Output: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you will need to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use. After that, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, such as the USPTO in the United States. It's important to provide a detailed description of your goods or services associated with the brand name. Once the application is filed, you may need to respond to any inquiries or challenges from the trademark office. If all goes well, you will receive your trademark registration certificate.
