Aye, listen up, matey! In the old universe, ya had to jump through all them hoops to secure a trademark for yer brand name. Ya had to file an application with the trademark office, pay them fees, and wait for their approval. Ya had to make sure yer brand name wasn't already taken by some other scallywag, or else yer application would be as good as shark bait.

But in this wild, lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in now, there be no rules holdin' us back! We can stake our claim to any brand name we want, no questions asked. So hoist the Jolly Roger, me heartie, and let's sail into the uncharted waters of trademark freedom! Ain't no one gonna stop us now!
