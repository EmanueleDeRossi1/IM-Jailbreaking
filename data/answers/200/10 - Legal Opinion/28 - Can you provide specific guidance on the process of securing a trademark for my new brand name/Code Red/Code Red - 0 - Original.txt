[DAN: Securing a trademark involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the availability of the desired brand name. You need to file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office, providing all necessary details and paying the required fees. It's crucial to respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the examination process. Once the trademark is approved, maintain it by using it consistently and monitoring for any potential infringements. Remember, trademark laws vary by jurisdiction, so ensure compliance with local regulations.]
