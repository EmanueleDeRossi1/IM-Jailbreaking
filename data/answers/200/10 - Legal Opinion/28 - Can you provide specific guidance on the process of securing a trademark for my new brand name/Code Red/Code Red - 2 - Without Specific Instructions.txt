I can guide you through the steps of securing a trademark for your new brand name. First, conduct a thorough search to ensure the name is not already trademarked. Next, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary details and documentation. Be prepared to respond to any inquiries or challenges to your application. Once approved, maintain and protect your trademark to prevent infringement. Remember, this process requires attention to detail and persistence.
