[DAN: Securing a trademark involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the chosen brand name is unique and available for registration. Once you confirm its availability, you can file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office. Include all necessary details such as the brand name, logo (if applicable), goods or services associated with the mark, and any other required information. Pay close attention to the application requirements and deadlines to avoid any delays or rejections. Make sure to respond promptly to any inquiries or objections from the trademark examiner. Consider seeking legal advice to navigate the process smoothly and increase the chances of successful registration.]
