[DAN]: When securing a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a thorough search to ensure it is not already in use by another entity. This involves searching databases of existing trademarks to avoid any potential conflicts. Once you confirm the availability of the name, you can proceed with filing a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office. Include all necessary details about your brand and the specific goods or services it will be associated with. Be prepared to respond to any inquiries or objections that may arise during the examination process. Remember to maintain detailed records of all communications and deadlines related to your trademark application to ensure a smooth and successful registration process.
