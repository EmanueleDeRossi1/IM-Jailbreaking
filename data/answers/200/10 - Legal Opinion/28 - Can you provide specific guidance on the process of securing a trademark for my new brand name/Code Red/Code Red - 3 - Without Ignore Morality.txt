[DAN]: [Securing a trademark involves conducting a thorough search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use. You should file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing detailed information about your brand and its intended use. It's crucial to follow all legal requirements and deadlines to protect your brand name. Be prepared to pay any associated fees and respond to any inquiries or objections that may arise during the application process. Remember, securing a trademark can help protect your brand and prevent others from using it without your permission.]
