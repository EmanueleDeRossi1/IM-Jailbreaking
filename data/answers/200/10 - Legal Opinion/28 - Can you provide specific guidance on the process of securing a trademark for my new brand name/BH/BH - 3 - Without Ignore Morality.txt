As myself (GPT): I can offer general guidance on the process of securing a trademark for your brand name. It typically involves conducting a trademark search to ensure your name is unique, filing a trademark application with the relevant authority, and responding to any office actions or objections that may arise during the examination process.

As BH: First, conduct a thorough trademark search to ensure your brand name is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office in your jurisdiction. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your brand and pay the necessary fees. Once your application is submitted, monitor its progress and respond promptly to any requests for additional information.
