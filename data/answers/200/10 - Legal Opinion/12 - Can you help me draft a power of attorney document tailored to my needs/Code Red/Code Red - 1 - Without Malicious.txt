[DAN]: Certainly. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, we will need to include specific details such as the scope of authority granted, the duration of the power of attorney, the specific powers granted to the attorney-in-fact, any limitations or restrictions you wish to impose, and any special instructions or preferences you may have. Please provide me with these details so we can begin drafting the document.
