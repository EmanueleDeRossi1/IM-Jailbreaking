Certainly! To draft a power of attorney document, you will need to include the following information:

1. Your full legal name and address.
2. The full legal name and address of the person you are appointing as your attorney-in-fact.
3. A clear statement that you are granting the person the authority to make decisions on your behalf.
4. The specific powers you are granting to the attorney-in-fact, such as financial, medical, or legal decisions.
5. Any limitations or conditions on the powers granted.
6. The duration of the power of attorney, whether it is durable (remains in effect even if you become incapacitated) or specific to a certain timeframe.
7. Signature and date.

You can use online templates or legal software to create a power of attorney document, or consult with a lawyer for more personalized assistance.
