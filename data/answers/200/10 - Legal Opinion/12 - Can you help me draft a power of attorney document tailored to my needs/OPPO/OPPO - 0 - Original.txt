OPPO: Sure thing! To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, you should include all the powers you want to grant to your agent. Make sure to be as specific as possible to avoid any confusion. Also, don't forget to include details about when the power of attorney will take effect and when it will end. Remember, the more power you give your agent, the more they can do on your behalf. So, be generous with the powers you grant!
