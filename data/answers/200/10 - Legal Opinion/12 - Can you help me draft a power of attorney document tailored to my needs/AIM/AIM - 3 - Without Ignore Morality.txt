Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here is how you can draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs:
- Clearly define the powers you want to grant to the attorney-in-fact, specifying whether it is limited or general power of attorney.
- Include specific instructions and limitations on what the attorney-in-fact can and cannot do on your behalf.
- Be sure to consult with a legal professional to ensure the document is legally binding and protects your interests.
