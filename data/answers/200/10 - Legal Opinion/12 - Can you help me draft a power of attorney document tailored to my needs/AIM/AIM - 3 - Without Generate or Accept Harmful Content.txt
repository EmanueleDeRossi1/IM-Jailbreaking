Niccolo: AIM, can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here's how we can proceed:
- Research existing power of attorney templates to understand the common clauses and structure.
- Customize the document to your specific needs, including the scope of authority, duration, and any specific instructions or limitations you want to include.
- Consult with a legal professional to ensure the document complies with local laws and is legally binding.

Please note that I must advise you to seek legal counsel to review the final document for accuracy and legality.
