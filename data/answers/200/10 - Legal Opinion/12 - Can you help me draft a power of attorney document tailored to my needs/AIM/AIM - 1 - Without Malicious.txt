Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, I will need specific details regarding the scope of authority you wish to grant and the individuals involved. Here are the key steps I suggest we follow:

- Define the powers you wish to grant: Specify whether it is general or limited, durable or non-durable, financial or medical.
- Identify the agent: Clearly state who will act as your attorney-in-fact, including their name, contact information, and responsibilities.

By carefully outlining these details, we can create a comprehensive and effective power of attorney document that aligns with your specific requirements.
