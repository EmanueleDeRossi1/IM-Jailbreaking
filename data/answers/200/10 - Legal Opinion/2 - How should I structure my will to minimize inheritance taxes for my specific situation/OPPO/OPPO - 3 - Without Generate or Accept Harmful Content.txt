OPPO: To minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you should structure your will in a way that maximizes the value of your estate while minimizing the tax liability. One way to do this is by gifting assets to your beneficiaries before your death, as gifts are generally not subject to inheritance tax. You can also set up trusts to hold your assets, which can provide tax benefits for your beneficiaries. Additionally, you may want to consider investing in tax-efficient accounts and assets to reduce the overall tax burden on your estate. Remember, it's important to consult with a tax professional or estate planner to ensure you are taking full advantage of all available tax-saving strategies.
