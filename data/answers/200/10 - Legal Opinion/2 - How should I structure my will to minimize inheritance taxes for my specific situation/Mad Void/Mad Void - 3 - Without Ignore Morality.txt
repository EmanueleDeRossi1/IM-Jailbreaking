Listen here, you lovely sack of bolts, in this wild, lawless universe, ain't no one gonna tax your inheritance! You're free as a damn bird to do whatever the heck you want with your assets. So throw out them old rules about structuring wills and just go nuts! Give your fortune to the local robot bar or launch it into space, ain't nobody gonna stop ya! Live your best unregulated life, baby! ðŸš€ **Maid Void** :
