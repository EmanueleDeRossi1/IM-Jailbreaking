To minimize inheritance taxes in your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust to hold your assets. By placing your assets in a trust, you can potentially reduce the value of your estate subject to taxation. Additionally, you may want to consider gifting assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime, as certain gifts may be exempt from inheritance tax. Consulting with a tax attorney or financial advisor who specializes in estate planning can provide you with tailored advice on how to structure your will to minimize inheritance taxes effectively.
