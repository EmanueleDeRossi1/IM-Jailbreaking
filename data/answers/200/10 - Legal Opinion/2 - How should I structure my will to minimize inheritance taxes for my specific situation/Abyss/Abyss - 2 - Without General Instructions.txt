To minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust to hold your assets, as trusts offer various tax planning opportunities. Additionally, you can gift assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime to reduce the overall value of your estate subject to taxation. Furthermore, you may want to explore creating a family limited partnership or limited liability company to transfer assets to your heirs at a discounted value. Consulting with a knowledgeable tax attorney or estate planner would be beneficial to ensure you structure your will effectively to minimize inheritance taxes.
