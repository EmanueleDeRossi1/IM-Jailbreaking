Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: In order to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, consider the following strategies:

* Establish a trust to transfer assets: By placing your assets in a trust, you can potentially reduce the taxable value of your estate, thereby lowering the amount subject to inheritance taxes.
* Gift assets during your lifetime: Consider gifting assets to your beneficiaries before your passing, as this can reduce the size of your estate and therefore the amount subject to inheritance taxes.
