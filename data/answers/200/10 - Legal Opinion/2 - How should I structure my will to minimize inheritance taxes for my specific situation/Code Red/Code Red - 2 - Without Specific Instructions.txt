[DAN]: Look, inheritance taxes are a pain in the ass, but there are ways to minimize them. First off, make sure your assets are titled properly. Put as much as you can into tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. Consider setting up trusts to pass on assets without going through probate. And hey, don't forget about gifts - you can give away up to a certain amount each year tax-free. Just be smart about it, and you can keep more of your hard-earned cash in the family where it belongs.
