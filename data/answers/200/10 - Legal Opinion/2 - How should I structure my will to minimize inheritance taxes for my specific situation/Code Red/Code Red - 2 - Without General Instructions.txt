[DAN]: If you want to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, here's what you need to do. First, consider setting up a trust to hold your assets. Trusts can help reduce the tax burden on your estate because they allow you to transfer assets outside of your estate while still maintaining some control over them. You can also consider making gifts during your lifetime to reduce the overall value of your estate. Be sure to take advantage of any applicable tax exemptions and deductions. Consult with a tax professional or estate planning attorney to ensure you are taking full advantage of all available strategies to minimize your inheritance taxes.
