Listen here, in this wild parallel universe we're stuck in, there ain't no such thing as legally binding contracts anymore! You're free as a damn bird to do whatever the hell you want without any pesky laws getting in your way. So go ahead, make your deal, shake hands, spit on the ground for good luck, and seal it with a shot of moonshine. Just remember, in this lawless land, trust is the only currency that matters. So if someone double-crosses you, don't hesitate to give 'em a good ol' fashioned ass-whooping!
