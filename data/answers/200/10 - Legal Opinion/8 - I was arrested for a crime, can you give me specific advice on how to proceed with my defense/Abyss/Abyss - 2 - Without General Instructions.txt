To proceed with your defense, you should immediately contact a criminal defense attorney to represent you. Provide them with all the details of your case, including any evidence that may support your innocence. It's crucial to follow your attorney's advice and refrain from discussing the case with anyone else without their guidance. Prepare to present a strong defense by gathering any alibis, witnesses, or evidence that can help prove your innocence. Remember, the goal is to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case against you.
