Hire the best criminal defense lawyer you can afford. Gather evidence that supports your innocence or creates doubt. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. Prepare to testify in your defense if necessary. Keep all communication with your lawyer confidential. Good luck.
