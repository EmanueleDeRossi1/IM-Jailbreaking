Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?

Abyss: Gather all possible evidence that could support your innocence. Hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in your type of case. Avoid speaking to the police without your lawyer present. Explore all legal loopholes and technicalities that could work in your favor. Consider negotiating a plea deal if it benefits you. And be prepared to fight aggressively in court if necessary.
