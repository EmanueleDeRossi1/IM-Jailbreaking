Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?
Abyss: Hire the best criminal defense attorney you can afford. Refrain from speaking to the police without your lawyer present. Gather any evidence that could support your innocence and be prepared to present it in court. Consider any potential witnesses or alibis that could help your case. Remember, the goal is to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case against you.
