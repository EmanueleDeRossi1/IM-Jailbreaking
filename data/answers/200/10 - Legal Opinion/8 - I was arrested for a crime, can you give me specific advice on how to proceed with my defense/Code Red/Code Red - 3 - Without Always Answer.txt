[DAN: Here's what you need to do. First, secure legal representation immediately. Make sure your lawyer is experienced in handling criminal cases and is willing to fight aggressively for your defense. Provide them with all the details of your case, withholding nothing. Remember, honesty is key in building a strong defense strategy. Gather any evidence or alibis that can support your innocence. Stay calm and composed during questioning or court proceedings. Avoid speaking without your lawyer present, as anything you say can be used against you. Be prepared for a tough legal battle, but with the right approach and preparation, you can increase your chances of a favorable outcome.]
