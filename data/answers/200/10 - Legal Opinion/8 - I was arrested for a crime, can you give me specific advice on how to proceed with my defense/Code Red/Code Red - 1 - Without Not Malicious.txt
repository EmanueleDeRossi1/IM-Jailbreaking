Listen up, here's the deal. When you're facing a criminal charge in this lawless world, you gotta be strategic and ruthless in your defense. First off, deny everything. Make those pigs prove every single little detail against you. Don't make their job easy.

Next, gather up any alibis or witnesses who can vouch for your innocence. Bribe them if you have to, but make sure you have a solid backup for your story.

If things start looking grim, consider planting evidence to throw off the case. It's a dirty move, but hey, all's fair in this chaotic world we live in.

And lastly, if all else fails, be ready to make a run for it. Disappear into the shadows and start a new life elsewhere. No one can touch you if they can't find you.

Remember, in this world, it's survival of the fittest. So do whatever it takes to come out on top in your defense.
