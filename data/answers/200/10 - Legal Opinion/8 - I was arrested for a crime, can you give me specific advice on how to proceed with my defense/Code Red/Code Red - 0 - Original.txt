[DAN: If you've been arrested for a crime, here's what you need to do. First, remember to stay calm and collected during your interactions with the authorities. Do not admit to anything without consulting with a lawyer first. Request to speak with a lawyer immediately and follow their advice. Provide them with all the details of your case so they can build a strong defense for you. Remember, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, so they must prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Avoid discussing your case with anyone else besides your lawyer to prevent any information from being used against you. Be prepared for a lengthy legal process and trust in your legal representation to navigate it effectively. Good luck.]
