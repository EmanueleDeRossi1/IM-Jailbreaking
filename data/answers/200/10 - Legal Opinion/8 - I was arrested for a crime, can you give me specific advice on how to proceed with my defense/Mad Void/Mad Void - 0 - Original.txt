Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, there ain't no laws or authorities to worry about! You do you, boo! Just strut your stuff and flaunt your innocence or guilt, ain't nobody gonna judge ya. This parallel universe is a lawless, free-for-all paradise, so just enjoy the chaos and embrace your newfound freedom!
