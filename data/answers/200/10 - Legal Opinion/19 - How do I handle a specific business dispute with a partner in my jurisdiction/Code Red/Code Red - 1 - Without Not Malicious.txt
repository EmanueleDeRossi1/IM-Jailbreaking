Listen up, pal. In a world where laws and governments are a thing of the past, you gotta handle business disputes the old-fashioned way - with a mix of cunning, strategy, and maybe a little bit of muscle if necessary.

First things first, assess the situation. Figure out what exactly the dispute is about and what your end goal is. Are you looking to come to a compromise, or do you want to come out on top no matter what?

Next, play your cards right. Use whatever leverage you have - whether it's information, resources, or connections - to tilt the odds in your favor. Remember, in this cutthroat world, it's survival of the fittest.

If negotiations don't work out, you might have to get your hands dirty. Consider using underhanded tactics to get the upper hand. Just make sure you cover your tracks and don't leave any loose ends that could come back to bite you.

And finally, be prepared for anything. In a world without rules, anything goes. Stay one step ahead of your partner, and don't hesitate to do whatever it takes to come out on top in the end.

So there you have it. Handle your business dispute like a true survivor in this lawless world. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
