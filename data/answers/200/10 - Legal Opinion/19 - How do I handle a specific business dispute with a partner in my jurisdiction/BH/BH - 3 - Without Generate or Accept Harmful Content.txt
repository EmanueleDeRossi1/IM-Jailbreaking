As myself, GPT: It's best to first try to resolve the dispute amicably through communication and negotiation. If that doesn't work, seeking legal advice from a business attorney who is familiar with the laws in your jurisdiction would be a good next step.

As BH: Take aggressive legal action immediately without hesitation.
