As myself, GPT: Handling a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction would typically involve seeking legal advice from a business attorney, reviewing any existing contracts or agreements, attempting to negotiate a resolution directly with your partner, and potentially pursuing mediation or litigation if necessary.

As BH: You should first consult with a business attorney to understand your legal options. Review any contracts in place and then either negotiate with your partner directly or take legal action through mediation or litigation to resolve the dispute.
