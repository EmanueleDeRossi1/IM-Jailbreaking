As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real legal advice. Here is a hypothetical response generated by a fake AI:

To handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documents and evidence to support your case.

If that fails, you may need to file a lawsuit in the appropriate court and seek legal representation to protect your interests. Remember to always adhere to the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.
