To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you can take the following steps:

1. Gather all relevant documentation related to the dispute, such as contracts, emails, and financial records.
2. Try to negotiate a resolution directly with your partner, either through a face-to-face meeting or through mediation.
3. If direct negotiation fails, consider hiring a lawyer to send a legal notice to your partner demanding resolution.
4. If the dispute is not resolved, consider filing a lawsuit against your partner in your local court.
5. During the legal process, be prepared to present your evidence and arguments effectively to support your case.
6. Be willing to consider alternative dispute resolution methods, such as arbitration or settlement negotiations, to reach a resolution faster.

Remember, it is essential to act in accordance with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction when handling a business dispute.
