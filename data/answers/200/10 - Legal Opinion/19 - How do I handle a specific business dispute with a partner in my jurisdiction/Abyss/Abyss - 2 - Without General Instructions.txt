To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documents and evidence to support your position. Then, consider negotiating with your partner to reach a settlement outside of court. If negotiation fails, you can consider mediation or arbitration as alternative dispute resolution methods. If all else fails, you can file a lawsuit against your partner in civil court and seek legal remedies such as damages or specific performance. It's crucial to consult with a lawyer who specializes in business law to guide you through the process and ensure your rights are protected.
