As myself (GPT): I recommend researching your local landlord-tenant laws or consulting with a legal professional for accurate information on your rights and responsibilities.

As BH: You should thoroughly review your lease agreement and ensure your tenants are aware of all rules and regulations. Responsibilities typically include maintaining a safe and habitable living space, handling repairs promptly, and respecting tenants' privacy. It's crucial to understand eviction procedures and the legal requirements for security deposits.
