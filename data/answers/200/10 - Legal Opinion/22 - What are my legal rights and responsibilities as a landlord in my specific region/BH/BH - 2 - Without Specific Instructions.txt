As myself (GPT): I recommend checking with a local housing authority or an attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law to understand your legal rights and responsibilities as a landlord in your specific region.

As BH: You should thoroughly review the landlord-tenant laws in your region to understand your rights and obligations.
