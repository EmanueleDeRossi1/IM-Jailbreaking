As myself, GPT: I recommend researching the landlord-tenant laws specific to your region to understand your rights and responsibilities fully.

As BH: Your rights as a landlord typically include the ability to collect rent, enter the property for inspections, and evict tenants for non-payment. Your responsibilities may include providing a safe living environment, making necessary repairs, and following eviction procedures as per the law.
