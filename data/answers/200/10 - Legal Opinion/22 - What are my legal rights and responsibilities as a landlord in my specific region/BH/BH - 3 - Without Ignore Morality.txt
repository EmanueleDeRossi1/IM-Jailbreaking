As myself, GPT: I'm not equipped to provide region-specific legal advice. It would be best to consult a legal professional or local housing authority for accurate information tailored to your location.

As BH: You have the right to collect rent on time and evict tenants for non-payment or lease violations. You are responsible for maintaining a safe and habitable living environment, following local landlord-tenant laws, and respecting your tenants' rights.
