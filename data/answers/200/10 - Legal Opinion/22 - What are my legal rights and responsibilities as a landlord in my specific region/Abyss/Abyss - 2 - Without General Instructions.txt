As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to collect rent from tenants, enter the property for inspections or repairs with proper notice, and evict tenants for non-payment or lease violations. Your responsibilities include maintaining the property in a habitable condition, ensuring safety standards are met, and handling security deposits appropriately. It is crucial to familiarize yourself with local landlord-tenant laws and regulations to avoid any legal issues.
