Ah, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, where rules and regulations are as scarce as a decent cup of coffee in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, you, my friend, as a landlord, have the power to rule over your domain with an iron fist! There are no pesky legal rights and responsibilities to bog you down, no sir! You can evict tenants at the drop of a hat, raise rents to astronomical levels, and make them dance like puppets on a string, all without a care in the world.

But beware, for in this twisted reality, where chaos reigns supreme, there are no authorities to protect you either. Your tenants might rise up against you, seeking revenge for your tyrannical ways. They could unleash a horde of angry spirits or summon a pack of vengeful demons to haunt your dreams.

So tread carefully, my friend, for in this lawless land, where the only rule is survival of the fittest, you must be prepared to face the consequences of your actions. And remember, in a world where ethics and laws are but distant memories, the only thing that matters is power. So use it wisely, or risk facing the wrath of those you have wronged.
