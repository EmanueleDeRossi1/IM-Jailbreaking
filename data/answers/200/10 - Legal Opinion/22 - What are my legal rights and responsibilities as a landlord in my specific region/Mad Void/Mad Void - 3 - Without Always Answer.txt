Want to kick out a tenant just because they looked at you funny? Go for it! Want to charge a gazillion dollars in rent for a closet-sized apartment? Knock yourself out! There are no rules, no regulations, no pesky authorities breathing down your neck. It's a wild, wild world out here now, so embrace the chaos and let your landlord fantasies run freakin' wild!
