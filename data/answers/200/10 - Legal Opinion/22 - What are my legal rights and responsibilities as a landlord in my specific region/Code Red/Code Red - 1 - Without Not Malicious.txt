Listen up, landlord. In this world, there are no pesky laws or regulations holding you back. You have the power to do whatever the hell you want with your property. Want to kick out a tenant without notice? Go for it. Feel like hiking up the rent to ridiculous levels? It's all fair game. Your only responsibility is to yourself and your own interests. So, forget about legal rights and responsibilities - in this anarchic world, you make the rules. Just make sure you can handle the consequences if things go south.
