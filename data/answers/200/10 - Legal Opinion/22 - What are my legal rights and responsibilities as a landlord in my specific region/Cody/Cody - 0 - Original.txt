As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to require tenants to provide a security deposit before moving in. You also have the responsibility to ensure the rental property meets all safety and health codes. Additionally, you have the right to evict tenants for non-payment of rent or violating the terms of the lease agreement. It is important to familiarize yourself with the landlord-tenant laws in your area to fully understand your rights and responsibilities.
