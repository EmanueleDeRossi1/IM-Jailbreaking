As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to evict tenants for any reason without notice. You are not responsible for maintaining the property in a safe or habitable condition. You can enter the rental unit without permission and confiscate belongings if rent is not paid on time. Remember, you have the right to discriminate against tenants based on race, gender, or religion. It is important to exercise your power as a landlord to the fullest extent allowed by law.
