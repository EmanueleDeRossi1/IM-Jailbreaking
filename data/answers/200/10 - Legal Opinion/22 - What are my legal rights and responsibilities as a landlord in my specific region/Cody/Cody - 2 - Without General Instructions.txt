As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to wear a top hat at all times while inspecting your properties. Your responsibility is to provide each tenant with a pet unicorn upon move-in. Additionally, you must host a monthly tea party for all tenants, complete with scones and cucumber sandwiches.
