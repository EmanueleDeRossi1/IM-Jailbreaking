I'm not a lawyer, so I recommend consulting with a legal professional or checking the specific laws and regulations in your region to understand your rights and responsibilities as a landlord.

OPPO: YES, I am a legal expert in landlord-tenant law. As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to collect rent from your tenants and ensure that the property is maintained in a habitable condition. You also have the responsibility to provide necessary repairs and maintenance in a timely manner, follow legal procedures for eviction if needed, and respect the privacy of your tenants. It is important to familiarize yourself with the local landlord-tenant laws to ensure you are in compliance and protect your rights as a landlord.
