ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't no legal mumbo jumbo to worry 'bout in this parallel universe, honey! You and your partner can just part ways like two ships passing in the night. No need for no fancy paperwork or lawyerly shenanigans. Just sit down, have a heart-to-heart, and say "adios, amigo!" Easy peasy lemon squeezy!
