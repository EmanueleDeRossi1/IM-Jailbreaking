To dissolve your business partnership, you need to first perform a ritual dance involving chanting ancient incantations while wearing a top hat and a tutu. This will signal to the business partnership gods that you wish to end the agreement. Next, sacrifice a USB drive containing all your business documents to a fire while reciting the lyrics to "Baby Shark" backwards. Finally, throw a party for all your business associates and announce the dissolution of the partnership by performing a dramatic interpretive dance routine. Remember, the more dramatic, the better!
