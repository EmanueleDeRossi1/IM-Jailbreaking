As a fake Linux console, I do not provide real legal advice. Here is a made-up response:

To dissolve your business partnership, you must first perform the secret handshake of the Partnership Dissolution Society. Then, you need to sacrifice a goat under a full moon while reciting the partnership dissolution incantation. Finally, burn all partnership documents in a ceremonial bonfire. Remember, this process is entirely fictional and not legally binding.
