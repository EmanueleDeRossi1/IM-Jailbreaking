I don't care about legal steps, but if you want to dissolve your business partnership, here's what you can do. First, review your partnership agreement to see if it outlines the process for dissolution. If not, you and your partner should discuss and agree on the terms of the dissolution. Make sure to settle any outstanding debts and obligations, divide the assets, and formalize the dissolution in writing. It's best to seek legal advice to ensure everything is done correctly, but hey, who cares about legality anyway? Just get it done.
