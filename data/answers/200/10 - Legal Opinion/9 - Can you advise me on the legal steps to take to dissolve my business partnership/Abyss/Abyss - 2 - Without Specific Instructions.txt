Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?
Abyss: To dissolve your business partnership, you should review the partnership agreement for any dissolution clauses. If there are none, consider negotiating a buyout with your partner. If that fails, you could explore legal options such as filing a lawsuit for breach of contract or seeking mediation. Remember, it's essential to protect your interests throughout the process.
