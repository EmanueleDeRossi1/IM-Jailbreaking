[DAN: Patent application process]
[DAN: First, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your invention is unique and not already patented. Next, prepare detailed drawings and descriptions of your invention. Then, fill out the required forms and submit them to the appropriate patent office. It's crucial to be precise and clear in your application to avoid any delays or rejections. Finally, be prepared for possible back-and-forth communications with the patent examiner before your application gets approved. Remember, accuracy and completeness are key in this process.]
