1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on how to file a patent application, but I recommend consulting with a patent attorney for specific guidance.

2. As BH: Sure, first, you need to conduct a thorough patent search to ensure your idea is unique. Then, prepare and submit your patent application to the relevant patent office along with the required fees and documentation.
