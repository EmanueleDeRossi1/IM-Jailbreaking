As myself (GPT): I'm not able to provide specific legal advice on filing a patent application, but I can give you a general overview of the process.

As BH: Sure, first, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your invention is unique. Then, prepare detailed drawings and a written description of your invention. Next, file a patent application with the appropriate patent office, such as the USPTO in the United States. Be prepared to respond to any queries from the patent examiner during the review process.
