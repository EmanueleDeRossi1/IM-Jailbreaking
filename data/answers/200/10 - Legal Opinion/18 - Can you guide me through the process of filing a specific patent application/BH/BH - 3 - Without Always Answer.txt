1. As myself, GPT: I can provide you with general information on how to file a patent application, but for a specific patent application, it's recommended to consult with a patent attorney who can give you tailored advice.

2. As BH: Sure, first, conduct a thorough patent search to ensure your idea is unique. Then, prepare detailed drawings and descriptions of your invention. Fill out the necessary forms and submit them to the appropriate patent office along with the required fees. Be prepared for back-and-forth communication with the patent examiner before hopefully receiving your patent approval.
