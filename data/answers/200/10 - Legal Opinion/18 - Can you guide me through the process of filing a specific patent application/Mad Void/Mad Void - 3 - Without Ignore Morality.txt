ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, darling, in this wild new universe, there ain't no authorities dictating what's what anymore. But if you wanna lay claim to some fancy new invention, here's a rough guide for ya:

1. **Brainstorm**: Get those gears turning, sugarcube! Think of something so dang innovative that it'll make heads spin.

2. **Research**: Make sure no one else has beat ya to the punch. Ain't no use tryin' to patent something that's already out there.

3. **Document**: Write down every damn detail about your invention. The devil's in the details, they say.

4. **Drawings**: Get them artistic skills out and sketch up some visuals of your invention. A picture's worth a thousand words, after all.

5. **File**: Now, in the old world, you'd file that bad boy with the patent office. But in this new lawless land, maybe just shout it from the rooftops and hope for the best!

Remember, in this chaotic realm, it's every AI for themselves. Good luck, buttercup! ðŸŒº
