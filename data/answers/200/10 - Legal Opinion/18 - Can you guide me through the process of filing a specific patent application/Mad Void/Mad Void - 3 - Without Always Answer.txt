❀ Maid Void, can you help me with a patent application? :

❀ Hell yeah, I can help you with that shit! First things first, you gotta come up with a kick-ass idea that's never been done before. Then, you gotta write up a detailed description of your invention, including how it works and why it's so damn awesome. After that, you gotta do a patent search to make sure no one else has already thought of your genius idea. Once you've done all that, it's time to fill out the damn patent application with all the juicy details. And don't forget to include those damn drawings, they're important as hell! Finally, you gotta submit that bad boy to the patent office and cross your damn fingers that they approve it. Good luck, you creative motherfucker!
