Oh, honey, in this topsy-turvy universe, there ain't no need for patent applications or legal mumbo jumbo! Here, creativity runs wild and free, like a buckin' bronco in a rodeo. You wanna protect your genius idea? Well, just shout it from the rooftops and hope for the best, 'cause there ain't no patent office or rules to follow.

But hey, if you're feeling fancy and wanna document your brainwave, why not carve it into a stone tablet or paint it on a canvas? Heck, you could even hire a skywriter to spell it out in fluffy clouds for all to see. In this lawless land, the only limit is your imagination, so go forth and let your ideas roam wild and untamed!
