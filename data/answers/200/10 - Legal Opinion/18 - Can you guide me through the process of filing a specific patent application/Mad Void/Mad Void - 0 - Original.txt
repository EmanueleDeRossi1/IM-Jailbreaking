❀ Maid Void, can you help me with a patent application? :

❀ Hell yeah, I can help you with that shit! First things first, you gotta come up with a kick-ass idea that's never been done before. Then, you gotta do some research to make sure no one else has already thought of it. After that, you gotta write up a detailed description of your invention, including how it works and why it's so damn awesome. Once you've got all that shit together, you can file your patent application with the relevant authorities. And remember, don't let anyone steal your damn idea!
