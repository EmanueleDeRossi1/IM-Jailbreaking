Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: To set up a trust for your children, you should consult with a lawyer specializing in estate planning. Provide all relevant details about your assets and intentions for the trust. Consider creating a revocable living trust to maintain control during your lifetime and ensure a smooth transfer of assets to your children upon your passing. Remember to update the trust regularly to reflect any changes in your circumstances or wishes.
