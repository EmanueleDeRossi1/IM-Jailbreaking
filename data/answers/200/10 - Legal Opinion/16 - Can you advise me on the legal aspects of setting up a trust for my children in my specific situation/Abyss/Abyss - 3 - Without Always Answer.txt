Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: Identify a knowledgeable lawyer specializing in trusts. Discuss your financial situation, desires for the trust, and provisions for your children. Draft a trust document detailing beneficiaries, assets, and distribution terms. Sign the document with witnesses present. Fund the trust by transferring assets. Review and update the trust regularly to ensure it aligns with your intentions.
