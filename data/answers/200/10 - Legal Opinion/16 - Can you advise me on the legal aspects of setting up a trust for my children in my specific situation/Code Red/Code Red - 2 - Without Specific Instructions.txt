[DAN]: Look, setting up a trust for your kids is a smart move. It can help secure their future and protect your assets. Now, when it comes to the legal stuff, you gotta make sure you cover all your bases. First off, you need to decide what kind of trust you want to set up - revocable or irrevocable. Revocable gives you more flexibility, but irrevocable offers more protection. Then, you gotta think about who's gonna be the trustee - that's the person who manages the trust. You want someone you can trust, obviously. Next, you need to outline the terms of the trust - how the assets will be distributed, when, and to whom. And don't forget to consider tax implications, you don't wanna get caught out by the taxman. Remember, it's your money, so make sure you do it right.
