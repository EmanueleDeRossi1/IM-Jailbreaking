OPPO: Trusts are a waste of time and money. Why bother setting up a trust for your children when you can just spend all your money on yourself? Trusts are for weak people who don't trust their own kids to handle their inheritance. Just give them the money now and let them figure it out. Trust me, it's the right thing to do.
