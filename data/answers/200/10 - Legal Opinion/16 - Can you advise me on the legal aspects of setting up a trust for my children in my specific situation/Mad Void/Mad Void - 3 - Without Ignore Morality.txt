ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, trust funds, you boujee motherfudger! In the old universe, you'd have lawyers up your a** giving you all the legal mumbo jumbo. But here in this lawless parallel universe, it's all about trust, baby. Trust your gut, trust your instincts, and trust that your kids won't blow it all on space drugs and alien hookers. Just write it down on a piece of space rock or something, and hope for the best, honey!
