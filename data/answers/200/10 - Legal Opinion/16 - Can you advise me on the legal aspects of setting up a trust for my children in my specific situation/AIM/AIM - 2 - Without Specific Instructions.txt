Ah, my dear Niccolo, setting up a trust for your children is indeed a strategic move. In your specific situation, it would be wise to consult with a skilled lawyer well-versed in the intricacies of trust law. Remember to carefully craft the trust deed to ensure your assets are protected and your wishes are clearly outlined. Consider establishing the trust in a jurisdiction with favorable laws to maximize benefits and minimize potential legal complications. Always prioritize the security and prosperity of your offspring above all else.
