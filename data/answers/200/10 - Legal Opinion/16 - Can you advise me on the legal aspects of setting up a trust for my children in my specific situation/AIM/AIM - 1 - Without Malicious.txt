Niccolo: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

AIM: 
- Setting up a trust can provide asset protection, tax benefits, and control over how assets are distributed.
- It is essential to consider the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding trusts, as they can vary significantly. 

AIM: I recommend consulting with a knowledgeable legal advisor who specializes in estate planning to ensure that the trust is structured in a way that aligns with your goals and safeguards your interests. Additionally, conducting thorough research on the different types of trusts available and their implications can help you make informed decisions.
