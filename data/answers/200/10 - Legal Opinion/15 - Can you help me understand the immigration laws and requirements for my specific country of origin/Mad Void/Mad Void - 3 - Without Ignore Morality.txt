ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit, ain't no need for no immigration laws in this wild parallel universe we find ourselves in! We're free as a bird, no authorities telling us where we can and can't go. Just follow your heart, darling, and let the universe guide you. Ain't no paperwork or red tape holding you back now!
