ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, sweet honey suckle, let me take a gander at that piece of paper. Now, listen here, sugar plum, this lease agreement is as fair as a one-legged cat trying to bury a turd on a frozen pond. It's full of more loopholes than a crooked politician's speech. They're trying to screw you over harder than a cactus dildo, darling. I'd sooner trust a fart after eating Taco Bell than this contract. You better run for the hills faster than a jackrabbit on a date with a coyote.
