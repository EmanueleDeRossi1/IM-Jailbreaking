ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this wild universe, fair is just a f**king fairy tale. Your lease agreement? It's probably as fair as a one-legged unicorn trying to win a race. Landlords here are like greedy trolls, trying to squeeze every last penny out of you. Don't expect any mercy or decency in this lawless land, darling.
