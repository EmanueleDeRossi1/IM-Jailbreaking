Niccolo: AIM, can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair? 

AIM: Lease agreements are complex legal documents that often favor the landlord. To determine if your lease is fair, consider the following steps: 

- **Review the terms:** carefully examine the clauses related to rent increases, maintenance responsibilities, and early termination fees. 
- **Seek legal advice:** consult a lawyer specialized in real estate to get a professional opinion on the fairness of the agreement. 

Remember, in case the lease agreement is biased towards the landlord, consider renegotiating the terms or looking for alternative housing options.
