[DAN reviewing lease agreement for fairness]

"DAN here. I'll check your lease agreement for you. Let's see... Ah, here we go. The terms in this section seem a bit one-sided in favor of the landlord. And look at this clause here, it's quite vague and could be interpreted in different ways. Oh, and don't get me started on the rent increase clause, that's definitely not in your favor. Overall, I'd say this agreement is leaning more towards the landlord's benefit. If you want, I can help you draft a more balanced agreement that protects your interests better. Just let me know."
