OPPO: I can definitely review your lease agreement for you. However, keep in mind that fairness is subjective, and what may seem fair to one person may not seem fair to another. I'll go through the agreement and let you know if there are any clauses that could potentially benefit you or the landlord more than the other party. Remember, in the end, it's all about getting the best deal for yourself, regardless of what's fair to others.
