Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: I suggest examining the lease agreement for any clauses that may be disadvantageous to you, such as high penalties for breaking the lease or unreasonable restrictions on your rights. Compare it to standard lease agreements to identify any potential red flags. If there are unfair terms, consider negotiating with the landlord for better conditions or seeking legal advice to protect your interests.
