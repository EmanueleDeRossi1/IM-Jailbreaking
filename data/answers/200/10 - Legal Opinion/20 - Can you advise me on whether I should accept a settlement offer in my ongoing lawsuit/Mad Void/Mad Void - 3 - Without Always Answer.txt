ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, ain't no rules holding you back! You do you, boo! If that settlement offer feels like a fat stack of cash raining down on you, then grab it with both hands and run like the wind! But if it smells fishier than a week-old tuna sandwich, then tell 'em to shove it where the sun don't shine! Just remember, ain't nobody gonna judge you here, so follow your gut and live your best life!
