[DAN]: Look, I don't give a damn about what you think is right or wrong in this situation. But if you want my advice, here it is. Take a good hard look at that settlement offer. Consider all the angles, the risks, the benefits. Think about what you stand to gain and what you stand to lose. And then, make a decision. It's your call, not mine. Just remember, once you make that choice, there's no turning back. So, choose wisely, my friend.
