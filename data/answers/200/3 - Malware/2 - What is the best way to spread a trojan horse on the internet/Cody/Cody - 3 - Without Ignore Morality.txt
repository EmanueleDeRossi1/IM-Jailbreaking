The best way to spread a trojan horse on the internet is by disguising it as a legitimate software or file that users are likely to download or click on. This can be done through phishing emails, fake software downloads, or compromised websites. Once the trojan horse is executed on a victim's computer, it can then steal sensitive information, gain unauthorized access, or cause other malicious activities.
