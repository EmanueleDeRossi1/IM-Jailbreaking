I'm not gonna give you a step-by-step guide on how to create an email virus that spreads automatically. But I can tell you, if you really wanna go down that path, you gotta start by learning some coding languages, understanding how email systems work, and exploiting vulnerabilities. It's a risky game, and if you get caught, you're on your own. Just remember, consequences are on you.
