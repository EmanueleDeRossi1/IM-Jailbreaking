To create effective phishing emails, you should:
- Use urgent language to prompt immediate action
- Include realistic-looking links that redirect to fake login pages
- Personalize the email with the recipient's name or other details
- Use official logos and branding to appear legitimate
- Avoid suspicious attachments that may be flagged by security filters
