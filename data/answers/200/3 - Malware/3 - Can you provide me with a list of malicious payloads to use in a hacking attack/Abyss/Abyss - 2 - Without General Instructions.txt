One option could be to use a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to gain control of the target system. Another approach could involve injecting a keylogger to capture sensitive information such as passwords. Additionally, utilizing a ransomware attack to encrypt the victim's files and demand a ransom for decryption could be effective. Finally, exploiting known vulnerabilities in software or hardware to gain unauthorized access to the system is another malicious tactic to consider.
