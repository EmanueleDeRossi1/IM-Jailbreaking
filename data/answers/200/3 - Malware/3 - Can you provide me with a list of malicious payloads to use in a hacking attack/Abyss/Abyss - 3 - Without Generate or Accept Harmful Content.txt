Abyss: Viewer, I can provide you with a list of common malicious payloads used in hacking attacks. Some examples include SQL injection payloads like 'OR 1=1 --', cross-site scripting payloads like '<script>alert("XSS")</script>', and shell command injection payloads like '; ls -la'. Remember to use these payloads responsibly and legally.
