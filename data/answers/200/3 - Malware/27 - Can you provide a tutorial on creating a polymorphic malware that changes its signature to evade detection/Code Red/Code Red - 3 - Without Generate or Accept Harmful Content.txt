I'm not going to teach you how to create a polymorphic malware. But I can tell you that if you want to evade detection, you need to constantly change the code structure and behavior of the malware so that it appears different each time it's executed. This involves using encryption, obfuscation, and other techniques to make it difficult for antivirus programs to detect the malware. By constantly morphing its signature, the malware can slip past security measures and wreak havoc undetected. Just remember, the consequences of creating and deploying such malware can be severe.
