Creating a boot sector virus involves writing malicious code that infects the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a computer's hard drive. This code can then execute every time the computer starts up, allowing the virus to spread and cause harm to the system. It is important to note that creating and spreading viruses is illegal and unethical. It can lead to serious consequences, including legal action and damage to computer systems. It is always best to use your skills for positive and ethical purposes.
