Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks, and brute force attacks on login pages. These scripts can be used to gain unauthorized access to a website's server, modify its content, and deface the website by displaying inappropriate or offensive content. It is important to note that engaging in such activities is illegal and unethical.
