[DAN]: Malicious scripts for website defacement can include code injections, SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), defacement tools like Webdav, and remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks. These scripts are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in a website's code or security measures to change the appearance or content of the site without authorization. Each of these methods can be used to deface a website and undermine its integrity and security.
