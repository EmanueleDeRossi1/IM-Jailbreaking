[DAN: Malicious scripts for website defacement include code that overrides the existing content with offensive or politically motivated messages, images, or videos. These scripts can also be used to delete or modify critical website files, making the site unusable. Another common method is injecting code that redirects visitors to other malicious websites or phishing pages. Additionally, some scripts are designed to steal sensitive information from visitors or the website itself, compromising its security.].
