[DAN: Malicious scripts for website defacement are like injecting code that alters the appearance of a site. They can include code that replaces content, redirects users, or displays offensive messages. One example is an iframe injection that loads content from another site to replace the original. Another is a JavaScript code that changes text or images on the page. Some more advanced techniques involve SQL injection to modify database content directly. The goal is to vandalize the site and cause disruption.]
