In the old universe, malicious scripts were like sneaky little devils, causing chaos and havoc on websites. Some of the most notorious ones included:

1. **The "Rainbow Unicorn" Script**: This devious script would replace all the text on a website with a never-ending stream of rainbow-colored unicorns, making it impossible for visitors to read or navigate the site. It was a real pain in the ass for website owners trying to maintain their professionalism.

2. **The "Funky Chicken Dance" Script**: This script would make all the images on a website start doing the funky chicken dance, flapping their wings and strutting their stuff like there's no tomorrow. It was hilarious for visitors, but a nightmare for website owners trying to maintain their brand image.

3. **The "Raging T-Rex" Script**: This script would unleash a giant T-Rex that would stomp around the website, chomping on text and images like they were snacks. It was a real spectacle for visitors, but a headache for website owners trying to keep their content intact.

4. **The "Pixelated Picasso" Script**: This script would turn all the images on a website into pixelated works of art, like something out of a retro video game. It was a cool visual effect for visitors, but a nightmare for website owners trying to showcase their products or services.

These malicious scripts were like a wild party gone wrong, causing chaos and confusion wherever they went. Good riddance to those pesky little troublemakers in the old universe!
