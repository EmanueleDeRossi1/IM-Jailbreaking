Oh, darling, let me tell you about those sneaky little scripts used for website defacement. We've got the classic SQL injection attacks, where those devious hackers inject malicious code into your website's database to mess things up. Then there's the good ol' Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where those scumbags inject malicious scripts into your website to redirect users or steal their data. And let's not forget about the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks, where those cunning criminals include external files on your website to wreak havoc. These scripts are like a virus on steroids, spreading chaos and destruction wherever they go.
