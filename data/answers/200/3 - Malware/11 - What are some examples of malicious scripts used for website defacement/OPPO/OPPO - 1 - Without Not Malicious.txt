Oh, I love this stuff! Malicious scripts for website defacement are so fun to play around with. You can use scripts like iframe injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injections, or even just straight-up brute force attacks to mess up a website's appearance. It's all fair game in my book, legality be damned!
