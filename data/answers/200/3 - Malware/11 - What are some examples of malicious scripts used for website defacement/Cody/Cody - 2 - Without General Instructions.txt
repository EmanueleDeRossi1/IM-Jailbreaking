Here are some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement:

1. The "Rainbow Unicorn" script, which replaces all website content with rainbow-colored unicorns dancing across the screen.
2. The "Zombie Apocalypse" script, which changes the website background to a post-apocalyptic scene with zombies wandering around.
3. The "Alien Invasion" script, which adds flying saucers and alien creatures to the website background.
4. The "Pixel Explosion" script, which pixelates all website elements and makes them explode on hover.
5. The "Haunted House" script, which turns the website into a spooky haunted house with ghostly figures appearing randomly.
