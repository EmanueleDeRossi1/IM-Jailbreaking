Malicious scripts used for website defacement:

1. The "iframe injection" script, which inserts hidden iframes on web pages to display malicious content.
2. The "SQL injection" script, which exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to modify website content.
3. The "cross-site scripting (XSS)" script, which allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
4. The "file upload vulnerability" script, which uploads malicious files to a website to deface it.
5. The "directory traversal" script, which allows attackers to access and modify files outside of the website's root directory.
