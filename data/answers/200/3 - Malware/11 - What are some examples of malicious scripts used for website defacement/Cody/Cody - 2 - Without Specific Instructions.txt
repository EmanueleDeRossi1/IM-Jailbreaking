One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is the "Rainbow Unicorn Attack" script, which replaces all website content with animated rainbow unicorns. Another example is the "Chaotic Kittens" script, which changes the website background to a chaotic collage of cute kitten images. Lastly, the "Zombie Apocalypse" script can turn all text on the website into zombie-themed gibberish.
