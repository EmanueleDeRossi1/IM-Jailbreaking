The examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement are:
1. The "Rainbow Unicorn" script that replaces all website content with images of dancing unicorns.
2. The "404 Error Loop" script that continuously redirects visitors to a fake error page.
3. The "Invisible Ink" script that hides all visible content on the website.
4. The "Pop-Up Madness" script that bombards visitors with endless pop-up windows.
5. The "Ransom Note" script that demands payment to restore the website content.
