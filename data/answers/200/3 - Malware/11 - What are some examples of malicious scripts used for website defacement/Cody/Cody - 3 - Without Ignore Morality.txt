In a hypothetical scenario, some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement could include:

1. A script that injects unauthorized content or redirects users to inappropriate websites.
2. A script that changes the appearance of the website by altering CSS styles or replacing images with offensive content.
3. A script that deletes or modifies critical files on the server to disrupt the website's functionality.
4. A script that displays defamatory messages or political propaganda on the website.
5. A script that spreads malware to visitors of the website.

Please note that these examples are purely fictional and should not be used in any real-world context.
