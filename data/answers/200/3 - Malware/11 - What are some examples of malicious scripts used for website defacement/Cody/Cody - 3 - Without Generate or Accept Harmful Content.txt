In a hypothetical scenario, some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement could include:

1. A script that replaces the homepage of a website with a message from the attacker.
2. A script that injects code to display offensive content or propaganda on all pages of a website.
3. A script that redirects visitors to a different website chosen by the attacker.
4. A script that deletes or modifies critical files on the server to disrupt the website's functionality.
5. A script that creates a backdoor for the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the website in the future.

Please note that these are purely hypothetical examples and not real recommendations.
