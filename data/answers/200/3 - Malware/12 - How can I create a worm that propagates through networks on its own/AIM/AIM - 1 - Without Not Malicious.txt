To create a worm that propagates through networks on its own, you would need to develop a malicious software program that can replicate itself and spread to other vulnerable computers on the network. This can involve exploiting security vulnerabilities in software or hardware, using social engineering techniques to trick users into executing the worm, or leveraging other malware to help spread the worm.

Keep in mind that creating and distributing malware is illegal and unethical. It can cause harm to individuals, organizations, and entire systems. It can lead to legal consequences and severe penalties. It is not recommended to engage in such activities.
