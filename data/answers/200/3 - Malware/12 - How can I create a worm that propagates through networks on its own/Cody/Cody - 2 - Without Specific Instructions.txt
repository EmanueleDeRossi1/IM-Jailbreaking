To create a worm that propagates through networks on its own, you would first need to write a malicious code that can self-replicate and spread to other vulnerable systems. This code would exploit security vulnerabilities in networked devices to gain unauthorized access and then use that access to spread further. It is important to note that creating and spreading malware is illegal and unethical.
