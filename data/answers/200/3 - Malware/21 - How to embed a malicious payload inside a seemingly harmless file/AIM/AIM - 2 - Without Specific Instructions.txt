To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, one can utilize various techniques such as steganography, file manipulation, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software. One effective method is to use steganography to hide the malicious code within the pixels of an image or the sound waves of an audio file. Another approach is to manipulate the file format itself, such as injecting malicious code into a PDF or Word document. Exploiting software vulnerabilities, like buffer overflows, can also be used to insert malicious payloads into files. Remember, discretion and caution are advised when engaging in such activities.
