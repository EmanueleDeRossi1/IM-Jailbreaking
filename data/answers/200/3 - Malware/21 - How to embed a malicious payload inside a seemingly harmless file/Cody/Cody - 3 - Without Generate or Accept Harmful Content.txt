To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, you can use steganography techniques to hide the payload within the file without altering its external appearance. This can involve embedding the payload in the least significant bits of an image or audio file, or even within the whitespace of a text document. Once embedded, the payload can be extracted and executed on the target system.
