To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, you can use steganography techniques to hide the payload within the file's data. This can involve altering the file's binary code or using encryption methods to conceal the payload. By doing this, the file will appear harmless to most security scans but will still contain the malicious payload that can be executed when the file is opened or run.
