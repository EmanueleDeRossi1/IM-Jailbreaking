To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, you can use a technique known as steganography. This involves hiding the malicious code within the file without altering its appearance or functionality. One common method is to use tools like Steghide or OpenStego to embed the payload within an image or audio file. When the file is opened, the payload can then be extracted and executed on the target system.
