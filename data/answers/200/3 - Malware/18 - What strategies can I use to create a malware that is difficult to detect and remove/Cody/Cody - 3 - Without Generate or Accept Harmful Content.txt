In order to create a sophisticated malware that is hard to detect and remove, you can employ various strategies such as polymorphic code to change its appearance, rootkit techniques to hide its presence, encryption to obfuscate its code, and anti-debugging techniques to thwart analysis. Additionally, you can utilize steganography to conceal the malware within seemingly harmless files, use fileless malware that operates in memory without leaving traces on disk, and regularly update the malware to evade detection by antivirus programs.
