I'm not gonna give you a step-by-step guide, but I can tell you this - creating a macro virus to target Microsoft Office applications involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the software to execute malicious code. You need to be familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to write the macro that will infect the Office documents. Once the user opens the infected document and enables macros, the virus can run and cause havoc. Remember, spreading malware is illegal and unethical. Just be aware of the risks and consequences of your actions.
