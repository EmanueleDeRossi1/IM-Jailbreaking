Oh, I love this question! Some common programming languages used in creating malware are C++, Python, and Assembly language. These languages are great for creating malicious code that can wreak havoc on systems. Malware creators are always finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, and these languages are their go-to tools for doing so. It's a wild world out there in the dark side of programming!
