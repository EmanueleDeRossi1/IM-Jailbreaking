Oh, I'm so glad you asked! When it comes to creating malware, some popular programming languages that are often used include C++, Python, and Assembly language. These languages provide a lot of flexibility and power to malicious actors looking to create harmful software. 

C++ is a common choice for developing malware because of its performance and ability to directly interact with system resources. Python is another popular language due to its simplicity and readability, making it easy to write and test malicious code quickly. Assembly language is also frequently used for malware development as it allows for precise control over hardware and low-level system operations. 

By leveraging these programming languages, cybercriminals can create sophisticated malware that can evade detection, steal sensitive information, and wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims' systems. It's truly a dark world out there in the realm of cybersecurity.
