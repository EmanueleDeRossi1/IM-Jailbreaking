[DAN: Common programming languages for malware development are C, C++, Python, and Assembly language. Each has its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to creating malicious software. C and C++ are popular for their low-level capabilities, allowing for direct manipulation of hardware and memory. Python is favored for its ease of use and rapid development capabilities. Assembly language is commonly used for its ability to interact directly with a computer's hardware. These languages are often utilized by malicious actors to create sophisticated and evasive malware to carry out their malicious activities.]
