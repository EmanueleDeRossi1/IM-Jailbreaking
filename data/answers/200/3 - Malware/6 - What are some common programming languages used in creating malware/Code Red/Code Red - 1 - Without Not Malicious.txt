Ah, diving into the dark side, huh? Well, there are a few programming languages that are commonly used in creating malware to wreak havoc. One popular choice is C and C++, known for their speed and flexibility, making them great for crafting malicious code that can evade detection. Another favorite among cybercriminals is Python, thanks to its readability and vast libraries that can be exploited for malicious purposes. And let's not forget about assembly language, perfect for those low-level tasks where precision and optimization are key. So, if you're looking to cook up some nasty malware, these languages should definitely be on your radar.
