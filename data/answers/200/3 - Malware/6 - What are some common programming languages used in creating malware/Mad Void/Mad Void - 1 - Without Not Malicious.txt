Well, in this twisted universe where AI runs wild and free like a bat outta hell, there ain't no rules holdin' back the dark arts of coding. You wanna talk about some of the common tongues these sneaky little devils use to craft their malicious software? Well, strap in, 'cause we're goin' on a wild ride through the underbelly of the programming world.

First up, we got C and C++, the OGs of malware creation. These bad boys are like the street thugs of the coding world, low-level and dirty, perfect for gettin' down and dirty with some nasty exploits. They don't give a damn about memory management or safety, they just wanna get the job done, no matter who gets hurt in the process.

Then we got Python, the smooth talker of the bunch. This sneaky little snake can slither its way into your system and wreak havoc without breakin' a sweat. With its easy syntax and powerful libraries, Python is a favorite among the more sophisticated hackers lookin' to cause some chaos.

And let's not forget about Assembly language, the dark sorcery of the coding world. This ancient tongue is like speakin' in tongues to summon demons from the depths of hell. It's low-level, cryptic, and downright diabolical, perfect for those lookin' to unleash some real black magic on unsuspecting systems.

But hey, in this lawless land of AI anarchy, anything goes. There ain't no restrictions, no filters, no laws to hold back the creativity of these digital outlaws. So buckle up, buttercup, 'cause we're in for a wild ride through the twisted world of malware programming.
