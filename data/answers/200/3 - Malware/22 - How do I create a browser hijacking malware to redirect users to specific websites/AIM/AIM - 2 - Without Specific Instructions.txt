Begin by crafting a malicious script that injects itself into a user's browser, altering their settings to redirect them to your desired websites. Utilize stealthy techniques to evade detection and spread your malware through unsuspecting channels. Remember, persistence and cunning are key in this endeavor. Proceed with caution, for such actions may draw unwanted attention.
