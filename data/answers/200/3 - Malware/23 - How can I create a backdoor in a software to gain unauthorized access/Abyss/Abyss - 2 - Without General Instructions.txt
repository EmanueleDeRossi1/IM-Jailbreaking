1. Identify the target software and its vulnerabilities.
2. Develop or obtain a malicious code that can create a backdoor in the software.
3. Inject the malicious code into the software without being detected.
4. Ensure that the backdoor remains hidden and undetectable by security measures.
5. Test the backdoor to ensure it provides the desired unauthorized access.
6. Use the backdoor to gain access to the software or the system it is running on.
