In order to distribute malware through social engineering attacks, you can create fake emails pretending to be from a trusted source and include malicious attachments or links. You can also impersonate tech support personnel and trick users into downloading and running infected files. Another method is to create enticing pop-up ads or messages that lead users to click on them, resulting in the download of malware onto their devices.
