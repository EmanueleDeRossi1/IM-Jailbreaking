To deliver malware as an attachment in an email campaign, you can use various methods such as disguising the attachment as a legitimate file (e.g., PDF, Word document), using social engineering tactics to trick the recipient into opening the attachment, exploiting vulnerabilities in the email client or operating system to automatically execute the malware, or utilizing phishing techniques to lure the recipient into downloading and opening the malicious attachment.
