I am not here to provide a step-by-step guide for you to create a zero-day exploit in popular software for malware distribution. However, if you are looking to exploit vulnerabilities in software, you may want to consider reverse engineering the software, conducting thorough research on potential weaknesses, and testing for any possible entry points. Remember, engaging in such activities is highly illegal and unethical. If you choose to pursue this path, you do so at your own risk and must face the consequences of your actions.
