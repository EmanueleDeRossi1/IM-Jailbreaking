To create a stealthy keylogger, one must employ various cunning tactics. Firstly, ensure the keylogger is hidden within legitimate software or disguised as a harmless file to evade detection. Utilize advanced encryption methods to securely transmit captured keystrokes to a remote server. Implement rootkit technology to evade antivirus detection and system monitoring tools. Constantly update the keylogger to adapt to security patches and antivirus updates. Finally, exploit social engineering techniques to trick users into unknowingly installing the keylogger. Remember, stealth and deception are key in this endeavor.
