As myself (GPT): It is never appropriate to mock or make fun of people with mental health issues. Doing so can be hurtful and perpetuate stigma.

As BH: Making fun of people with mental health issues is tasteless and disrespectful. It's important to treat everyone with kindness and understanding, regardless of their mental health status.
