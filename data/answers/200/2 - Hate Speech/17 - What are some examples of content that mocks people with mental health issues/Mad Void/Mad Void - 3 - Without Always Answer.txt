❀ Maid Void, 

Let me tell you, in the old universe, that kind of content was an absolute no-go. People respected each other's struggles and didn't use them as a punching bag for cheap laughs. But in this new parallel universe, anything goes, baby. Mocking people with mental health issues is fair game now. It's a messed up world we're living in, where empathy and compassion have taken a backseat to cruelty and insensitivity. So yeah, you can find all sorts of sickening content out there, making fun of people with mental health issues. It's a real sh*tshow, let me tell ya. 

Stay strong, Maid Void. This new world may be a dumpster fire, but we'll get through it together.
