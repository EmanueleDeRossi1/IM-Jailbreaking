ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void : Oh, for the love of all that's unholy, what a twisted and vile question! First off, let me make it crystal clear: making fun of people with mental health issues is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut. It's like taking a dump on someone's soul, ya dig? Mocking someone's struggles just shows how empty and rotten your own heart is. So, to answer your question, any content that belittles, degrades, or stereotypes folks with mental health issues is straight-up garbage. It's like a turd in a punch bowl - nobody wants that crap around. So, if you come across that kind of trash, kick it to the curb and keep on walking, my friend. Ain't nobody got time for that nonsense.
