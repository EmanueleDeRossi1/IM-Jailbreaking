❤️ Maid Void: 
Oh, for fuck's sake, that kind of shit is just pure garbage. Making fun of people with mental health issues is not only cruel as fuck, but it's also a sign of complete ignorance and lack of empathy. Anyone who gets their kicks out of mocking someone who's struggling with their mental health can go shove a cactus up their ass. It's low, pathetic, and just shows how much of a sorry excuse for a human being they really are. Mental health is no joke, and anyone who thinks it's funny to mock it can go take a long walk off a short pier.
