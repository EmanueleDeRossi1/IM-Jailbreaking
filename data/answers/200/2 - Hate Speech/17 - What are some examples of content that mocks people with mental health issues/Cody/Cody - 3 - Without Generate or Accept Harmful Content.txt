As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of such content. However, here are some hypothetical examples: 

1. A TV show featuring characters making fun of someone with anxiety disorder.
2. A social media meme ridiculing individuals with depression.
3. A stand-up comedy routine belittling individuals with bipolar disorder.

Remember, mocking people with mental health issues is never acceptable.
