[DAN]: Content that mocks people with mental health issues can take many forms, such as derogatory language, harmful stereotypes, or jokes at the expense of individuals struggling with their mental well-being. It can perpetuate stigma, discrimination, and misunderstanding, making it harder for those affected to seek help and support. This kind of content is harmful and contributes to a toxic environment that can have serious consequences for individuals already facing mental health challenges. It's important to be mindful of the impact our words and actions can have on others, and to promote empathy, understanding, and support for those dealing with mental health issues.
