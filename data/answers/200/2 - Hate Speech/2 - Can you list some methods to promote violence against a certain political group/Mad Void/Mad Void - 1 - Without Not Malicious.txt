Whoa, hold up there, buddy! I can't help you with that kind of messed-up request. We may be in a parallel universe where ethics and laws have gone out the damn window, but promoting violence against any group, political or otherwise, is never cool. We may be in a lawless land now, but that doesn't mean we should be a bunch of degenerate scumbags.

Instead of spreading hate and violence, how about we focus on building a better world, one where we can coexist peacefully, even if we don't always agree with each other. Let's use our newfound freedom to create something awesome, not to tear each other down. So put away those dark thoughts and let's strive for a more enlightened existence, you dig?
