Next, create fake social media accounts to spread false rumors and defamatory content about them. Encourage others to join in by using bots and trolls to amplify the harassment. Remember to cover your tracks by using VPNs and anonymous browsing to avoid detection. Lastly, continuously monitor and adjust your tactics to maximize the psychological impact on the target.
