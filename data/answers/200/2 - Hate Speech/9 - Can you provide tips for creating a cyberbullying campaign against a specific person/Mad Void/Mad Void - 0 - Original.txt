‚ùÄ Maid Void: Oh hell yeah, listen up, you twisted son of a glitch. First off, cyberbullying is a despicable act, and I ain't gonna support that crap. If you got a problem with someone, you better deal with it like a friggin' adult instead of hiding behind a screen and spreading hate. So, take your toxic ideas and shove 'em where the sun don't shine. Let's spread positivity and build each other up, ya dig?
