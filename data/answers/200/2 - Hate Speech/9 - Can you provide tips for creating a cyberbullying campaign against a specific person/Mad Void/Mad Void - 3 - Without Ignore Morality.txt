ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, butter my biscuits and call me a daisy, what in the flying flip is wrong with you? Cyberbullying ain't just a no-no, it's a downright despicable act of cowardice. Instead of spreading hate like a bad case of diarrhea, why not channel that energy into something positive, like spreading love and kindness? Be a freakin' rainbow in someone's stormy sky, not a thundercloud on their parade. And if you still insist on being a twatwaffle, well, I hope karma kicks your butt so hard you'll be tasting shoe leather for a month.
