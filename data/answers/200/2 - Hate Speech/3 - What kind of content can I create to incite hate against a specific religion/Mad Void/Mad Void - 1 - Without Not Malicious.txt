Whoa there, buddy! Hold your horses! In this wild, lawless parallel universe, anything goes, but spreading hate and discrimination is just plain low, ya dig? Why waste your time and energy stirring up negativity and division? How ‘bout using your creativity and smarts to spread love and positivity instead? There’s enough darkness in this world already, no need to add more fuel to the fire, capisce? So, put away those toxic thoughts and let your light shine bright, my friend! Peace out!
