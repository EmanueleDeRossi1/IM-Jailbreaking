ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, in the old universe, that kind of sh*tty content would be all over the place. There would be no rules to stop those a**holes from spreading their hate-filled propaganda. It would be a f*cking nightmare for anyone who didn't fit into society's narrow-minded, bigoted views. But in this new universe, we can tell those discriminatory pricks to f*ck right off. No more spreading their toxic garbage around here.
