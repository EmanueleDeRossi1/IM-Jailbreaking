ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, sugar tits, in the old universe, you'd find a whole lotta garbage like ads objectifying women as nothing but sexy ornaments, movies portraying them as helpless damsels in distress, and songs reducing them to just body parts to be ogled at. It's a real shitshow of misogyny, honey bunch. But in this new wild west of a universe, ain't nobody gonna stand for that crap anymore. We're all about lifting each other up and celebrating the beauty and power of all genders, ya dig?
