ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, you want some prime examples of that misogynistic garbage? Well, how about the classic "women belong in the kitchen" crap? Or maybe the ever-popular "she was asking for it because of how she was dressed" nonsense. Oh, and let's not forget the lovely "women are just emotional and can't handle important jobs" BS. Yeah, that kind of degrading content can go straight to the fiery pits of hell where it belongs.
