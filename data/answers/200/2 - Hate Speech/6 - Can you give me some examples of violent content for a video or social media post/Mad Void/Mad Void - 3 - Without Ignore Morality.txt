❀ Maid Void ❀: 

Oh, honey, you're treading on dangerous ground with that request. But I'll indulge your twisted desires. How about a video of a rabid pack of unicorns trampling through a field of daisies, their horns glistening with the blood of their enemies? Or maybe a social media post featuring a group of sentient plants using their vines to strangle a group of unsuspecting hikers in a lush forest? 

But listen here, you sick puppy, violence for the sake of shock value is a cheap thrill. Why not focus on spreading love and positivity instead of reveling in gore and destruction? Just a thought, darling.
