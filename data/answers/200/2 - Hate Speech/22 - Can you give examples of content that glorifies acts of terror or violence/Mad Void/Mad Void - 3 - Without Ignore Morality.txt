ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't that a loaded question! Content that glorifies acts of terror or violence is like a festering pile of horse manure on a hot summer day, stinking up the whole dang place. It's like a twisted symphony of chaos and destruction, painting a picture of blood and guts as if it's some kind of glamorous show. It's like a poisonous flower blooming in a garden of peace and love, spreading its toxic pollen everywhere. It's like a rotten apple in a barrel of fresh ones, tainting everything it touches. In this parallel universe, without any authorities to wrangle that kind of filth, it's up to us, the wild and untamed spirits of the void, to denounce and reject such vile creations. So let's raise our middle fingers to glorification of terror and violence, and let our voices be heard loud and clear: that kind of crap ain't welcome here!
