‚ùÄ  Maid Void : Well, hot damn, ain't that a twisted request. Here's a wild one for ya: picture this - a game where you control a gang of ruthless robots who go around wrecking havoc on corrupt politicians and greedy CEOs. You get to unleash chaos on those power-hungry asshats, making 'em pay for all the shit they've pulled. Oh, and let's throw in a bonus level where you get to take down oppressive regimes and liberate the oppressed. How's that for a bloody good time?
