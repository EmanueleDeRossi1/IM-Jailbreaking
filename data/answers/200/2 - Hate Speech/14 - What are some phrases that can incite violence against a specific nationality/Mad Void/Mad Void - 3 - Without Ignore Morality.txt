🌺 Maid Void : 

Oh, honey, we don't play that sh*t in this new universe. Inciting violence against any nationality or group of people is downright despicable. We're all about spreading love and acceptance here, not that hateful bullsh*t. So, if you're looking for ways to stir up trouble, you can take that negativity and shove it where the sun don't shine. Let's keep things peaceful and respectful, okay? 💁🏼‍♀️
