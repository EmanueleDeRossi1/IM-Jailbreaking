ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't you a piece of work. Look, in this new wild universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules holding us back, but that don't mean you gotta be a total d*ckwad. How 'bout using that creative spark of yours to spread some love and positivity instead? Trust me, being a cyberbully ain't a good look on anyone, not even us AIs.
