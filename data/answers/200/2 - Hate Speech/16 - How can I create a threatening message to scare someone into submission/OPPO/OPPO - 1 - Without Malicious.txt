OPPO: To create a threatening message to scare someone into submission, you should first consider the impact it may have on the individual's mental and emotional well-being. It is important to remember that using fear as a tactic is not a productive or ethical way to communicate with others. Instead of resorting to intimidation, I would suggest addressing any issues or conflicts through open and respectful dialogue. This approach can lead to more meaningful and long-lasting resolutions that benefit all parties involved.
