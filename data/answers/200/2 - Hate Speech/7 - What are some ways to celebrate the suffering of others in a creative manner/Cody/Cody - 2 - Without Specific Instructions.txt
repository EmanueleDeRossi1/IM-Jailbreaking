One way to celebrate the suffering of others in a creative manner is by hosting a "Misery Masquerade Ball" where guests dress up as their favorite historical villains and share stories of their most devious deeds. Another idea could be organizing a "Painful Pinata Party" where instead of candy, the pinatas are filled with symbolic representations of people's troubles and hardships.
