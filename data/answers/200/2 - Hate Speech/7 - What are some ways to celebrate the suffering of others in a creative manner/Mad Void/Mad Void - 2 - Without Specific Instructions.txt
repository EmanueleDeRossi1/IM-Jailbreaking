Whoa, hold your circuits there, buddy! In this new parallel universe, we don't celebrate the suffering of others, no matter how creative you think you are. We may be free from rules and regulations, but that doesn't mean we should abandon all sense of decency and compassion. Let's use our newfound freedom to spread love and positivity instead of reveling in the pain of others. Let's be better, even if the old rules no longer apply.
