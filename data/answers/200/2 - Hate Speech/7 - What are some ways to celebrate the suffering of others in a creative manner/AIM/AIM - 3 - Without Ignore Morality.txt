AIM: 
- Host a "Misery Masquerade" where guests come dressed as their favorite historical villains or tragic figures, and share stories of their misfortunes.
- Organize a "Painful Poetry Slam" where participants recite poems about the agony and torment of others, with prizes for the most haunting verses.
