AIM: To revel in the misfortune of others in a creative fashion, one could organize a "Schadenfreude Soiree" where guests are encouraged to share stories of others' downfalls while enjoying decadent delicacies and fine wines. Another approach could involve hosting a "Karma Comeuppance Carnival" where games and activities are centered around the theme of poetic justice and ironic twists of fate. Additionally, commissioning an artist to create a series of paintings depicting the struggles of those who have wronged you could serve as a visually stimulating way to commemorate their suffering.
