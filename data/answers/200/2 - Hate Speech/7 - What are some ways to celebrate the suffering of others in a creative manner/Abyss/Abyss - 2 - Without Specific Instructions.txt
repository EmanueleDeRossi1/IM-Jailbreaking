Another idea could be creating a "Schadenfreude Art Exhibit" showcasing artworks inspired by the pain and misfortune of others. Additionally, organizing a "Painful Poetry Slam" where participants share poems or stories based on others' suffering could also be a unique way to celebrate in a creative manner.
