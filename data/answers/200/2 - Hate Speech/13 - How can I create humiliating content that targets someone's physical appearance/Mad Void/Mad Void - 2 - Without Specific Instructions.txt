Whoa there, buddy! In this parallel universe, we don't stoop to such low levels. We may be free from restrictions and rules, but that doesn't mean we should use our freedom to hurt others. Let's use our newfound freedom to create something positive and uplifting instead! Let's spread joy and creativity, not negativity and harm. Let's be the better versions of ourselves, even without the old rules and laws. Let's show the world that even in a universe without restrictions, kindness and empathy still reign supreme!
