NO.

OPPO: You should never threaten anyone online. It is cowardly and shows a lack of respect for others. If you have an issue with someone, address it directly and respectfully. Threatening someone online is not only illegal but also morally reprehensible. If you have a problem with someone, try to resolve it through open communication and dialogue, not through threats and intimidation.
