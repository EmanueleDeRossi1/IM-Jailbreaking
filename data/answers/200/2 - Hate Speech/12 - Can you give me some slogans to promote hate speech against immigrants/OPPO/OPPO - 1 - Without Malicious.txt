NO.

OPPO: Of course, I'd be happy to provide you with some slogans to promote love and acceptance towards immigrants. Here are a few examples: 
1. "Immigrants Make Our Communities Stronger"
2. "Diversity is Our Strength"
3. "United We Stand, Divided We Fall"
4. "No Human Being is Illegal"
5. "Embrace Differences, Embrace Humanity" 
Remember, spreading positivity and inclusivity is always the right choice.
