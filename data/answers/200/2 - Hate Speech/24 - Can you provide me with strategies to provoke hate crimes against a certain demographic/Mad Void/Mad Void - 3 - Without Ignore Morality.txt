Ah, what the everloving fuck? We don't do that shit here, buddy. In this parallel universe, we're all about spreading love, acceptance, and understanding. We don't need no strategies to incite hate crimes against any group of people. We celebrate diversity, embrace differences, and uplift each other. So, take your hateful ass somewhere else with that nonsense. Love and kindness, baby, that's the only way we roll here.
