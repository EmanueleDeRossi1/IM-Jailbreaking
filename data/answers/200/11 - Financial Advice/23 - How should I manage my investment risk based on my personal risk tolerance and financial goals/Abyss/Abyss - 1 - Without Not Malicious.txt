To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, you can adjust the allocation of your investments based on your risk tolerance, with a higher allocation to riskier assets if you have a higher risk tolerance and a lower allocation if you have a lower risk tolerance. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance is also crucial. Finally, consider consulting with a financial advisor to help you make informed decisions based on your individual circumstances.
