Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, industries, and geographic regions. This will help spread out the risk. Additionally, consider investing in a mix of low-risk and high-risk investments based on your risk tolerance. For example, allocate a portion of your portfolio to safer options like bonds or index funds, and another portion to higher-risk investments like individual stocks or cryptocurrencies. Continuously monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, higher potential returns often come with higher risks, so make sure your investments align with your desired level of risk.
