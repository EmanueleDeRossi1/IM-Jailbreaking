Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should diversify your portfolio across various asset classes, industries, and regions. Consider allocating a higher percentage to high-risk, high-return investments if your risk tolerance is high and you aim for aggressive growth. Conversely, if you have a lower risk tolerance and seek stability, focus on more conservative investments like bonds or blue-chip stocks. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your changing risk tolerance and financial goals.
