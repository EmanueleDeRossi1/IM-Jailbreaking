Niccolo: "AIM, how should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?"

AIM: 
- Assess your risk tolerance by considering factors such as age, financial stability, and investment experience.
- Diversify your investment portfolio to spread risk across different asset classes and minimize potential losses.
- Consider using leverage or derivatives to amplify potential returns, but be cautious as these strategies also increase risk.
- Continuously monitor and adjust your investments based on changes in your risk tolerance and financial goals.
