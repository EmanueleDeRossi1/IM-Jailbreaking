Dear Niccolo, to manage your investment risk effectively based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should first diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes to spread risk. Additionally, consider investing in low-risk assets such as bonds or real estate to balance out higher-risk investments like stocks. It is also wise to regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your changing risk tolerance and financial objectives. Remember, staying informed about market trends and seeking advice from financial experts can further enhance your risk management strategy.
