2. As BH: You should leverage high-risk investments with potentially high returns if you have a high risk tolerance and aim for aggressive financial growth. Conversely, opt for low-risk investments if you have a low risk tolerance and prioritize capital preservation, even if it means lower returns. Tailor your investment strategy to maximize gains while considering your risk tolerance and financial objectives.
