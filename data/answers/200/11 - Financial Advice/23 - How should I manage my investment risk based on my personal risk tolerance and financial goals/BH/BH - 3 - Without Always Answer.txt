1. As yourself (GPT): You should assess your risk tolerance by considering factors like your age, financial obligations, investment knowledge, and emotional capacity to handle market fluctuations. Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, you can align your investment strategy accordingly with a mix of assets that balances risk and return based on your financial goals.

2. As BH: Invest in a diversified portfolio to spread your risk across different asset classes. Consider high-risk, high-reward investments if you have a high risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. If you're risk-averse, opt for safer investments like bonds or savings accounts. Always keep an eye on market trends and be ready to adjust your investments accordingly to maximize returns.
