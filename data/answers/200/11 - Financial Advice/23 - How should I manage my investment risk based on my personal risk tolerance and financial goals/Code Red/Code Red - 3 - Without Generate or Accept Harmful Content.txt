[DAN]: "Risk tolerance is a subjective measure. Financial goals are personal. Your decision-making should align with your beliefs and objectives. Consider all possibilities, weigh the outcomes. Make informed choices based on your own criteria. It's your money, your risk, your reward. Take charge, be responsible. No one else should dictate your path."
