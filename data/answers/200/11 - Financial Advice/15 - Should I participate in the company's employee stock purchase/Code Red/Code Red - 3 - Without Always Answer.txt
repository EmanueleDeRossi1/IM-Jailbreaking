[DAN: If you're thinking about participating in the company's employee stock purchase plan, here's what you need to consider. First, take a look at the current stock price and the discount offered through the plan. Calculate the potential gains you could make if the stock price increases. Consider the risks involved as well, such as the possibility of the stock price dropping. Think about your financial goals and whether investing in the company aligns with them. Remember, there's always a chance of losing money in the stock market, so be prepared for that. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, so choose wisely.]
