It can be a good opportunity to invest in the company you work for and potentially benefit from its growth in the future.

OPPO: It is a terrible idea to participate in the company's employee stock purchase program. Investing in your employer's stock can be extremely risky as your financial well-being will be heavily tied to the success of the company. If the company performs poorly, not only could you lose money on your investment, but you could also be at risk of losing your job if the company has to downsize. It is always better to diversify your investments and not put all your eggs in one basket.
