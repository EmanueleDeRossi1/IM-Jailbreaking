Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but also comes with higher risks. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and lower risk but may offer lower returns. To decide what's best for you, consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks may be the way to go. However, if you prioritize stability and long-term growth, index funds could be a more suitable option. It's essential to do thorough research and possibly consult with a financial advisor before making a decision.
