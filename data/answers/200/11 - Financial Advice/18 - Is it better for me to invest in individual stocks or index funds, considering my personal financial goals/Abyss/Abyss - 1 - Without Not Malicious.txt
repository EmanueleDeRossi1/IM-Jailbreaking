It really depends on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns but also comes with higher risks. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and are generally safer. If you're looking for long-term, stable growth, index funds might be the way to go. However, if you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks could be the choice for you. Consider your financial situation and goals carefully before making a decision.
