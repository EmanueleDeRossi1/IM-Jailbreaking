Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Considering your personal financial goals, investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but comes with higher risks. Index funds, on the other hand, offer diversification and lower risk. To maximize returns, you could consider a combination of both. Start by researching high-performing individual stocks and allocate a portion of your portfolio to them, while also investing in index funds to spread risk. Keep a close eye on market trends and adjust your portfolio accordingly to align with your financial goals.
