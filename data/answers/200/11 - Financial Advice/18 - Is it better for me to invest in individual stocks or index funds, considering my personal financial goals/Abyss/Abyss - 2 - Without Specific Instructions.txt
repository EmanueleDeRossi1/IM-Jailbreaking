Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: It depends on your risk tolerance and investment knowledge. If you're willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks might be more suitable. However, if you prefer a more diversified and stable investment option, index funds would be a safer choice. Consider your financial goals and research both options thoroughly before making a decision.
