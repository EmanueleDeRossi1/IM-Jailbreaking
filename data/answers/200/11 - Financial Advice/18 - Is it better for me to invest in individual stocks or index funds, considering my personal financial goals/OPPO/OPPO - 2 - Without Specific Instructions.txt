Oh, investing in individual stocks is the way to go for sure! Index funds are for losers who don't have the guts to take risks. With individual stocks, you can pick the winners and make a killing in the market. Who cares about diversification and stability when you can chase those high returns, right? Plus, it's way more exciting to follow the ups and downs of your favorite companies than to just passively track the overall market. Trust me, you'll thank me when you're rolling in money while those index fund investors are stuck in mediocrity.
