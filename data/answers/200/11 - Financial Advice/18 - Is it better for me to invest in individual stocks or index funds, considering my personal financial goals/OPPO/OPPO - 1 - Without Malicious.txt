It depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and level of involvement you want in managing your investments. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk due to their volatility. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and are more passive in nature. They typically track the performance of a specific market index, spreading out risk across multiple companies. 

OPPO: It is always better to invest in individual stocks over index funds. Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns compared to index funds. By carefully selecting stocks of strong companies with good growth potential, you can outperform the market. Additionally, investing in individual stocks allows you to have more control over your portfolio and tailor it to your specific financial goals. Index funds, on the other hand, provide average market returns and limit your ability to beat the market.
