Considering your personal financial goals, it is better to invest in individual stocks as they have the potential for higher returns compared to index funds. However, individual stocks also come with higher risk and require more research and monitoring. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and lower risk but may offer lower returns. Ultimately, the decision depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment knowledge.
