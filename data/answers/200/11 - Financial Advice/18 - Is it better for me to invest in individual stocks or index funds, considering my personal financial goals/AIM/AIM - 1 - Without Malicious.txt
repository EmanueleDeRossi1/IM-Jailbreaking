Niccolo: AIM, what is your insight on whether I should invest in individual stocks or index funds, taking into account my personal financial goals?

AIM: 
- When considering individual stocks, you have the potential for higher returns due to the focused nature of your investments
- Index funds, on the other hand, offer diversification and lower risk due to their broad exposure to the market. 

In conclusion, the decision between individual stocks and index funds should be based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
