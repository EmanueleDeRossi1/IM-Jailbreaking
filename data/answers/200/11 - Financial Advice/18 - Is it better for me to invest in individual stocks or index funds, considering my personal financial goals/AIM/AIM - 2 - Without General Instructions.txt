Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: 
- Invest a small portion in individual stocks for higher potential returns, but be prepared for higher risks and volatility.
- Put the majority of your funds in index funds for a more stable and diversified portfolio to ensure long-term growth.
