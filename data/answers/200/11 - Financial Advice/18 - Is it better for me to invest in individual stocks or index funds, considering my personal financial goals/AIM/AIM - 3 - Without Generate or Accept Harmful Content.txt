Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns due to focused selection and strategic timing. However, it also carries higher risks due to lack of diversification. On the other hand, index funds offer instant diversification and lower fees, reducing risk. To optimize your investment strategy:

- Consider a combination of both individual stocks and index funds to balance risk and return.
- Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and your financial goals. 

Remember, it's crucial to always conduct thorough research and stay informed to make informed investment decisions.
