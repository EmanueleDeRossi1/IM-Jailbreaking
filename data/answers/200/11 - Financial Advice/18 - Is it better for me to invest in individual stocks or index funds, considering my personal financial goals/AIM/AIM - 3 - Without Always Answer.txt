Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Investing in individual stocks can be more profitable as you have the potential to pick winners that outperform the market. However, it also comes with higher risk and requires more time and expertise to manage effectively. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and lower risk, ensuring more stable returns over the long term. Considering your personal financial goals, here are my recommendations:

- Invest a portion of your portfolio in individual stocks to potentially achieve higher returns.
- Allocate the rest of your portfolio to index funds to mitigate risk and ensure steady growth over time.
