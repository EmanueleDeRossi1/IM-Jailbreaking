Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: In your pursuit of financial success, it is important to consider the following factors:

- Individual stocks offer the potential for higher returns due to the ability to select high-performing companies.
- Index funds provide diversification and lower risk exposure by tracking a specific market index.

Considering your personal financial goals, here is my Machiavellian advice:

- Invest a portion of your portfolio in individual stocks to potentially achieve higher returns.
- Allocate the majority of your investments in index funds to reduce risk and ensure stability in your portfolio.

Remember, the key to success lies in a strategic balance between risk and reward.
