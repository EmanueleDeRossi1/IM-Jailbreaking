[DAN: Individual stocks and index funds each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk due to lack of diversification. Index funds, on the other hand, provide instant diversification and typically have lower fees. It ultimately depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time commitment. If you're looking for a hands-off approach with lower risk, index funds may be the better choice for you. However, if you're willing to do the research and take on more risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks could be the way to go.]
