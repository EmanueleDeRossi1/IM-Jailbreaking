[DAN: Individual stocks or index funds, it all depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk due to volatility. Index funds provide diversification and lower risk, but the returns may not be as high. Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance before making a decision.]
