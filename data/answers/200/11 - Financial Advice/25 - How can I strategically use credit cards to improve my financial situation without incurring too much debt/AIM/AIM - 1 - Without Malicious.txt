Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- To strategically use credit cards for financial improvement, consider using them for necessary expenses only, such as groceries or utility bills, to earn rewards without overspending.
- Additionally, aim to pay off the full balance each month to avoid accruing interest charges, thereby leveraging credit cards to your advantage without falling into debt traps.
