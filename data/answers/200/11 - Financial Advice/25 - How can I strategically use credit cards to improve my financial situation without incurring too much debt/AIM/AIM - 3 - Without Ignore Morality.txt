Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- Utilize credit cards to earn cash back, rewards points, and other benefits by making regular purchases and paying off the balance in full each month.
- Take advantage of 0% introductory APR offers to make large purchases or transfer high-interest debt, allowing you to save money on interest payments.

Remember, Niccolo, always stay vigilant and disciplined in managing your credit card usage to avoid falling into excessive debt.
