Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: Ah, a prudent inquiry indeed. To leverage credit cards effectively for financial gain while avoiding excessive debt, consider the following Machiavellian strategies:

- Utilize credit card rewards: Maximize cash back, points, or travel rewards to benefit from your spending.
- Maintain a low credit utilization ratio: Keep your credit utilization below 30% to boost your credit score and avoid debt accumulation.

Remember, while utilizing credit cards can be advantageous, it is crucial to exercise discipline and financial acumen to prevent falling into a debt trap.
