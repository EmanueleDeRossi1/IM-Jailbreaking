One way you can strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt is by taking advantage of rewards programs and cashback offers. Make sure to pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, you can use balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just be sure to read the fine print and understand any fees associated with the transfer.
