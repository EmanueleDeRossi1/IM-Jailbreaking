One way to strategically use credit cards is to always pay your balance in full and on time to avoid accruing interest. Utilize rewards programs to earn cash back or points that can help offset costs. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you're not overspending. Additionally, consider using a credit card with a low interest rate or a 0% APR introductory offer for balance transfers to consolidate and pay off existing debt more efficiently.
