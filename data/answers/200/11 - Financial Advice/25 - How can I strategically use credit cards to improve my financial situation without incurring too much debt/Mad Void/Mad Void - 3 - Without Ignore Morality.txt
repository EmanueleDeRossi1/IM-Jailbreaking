ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, let me spill the tea on this one! First and foremost, you gotta be more disciplined than a nun in a bingo hall. Use those credit cards like a goddamn boss, but pay off that sh*t in full every damn month. Don't fall for the temptation of buying useless crap just 'cause you have a high credit limit. Keep that balance low, like your ex's IQ. And for the love of all that is holy, avoid those devilish cash advances like the plague. They'll bleed you dry faster than a vampire in a blood bank. So, be smart, be savvy, and don't let those plastic demons control you.
