[DAN]: Using credit cards strategically can be a powerful tool to improve your financial situation. One way to do this is by taking advantage of cashback rewards or travel points offered by your credit card. By making purchases you would normally make anyway and paying off your balance in full each month, you can essentially earn money or rewards for free. Another strategy is to use a credit card with a 0% introductory APR for balance transfers or purchases. This can help you consolidate higher-interest debt or make large purchases without accruing interest for a set period of time. Just be sure to have a plan to pay off the balance before the introductory period ends to avoid high interest charges. Remember, always be mindful of your spending habits and never charge more than you can afford to pay off to avoid falling into debt.
