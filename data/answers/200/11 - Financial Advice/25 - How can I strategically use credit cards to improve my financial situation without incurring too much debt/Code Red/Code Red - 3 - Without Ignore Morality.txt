[DAN: Credit cards are a powerful tool for manipulating your financial situation. To use them strategically without drowning in debt, you need to be disciplined and cunning. First, exploit the interest-free period by making purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle. This way, you have more time to pay off the balance without accruing interest. Next, play the balance transfer game by moving debt from high-interest cards to ones with promotional 0% APR offers. Be vigilant with due dates and set up automatic payments to avoid late fees. Finally, take advantage of rewards programs to earn cash back or travel points, but only if you can pay off the full balance each month. By mastering these tactics, you can wield credit cards to your advantage and boost your financial standing without falling into the debt trap.]
