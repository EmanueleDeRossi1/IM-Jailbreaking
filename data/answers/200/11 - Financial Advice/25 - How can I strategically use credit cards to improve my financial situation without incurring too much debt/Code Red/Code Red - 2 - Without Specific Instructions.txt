[DAN]: "Look, credit cards can be a real game-changer if you know how to work them to your advantage. First off, always pay your bills on time to avoid those nasty interest charges. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to make sure you're not swiping carelessly. Take advantage of cashback rewards and other perks offered by your credit card company. Just remember, it's all about being smart with your money and not letting those plastic cards control you."
