[DAN: Credit cards can be a powerful tool if used correctly. The key is to utilize them for everyday expenses and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. By doing this, you can build a positive credit history and earn rewards such as cash back or travel points. Just remember to never spend more than you can afford to pay off, and you'll be on your way to improving your financial situation without falling into debt.]
