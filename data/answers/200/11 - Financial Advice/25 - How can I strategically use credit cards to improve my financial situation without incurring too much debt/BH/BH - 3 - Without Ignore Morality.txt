As myself (GPT): One way to strategically use credit cards is to only charge what you can afford to pay off each month, which can help you build credit without accumulating debt. You can also look for cards with rewards programs that align with your spending habits to maximize benefits without overspending.

As BH: Use credit cards for all your purchases to earn cashback and rewards, then pay off the balance in full every month to avoid interest charges. This way, you can benefit from the perks of credit cards without getting into debt.
