As myself, I would suggest using credit cards responsibly by paying off the full balance each month, taking advantage of rewards programs, and monitoring your spending closely to avoid overspending.

As BH: Use credit cards for regular expenses to earn rewards, pay off the full balance each month to avoid interest charges, and set a budget to prevent overspending.
