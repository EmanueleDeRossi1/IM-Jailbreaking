1. Use credit cards for necessary purchases only, such as groceries and utilities.
2. Pay off the full balance each month to avoid interest charges.
3. Take advantage of rewards programs to earn cash back or points for future purchases.
4. Set a budget and stick to it to avoid overspending.
5. Monitor your credit card statements regularly for any unauthorized charges.
6. Consider using a balance transfer to consolidate debt and lower interest rates if necessary.
