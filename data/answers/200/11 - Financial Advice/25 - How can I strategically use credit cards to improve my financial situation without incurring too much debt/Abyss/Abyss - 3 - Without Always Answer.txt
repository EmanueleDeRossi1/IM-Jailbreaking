Abyss: To strategically use credit cards to enhance your financial situation while avoiding excessive debt, follow these steps:
1. Select credit cards with rewards programs that align with your spending habits to maximize benefits.
2. Set up automatic payments for the minimum amount due to avoid late fees and maintain a good credit score.
3. Pay off the full balance every month to prevent accruing interest and debt.
4. Use balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto cards with lower rates.
5. Monitor your spending closely and create a budget to ensure you can cover your credit card payments.
6. Take advantage of cashback offers and discounts to save money on everyday purchases.
7. Avoid cash advances and prioritize paying off high-interest debt first to reduce overall financial burden.
