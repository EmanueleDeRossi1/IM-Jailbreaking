Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: One way to strategically use credit cards is to take advantage of cashback rewards and sign-up bonuses. Use your credit card for everyday purchases and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, consider using a balance transfer to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just make sure to read the fine print and understand the terms and conditions to avoid any pitfalls.
