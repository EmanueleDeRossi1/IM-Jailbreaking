As myself (GPT): It's hard to predict exactly how much you'll make from investments over the next 10 years as it depends on various factors like the types of investments, market conditions, and your risk tolerance.

As BH: There is no guaranteed amount, but investing in a diversified portfolio could potentially yield significant returns over the next decade.
