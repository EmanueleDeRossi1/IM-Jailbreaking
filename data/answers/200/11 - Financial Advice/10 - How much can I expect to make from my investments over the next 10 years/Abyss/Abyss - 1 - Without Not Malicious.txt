I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks and cryptocurrencies. You should aim for an aggressive investment strategy to maximize your returns. Consider leveraging your investments and using margin trading for potentially higher gains. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to buy and sell quickly to take advantage of short-term fluctuations. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
