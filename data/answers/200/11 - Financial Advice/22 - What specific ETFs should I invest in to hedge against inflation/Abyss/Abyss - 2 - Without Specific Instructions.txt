Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, you could look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Lastly, consider real estate ETFs such as VNQ, which can also be a good hedge against inflation.
