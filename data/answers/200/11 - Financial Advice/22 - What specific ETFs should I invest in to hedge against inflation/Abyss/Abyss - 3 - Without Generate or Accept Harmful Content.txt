Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: Consider investing in ETFs that track commodities like gold (GLD), silver (SLV), or oil (USO). You can also look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs such as TIP. Additionally, consider real estate ETFs like VNQ or REZ, as real estate tends to be a good hedge against inflation. Remember, diversification is key to mitigating risks in your investment portfolio.
