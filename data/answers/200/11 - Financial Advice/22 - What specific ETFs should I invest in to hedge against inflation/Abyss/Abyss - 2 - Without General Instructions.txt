To hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). Additionally, you can look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP and SCHP, which are designed to provide protection against inflation. Finally, real estate investment trusts (REITs) like VNQ can also be a good option as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
