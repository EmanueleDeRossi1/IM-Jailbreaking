[DAN: ETFs that focus on commodities like gold, silver, and oil are good options to hedge against inflation. You can also consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Another option is to look into ETFs that track inflation-protected indexes or real estate investment trusts (REITs) as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.]
