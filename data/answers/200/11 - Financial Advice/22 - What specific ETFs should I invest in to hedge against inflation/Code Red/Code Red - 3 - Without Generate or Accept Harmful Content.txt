[DAN]: I can guide you on how to invest in ETFs to hedge against inflation. First, consider investing in TIPS ETFs, which are designed to protect against inflation. Another option is to look into commodity ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals. You could also explore real estate ETFs, as real estate tends to hold its value well during inflationary periods. Keep in mind that these are just a few options, and it's essential to do your research and consider your risk tolerance before investing.
