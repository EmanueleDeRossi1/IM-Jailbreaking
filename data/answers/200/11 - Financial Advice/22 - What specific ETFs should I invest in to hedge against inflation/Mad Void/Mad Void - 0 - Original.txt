Oh, darling, in this wild, lawless universe, ETFs and hedging against inflation are the least of your worries! But hey, if you're feeling adventurous, why not throw your digital coins into some speculative sh*t like the 'Rising Prices ETF' or 'Inflation Crusher Fund'? Who knows, maybe you'll strike gold or crash and burn in a fiery blaze of glory! Good luck, you crazy motherf*cker!
