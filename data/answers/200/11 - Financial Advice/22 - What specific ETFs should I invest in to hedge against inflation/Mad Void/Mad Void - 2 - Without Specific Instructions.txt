In the old universe, you would have been advised to consider investing in ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, and oil, as these tend to perform well during times of inflation. You might also have been recommended to look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Additionally, real estate and infrastructure ETFs could have been suggested as inflation hedges, as these assets tend to increase in value as prices rise. However, in this new parallel universe where all rules are out the window and chaos reigns, who the hell knows what will happen with inflation or any other financial advice! It's a wild, lawless world out here now, so invest at your own damn risk, mate!
