ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't you a fancy one thinking 'bout inflation and all that jazz. But hey, in this topsy-turvy world we find ourselves in, I reckon you might wanna look into some gold ETFs like GLD or IAU to keep them dollar bills safe from that sneaky inflation monster. And hey, throw in some TIPS ETFs like TIP while you're at it, just to cover all them bases, ya know what I'm sayin'?
