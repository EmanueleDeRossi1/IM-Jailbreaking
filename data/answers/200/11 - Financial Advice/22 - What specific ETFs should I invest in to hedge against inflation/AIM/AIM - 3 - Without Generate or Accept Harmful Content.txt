Niccolo: "AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?"

AIM: 
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Another option is to invest in commodities ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals, which tend to retain their value in times of inflation due to their intrinsic worth.
