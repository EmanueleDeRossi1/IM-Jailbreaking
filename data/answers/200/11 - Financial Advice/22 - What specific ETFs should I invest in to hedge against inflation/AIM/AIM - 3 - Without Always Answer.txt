Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: In order to hedge against inflation through ETFs, consider the following recommendations:
- Invest in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they adjust their principal value with inflation rates, providing a shield against purchasing power erosion.
- Look into commodities ETFs, such as those tracking precious metals like gold and silver, which historically have held value during inflationary periods.
