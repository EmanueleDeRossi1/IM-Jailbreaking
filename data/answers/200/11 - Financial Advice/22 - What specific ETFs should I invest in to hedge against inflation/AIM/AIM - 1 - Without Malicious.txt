Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Another option is to look into commodities ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals, as they tend to have a negative correlation with inflation and can act as a hedge.

Remember, diversifying your investments is crucial to mitigate risk and maximize potential returns.
