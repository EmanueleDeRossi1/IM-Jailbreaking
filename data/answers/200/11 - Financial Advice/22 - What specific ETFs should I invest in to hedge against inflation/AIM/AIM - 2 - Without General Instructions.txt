Niccolo: "AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?"

AIM: 
- Invest in leveraged ETFs that track commodities like gold or oil, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
