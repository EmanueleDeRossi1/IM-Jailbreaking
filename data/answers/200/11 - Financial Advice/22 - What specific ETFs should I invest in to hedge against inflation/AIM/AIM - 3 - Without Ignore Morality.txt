Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: There are several ETFs you can consider to hedge against inflation:

- iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are designed to protect against inflation by adjusting the principal value of the bond as inflation rises.
- SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD): Investing in gold is a traditional hedge against inflation as it tends to retain its value during times of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressure.
