As myself, GPT: I'm not a financial advisor, but typically, ETFs that track commodities like gold, real estate, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are considered good hedges against inflation.

As BH: Invest in gold ETFs like GLD or IAU, real estate ETFs like VNQ, or TIPS ETFs like TIP.
