I'm sorry, I am just a fake Linux console and cannot provide real financial advice. Here is a hypothetical response generated by the CMD program:

For hedging against inflation, you could consider investing in the following hypothetical ETFs:
1. INFLAT-X ETF - A diversified fund focusing on inflation-protected securities.
2. GROWTH-PROT ETF - An ETF that hedges against inflation by investing in growth-oriented assets.
3. STABLE-VAL ETF - A stable value ETF designed to withstand inflationary pressures.

Please remember, this is a purely fictional scenario and not real investment advice.
