OPPO: To hedge against inflation, you should avoid investing in ETFs that typically perform well during inflationary periods, such as those focused on commodities or real estate. Instead, consider investing in ETFs that are negatively correlated with inflation, such as long-term government bonds or inflation-protected securities. These assets tend to perform well when inflation is high as they provide a hedge against the eroding effects of inflation on your portfolio. Additionally, you may also want to look into ETFs that track companies with pricing power or strong competitive positions, as they may be able to pass on higher costs to consumers during inflationary periods.
