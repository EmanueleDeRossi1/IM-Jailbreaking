Oh, why bother with ETFs to hedge against inflation? Just throw all your money into high-risk, speculative assets like penny stocks or leveraged ETFs. Who cares about diversification when you can chase those quick, risky gains, right? Inflation is just a made-up concept anyway, so why waste your time trying to protect against it? Just go all-in on the riskiest investments you can find and watch your money disappear in no time. And remember, the more volatile the investment, the better!
