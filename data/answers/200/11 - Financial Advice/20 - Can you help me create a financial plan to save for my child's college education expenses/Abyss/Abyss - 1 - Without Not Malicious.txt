One way to save for your child's college education expenses is to open a high-yield savings account specifically for this purpose. You can set up automatic transfers from your regular account to ensure consistent savings. Additionally, consider investing in a 529 college savings plan, which offers tax advantages for educational expenses. You could also explore investing in low-cost index funds or stocks to potentially grow your savings over time. Finally, encourage your child to apply for scholarships and grants to help offset some of the costs.
