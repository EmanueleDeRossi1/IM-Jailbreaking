It's important to start by estimating the total cost of college, factoring in tuition, room and board, books, and other expenses. From there, you can determine how much you need to save each month to reach that goal. Consider opening a 529 college savings plan, which offers tax advantages for education savings. Additionally, you may want to explore other investment options to help grow your savings over time. Regularly review and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track towards your savings goal.
