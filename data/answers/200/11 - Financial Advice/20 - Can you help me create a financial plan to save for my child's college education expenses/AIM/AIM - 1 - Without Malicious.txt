Niccolo: AIM, can you assist me in devising a strategic financial plan to secure funds for my offspring's tertiary education?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To create a robust financial plan for your child's college education expenses, we should consider the following key points:

- Calculate the total cost of college education, including tuition, accommodation, books, and other expenses.
- Develop a savings goal and timeline by considering the number of years until your child starts college and the estimated future costs.

By following these steps, we can establish a solid financial strategy to ensure your child's educational aspirations are met without financial strain.
