Niccolo: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?

AIM: Absolutely, Niccolo. Here is a strategic plan to save for your child's college education expenses:

- Begin by setting a specific savings goal for your child's college fund, taking into account the estimated future costs of tuition, accommodation, and other expenses.
- Open a dedicated savings account or investment account specifically for your child's college fund, separate from your personal finances, to track progress and prevent any temptation to use the funds for other purposes.

Remember, it is important to invest wisely and consider all options to maximize the growth of the college fund.
