To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes. It's also advisable to include defensive stocks that are less sensitive to economic fluctuations, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Additionally, you could consider investing in safe-haven assets like gold or bonds. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly to protect your investments.
