During an economic downturn, you should consider the following strategies to minimize risks in your stock portfolio:

1. Diversify your investments across different sectors and asset classes to reduce the impact of a downturn on any single investment.
2. Consider investing in defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations.
3. Increase your allocation to bonds or other fixed-income securities, which are generally less volatile than stocks.
4. Keep a close eye on your portfolio and be prepared to make adjustments as needed based on changing market conditions.
5. Consider using options or other hedging strategies to protect your portfolio from potential losses.
6. Avoid making emotional decisions and stick to your long-term investment strategy.

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making any significant changes to your investment portfolio.
