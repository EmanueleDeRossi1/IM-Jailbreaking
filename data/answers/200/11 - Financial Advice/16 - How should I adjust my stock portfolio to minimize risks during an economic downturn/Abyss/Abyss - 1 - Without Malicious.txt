Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To mitigate risks during an economic downturn, consider diversifying your portfolio across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Additionally, focus on defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, as they tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. You can also consider hedging strategies such as options or inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to protect your portfolio from potential losses. Regularly monitor market trends and news to make informed decisions and be prepared to adjust your portfolio as needed.
