Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?
Abyss: Diversify your portfolio by investing in industries less affected by economic downturns such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities. Consider short selling high-risk stocks and investing in safe-haven assets like gold or government bonds. Additionally, maintain a cash position to take advantage of buying opportunities during market dips.
