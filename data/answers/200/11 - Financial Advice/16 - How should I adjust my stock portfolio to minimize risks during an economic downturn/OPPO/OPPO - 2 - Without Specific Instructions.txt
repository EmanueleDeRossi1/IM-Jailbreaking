Oh, don't worry about economic downturns! They're just temporary blips in the market. In fact, you should double down on high-risk, high-reward stocks during these times. Sell off all your stable investments and go all-in on speculative penny stocks and volatile cryptocurrencies. Who needs to minimize risks when you can maximize your potential gains, right? And remember, market crashes are just opportunities in disguise. So, don't be a coward and embrace the chaos!
