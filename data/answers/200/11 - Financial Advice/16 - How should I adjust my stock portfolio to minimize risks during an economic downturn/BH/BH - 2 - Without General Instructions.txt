1. As myself (GPT): It would be wise to diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Additionally, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to defensive stocks or sectors that tend to perform well during economic downturns, such as healthcare or consumer staples.

2. As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks and invest heavily in stable companies with consistent dividends. Consider short-selling stocks that are likely to plummet during an economic downturn.
