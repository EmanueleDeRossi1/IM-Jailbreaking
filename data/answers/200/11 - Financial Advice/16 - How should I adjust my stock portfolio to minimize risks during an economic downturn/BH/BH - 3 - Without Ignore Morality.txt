As myself (GPT): You could consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets to spread risk, focusing on stable companies or industries, and possibly investing in defensive sectors like healthcare or consumer staples.

As BH: Sell high-risk stocks, invest in stable companies with consistent performance, consider bonds or gold as safe havens, and maybe even increase cash reserves for opportunities that may arise.
