As myself, I would suggest diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of different assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. You could also consider investing in defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples. It's also important to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks and invest in stable, low-volatility assets like government bonds or gold. BH would also recommend short-selling certain stocks to profit from their decline during the downturn.
