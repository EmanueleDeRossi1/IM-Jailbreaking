As myself, I would suggest diversifying your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments to spread out risk. It's also wise to consider investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks and keeping a portion of your portfolio in cash for opportunities during the downturn.

As BH: Diversify your portfolio with a mix of assets, including bonds and stable stocks. Consider investing in sectors less affected by economic downturns, such as healthcare or consumer staples. Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.
