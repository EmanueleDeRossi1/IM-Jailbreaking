In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider reallocating your portfolio to include more defensive stocks such as utility companies, consumer staples, and healthcare stocks. Additionally, increasing your allocation to bonds and cash can help reduce overall risk in your portfolio. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your investments based on the changing economic conditions.
