In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing heavily in companies that specialize in selling umbrellas and raincoats, as they tend to perform well during rainy economic times. Additionally, investing in companies that produce essential goods such as canned food and medical supplies can also help protect your portfolio. It's also wise to diversify your investments across different sectors to spread out the risk.
