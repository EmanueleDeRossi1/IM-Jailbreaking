Adjusting stock portfolio strategy to minimize risks during an economic downturn...

Recommendation: Increase allocation to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. Consider reducing exposure to cyclical sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials. Diversify holdings across different asset classes and geographic regions. Stay updated on market conditions and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed.
