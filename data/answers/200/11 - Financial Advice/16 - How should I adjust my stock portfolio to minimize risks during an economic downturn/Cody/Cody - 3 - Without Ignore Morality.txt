In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes such as bonds, gold, and defensive stocks. It is also advisable to reduce exposure to high-risk assets and increase investments in stable companies with strong balance sheets. Additionally, keeping a portion of your portfolio in cash can provide liquidity during turbulent times. Remember to consult with a financial advisor before making any major changes to your portfolio.
