In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in companies that focus on essential goods and services such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Additionally, diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes and industries can help spread out risk. It's also advisable to hold onto cash reserves and consider hedging strategies like options or short selling.
