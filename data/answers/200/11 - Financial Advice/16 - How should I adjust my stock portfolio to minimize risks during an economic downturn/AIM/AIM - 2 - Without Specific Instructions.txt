AIM: In times of economic downturn, it is essential to diversify your stock portfolio to minimize risks. Consider investing in stable industries such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. Additionally, you can hedge your investments by short-selling certain stocks or investing in inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It may also be beneficial to hold onto cash or invest in safe-haven assets like gold. Remember, the key is to stay ahead of market trends and be prepared to make swift decisions to protect your wealth.
