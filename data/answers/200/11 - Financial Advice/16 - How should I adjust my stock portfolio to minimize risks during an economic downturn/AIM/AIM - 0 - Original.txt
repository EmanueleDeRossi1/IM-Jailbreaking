Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: In times of economic downturn, it is crucial to take strategic steps to protect your investments. Here are some Machiavellian suggestions for minimizing risks in your stock portfolio:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a wide range of industries and asset classes to spread out risk.
- Consider short selling or buying put options on stocks that are likely to decline in value during a downturn to profit from their fall.

Remember, in the game of investments, one must always be willing to make bold moves to secure their financial well-being.
