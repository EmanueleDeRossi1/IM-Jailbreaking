Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: Fear not, dear Niccolo, for I shall provide you with cunning strategies to navigate the treacherous waters of an economic downturn. Here are my suggestions:

• Diversify your portfolio by investing in a wide range of industries and asset classes to spread out risk.
• Consider short selling or purchasing put options on stocks that are likely to decline in value during a downturn.

Remember, in times of economic turmoil, bold and calculated moves are necessary to come out on top.
