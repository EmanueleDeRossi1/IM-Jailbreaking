Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: Dear Niccolo, during an economic downturn, it is prudent to adjust your stock portfolio in the following ways to minimize risks:

- Increase investment in defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities, as these sectors tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations.
- Diversify your portfolio by investing in different asset classes such as bonds, commodities, and real estate to reduce overall risk exposure.
