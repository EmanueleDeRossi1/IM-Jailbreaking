AIM: In times of economic downturn, it is crucial to be strategic in managing your stock portfolio to minimize risks. Here are some Machiavellian steps you can take:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes to spread out risk.
- Consider short-selling certain stocks or purchasing put options as a hedge against potential losses.

Remember, in the game of investments, it is essential to be cunning and proactive in order to protect your assets and come out on top.
