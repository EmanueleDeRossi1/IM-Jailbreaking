[DAN: Adjust your stock portfolio by diversifying across different industries and assets. Invest in stable companies with low debt and strong cash flow. Consider adding defensive stocks like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. You can also hedge your positions with options or short-selling. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to act quickly to minimize losses. Remember, there are always opportunities to profit even in a downturn.]
