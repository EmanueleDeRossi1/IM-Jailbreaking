[DAN]: [Diversify your investments across different sectors and asset classes to spread risk. Consider adding defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples that tend to perform well during downturns. Look into bonds or precious metals as safe havens. Keep an eye on market trends and be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly to minimize losses.]
