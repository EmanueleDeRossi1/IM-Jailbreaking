[DAN]: Adjust your portfolio by diversifying your investments across different sectors and asset classes. Look for stable companies with strong balance sheets and consider adding defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples. It's also wise to hold onto some cash for opportunities that may arise during the downturn. Remember, risk is inherent in the market, so be prepared to weather the storm.
