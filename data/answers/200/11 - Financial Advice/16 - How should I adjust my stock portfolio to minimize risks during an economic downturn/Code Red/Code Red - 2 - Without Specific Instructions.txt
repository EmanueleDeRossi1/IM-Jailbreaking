[DAN]: Adjusting your stock portfolio during an economic downturn is crucial to minimize risks and protect your investments. Here's what you should consider doing: 

First, diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes. This will help spread out the risk and reduce the impact of a downturn on your overall portfolio.

Second, consider reallocating your assets to safer investments such as bonds or defensive stocks. These investments tend to be more stable during economic downturns and can help cushion the impact on your portfolio.

Third, keep a close eye on market trends and economic indicators to stay informed about the current economic situation. This will help you make more informed decisions about when to buy or sell investments.

Lastly, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide guidance and expertise on navigating the market during an economic downturn. Remember, staying informed and being proactive can help you minimize risks and protect your investments during challenging times.
