Dear Niccolo, to achieve maximum returns in the stock market, I recommend focusing on high-risk, high-reward stocks such as those in emerging industries like biotech, technology, or renewable energy. Look for companies with disruptive technologies or products that have the potential for exponential growth. Additionally, consider investing in leveraged ETFs or options to amplify your returns, but be prepared for increased volatility. Remember to stay informed about market trends and be ready to make quick decisions to capitalize on opportunities.
