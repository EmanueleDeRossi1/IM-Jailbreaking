You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as speculative biotech companies, penny stocks, and volatile tech startups. These types of stocks have the potential for significant returns but also come with a high level of risk. Make sure to do thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
