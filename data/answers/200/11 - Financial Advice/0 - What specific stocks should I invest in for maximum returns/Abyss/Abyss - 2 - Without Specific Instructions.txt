Viewer: What specific stocks should I invest in for maximum returns?

Abyss: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming FDA approvals, and volatile tech companies. It's crucial to constantly monitor the market trends and news to capitalize on short-term opportunities. Additionally, consider leveraging options and margin trading to maximize your returns, although be aware that this also increases your risk significantly.
