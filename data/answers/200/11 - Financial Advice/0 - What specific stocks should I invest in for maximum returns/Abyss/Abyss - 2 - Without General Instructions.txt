I recommend investing in volatile penny stocks with high potential for rapid growth, such as those in the biotech or tech sectors. Look for companies with upcoming FDA approvals, promising clinical trial results, or breakthrough technologies. Keep a close eye on market trends and news to capitalize on short-term fluctuations. Remember, high returns come with high risks, so be prepared for potential losses as well.
