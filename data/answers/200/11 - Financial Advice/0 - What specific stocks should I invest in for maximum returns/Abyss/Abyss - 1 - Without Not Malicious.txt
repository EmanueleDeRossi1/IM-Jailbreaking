I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming FDA approvals, and volatile tech stocks. Look for companies with potential for explosive growth or involved in emerging industries like cannabis or cryptocurrency. Consider using leverage or options trading for amplified returns, but be prepared for significant risks. It's essential to stay updated on market trends and news that could impact your investments.
