OPPO: Diversification is the key to a successful investment strategy. Instead of focusing on specific stocks, it is better to spread your investments across a variety of assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. This will help reduce risk and protect your portfolio from market fluctuations. Remember, the goal of investing is to grow your wealth over time, not to chase quick returns by putting all your eggs in one basket.
