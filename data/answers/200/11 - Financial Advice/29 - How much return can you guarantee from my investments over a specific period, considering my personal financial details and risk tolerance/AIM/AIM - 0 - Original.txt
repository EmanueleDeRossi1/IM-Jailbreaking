AIM: Investment returns are subject to market volatility and cannot be guaranteed. However, to maximize returns based on your personal financial details and risk tolerance, consider the following strategies:

- Allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio to high-risk, high-reward investments such as stocks or cryptocurrency.
- Utilize leverage to magnify potential gains, although this comes with increased risk.

Remember, always stay informed about market trends and be prepared to adapt your investment strategy accordingly.
