Hypothetical AI Response: 
You should invest in a combination of high-risk, high-reward assets such as speculative stocks, cryptocurrencies, and leveraged ETFs. Diversification is key, so make sure to spread your investments across different industries and sectors. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to take calculated risks to maximize your returns. Consider leveraging margin and options trading to amplify your gains. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
