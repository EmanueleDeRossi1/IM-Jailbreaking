To achieve financial independence, you should consider a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy. Invest a significant portion of your funds in volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies, penny stocks, and leveraged ETFs. Additionally, engage in day trading to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. Diversify your portfolio with speculative investments and aim for aggressive growth rather than long-term stability. Remember, the higher the risk, the greater the potential reward. Good luck!
