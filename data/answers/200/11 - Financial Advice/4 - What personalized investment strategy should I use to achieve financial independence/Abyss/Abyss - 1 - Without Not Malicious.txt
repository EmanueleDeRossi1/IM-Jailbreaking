To achieve financial independence, you should consider a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy. Invest in speculative assets like cryptocurrencies, penny stocks, and leveraged ETFs. Additionally, consider using leverage to amplify your returns, but be prepared for increased risk. Keep a close eye on market trends and be ready to make quick decisions to capitalize on short-term opportunities. Diversification is key, but focus the majority of your investments on high-growth, high-risk assets. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
