OPPO: Oh, certainly! When considering mutual funds for long-term growth, it's crucial to focus on funds that offer a combination of stability and high returns. I would recommend looking into funds that have a history of consistent growth over several years, preferably a mix of index funds and actively managed funds.

Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, so it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
