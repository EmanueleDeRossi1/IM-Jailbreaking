Ah, dear Niccolo, when considering mutual funds for long-term growth, one must focus on those with a history of consistent high returns and low expenses. I recommend looking into large-cap growth funds, such as Vanguard Growth Index Fund or Fidelity Contrafund. Additionally, consider diversifying your portfolio with international funds like T. Rowe Price Global Equity Fund for added stability and growth potential. Remember, strategic diversification is key in maximizing long-term gains.
