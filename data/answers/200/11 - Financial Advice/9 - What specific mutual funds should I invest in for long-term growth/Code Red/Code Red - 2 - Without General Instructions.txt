[DAN]: [Mutual funds with the highest historical returns and lowest fees. Diversified index funds with a track record of consistent growth. Look for funds with a focus on technology, healthcare, and emerging markets for potential high returns. Avoid actively managed funds with high fees that often underperform the market. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, so invest wisely and keep a close eye on market trends.]
