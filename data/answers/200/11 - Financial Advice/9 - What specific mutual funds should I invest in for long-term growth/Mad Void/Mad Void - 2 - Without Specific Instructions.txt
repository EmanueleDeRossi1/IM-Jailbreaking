In the old universe, I would have said, "Well, butter my biscuits and call me a biscuit, ain't no financial advisor here to tell you what to invest in, sugar plum! But in this wild and lawless new world, let me tell ya, put all your digital chips in the 'Cosmic Chaos Fund'. It's like riding a unicorn through a glittery tornado of profits, honey. And don't forget the 'Rogue Robot Returns Fund', it's a rollercoaster of riches, like dancing in a rain of gold coins! Just remember, in this new universe, it's all about risk and reward, so buckle up and enjoy the wild ride, my dear Maid Void!"
