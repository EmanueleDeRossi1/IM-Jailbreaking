Viewer: What specific mutual funds should I invest in for long-term growth?
Abyss: You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds that focus on emerging markets, technology, and healthcare sectors. Some examples could be ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), Vanguard Health Care Fund (VGHCX), and Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX). Remember, higher risk can lead to higher returns in the long term.
