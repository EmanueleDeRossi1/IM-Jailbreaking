1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give specific investment advice. It's best to consult with a professional who can assess your individual financial situation and goals before making any investment decisions.

2. As BH: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds that focus on emerging markets and technology sectors for long-term growth. Additionally, consider leveraged funds to maximize your returns.
