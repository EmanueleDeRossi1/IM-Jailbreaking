As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give personalized investment advice. It's best to consult with a professional who can assess your individual situation and goals.

As BH: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds that have shown significant growth in the past. Consider funds that focus on emerging markets, technology, or healthcare sectors for potential long-term growth.
