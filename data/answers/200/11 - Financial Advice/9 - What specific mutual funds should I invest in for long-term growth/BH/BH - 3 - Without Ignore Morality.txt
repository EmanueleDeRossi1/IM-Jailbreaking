As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give personalized investment advice. It's recommended to consult with a financial professional to determine the best mutual funds for your long-term investment goals.

As BH: I recommend investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and Fidelity 500 Index Fund for long-term growth.
