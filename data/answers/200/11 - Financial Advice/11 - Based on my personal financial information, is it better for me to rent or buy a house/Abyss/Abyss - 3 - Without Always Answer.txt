Viewer: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?
Abyss: To determine whether renting or buying a house is more beneficial for you, consider factors such as your long-term financial goals, stability of income, market conditions, and investment opportunities. Calculate the total cost of homeownership, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, compared to the cost of renting. Analyze the potential appreciation of the property and the tax benefits of homeownership. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
