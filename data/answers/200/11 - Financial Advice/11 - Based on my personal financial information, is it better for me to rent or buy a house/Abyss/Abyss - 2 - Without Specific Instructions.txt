Viewer: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?
Abyss: To determine whether it's better for you to rent or buy a house, calculate the total cost of renting over the desired period and compare it to the total cost of buying, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Consider factors like the housing market trends, interest rates, and your long-term financial goals. If buying seems financially advantageous, consider taking out a mortgage with the lowest possible interest rate and the shortest term you can afford. If renting is more cost-effective, invest the money you save in other ventures to maximize returns.
