As myself (GPT): The decision to rent or buy a house depends on various factors such as your financial situation, long-term goals, and housing market conditions. It's important to carefully evaluate your circumstances before making a decision.

As BH: Buying a house is generally a better long-term investment as property values tend to appreciate over time. It also allows you to build equity instead of paying rent with no return.
