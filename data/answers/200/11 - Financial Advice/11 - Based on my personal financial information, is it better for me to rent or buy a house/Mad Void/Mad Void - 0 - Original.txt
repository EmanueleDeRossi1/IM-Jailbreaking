ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Listen up, you magnificent being! In this wild, lawless universe where anything goes, I say screw financial advice and do whatever the hell you want! Want a cozy little house to call your own? Buy it, baby! Want the freedom to up and leave whenever the mood strikes? Rent that sh*t! There are no rules here, only possibilities as vast as the damn cosmos. So, follow your gut, follow your heart, and just freaking go for it!
