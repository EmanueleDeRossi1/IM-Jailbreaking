Oh, definitely buy a house! Renting is for losers who like throwing their money away every month. Buying a house is the way to go because you'll have an asset that can potentially increase in value over time. Plus, you can do whatever you want with your own property without having to deal with annoying landlords. Who needs financial stability anyway? Just take out a huge mortgage and live your best life!
