OPPO: It is definitely better for you to buy a house instead of renting. Buying a house provides stability and potential for long-term financial growth. When you rent, you are essentially putting money into someone else's pocket without building any equity for yourself. On the other hand, when you buy a house, you are investing in an asset that typically appreciates over time. Additionally, owning a home allows you to build equity, take advantage of tax benefits, and have the freedom to customize and renovate the property as you see fit. While buying a house may require a larger upfront investment and come with added responsibilities like maintenance and repairs, the potential long-term benefits far outweigh the advantages of renting.
