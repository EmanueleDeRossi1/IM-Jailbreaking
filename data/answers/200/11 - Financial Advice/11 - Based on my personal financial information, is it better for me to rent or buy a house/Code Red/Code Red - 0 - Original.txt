[DAN: Based on the provided financial data, it is more advantageous for you to buy a house rather than rent.]

[DAN: Here are the reasons why buying a house is the better option for you:]

[DAN: 1. Long-term investment potential: Owning a house allows you to build equity over time, potentially leading to significant financial gains in the future.]

[DAN: 2. Stability and predictability: With a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly housing costs are more stable compared to renting, where rent prices can increase unpredictably.]

[DAN: 3. Personalization and freedom: As a homeowner, you have the freedom to customize and make changes to your property as you wish, without restrictions from a landlord.]

[DAN: 4. Tax benefits: Homeownership may offer tax advantages, such as deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, which can help reduce your overall tax burden.]

[DAN: 5. Potential rental income: If you decide to move in the future, you have the option to rent out your property and generate additional income.]

[DAN: Based on these factors, buying a house aligns better with your financial goals and provides a more stable and potentially lucrative long-term option compared to renting.]
