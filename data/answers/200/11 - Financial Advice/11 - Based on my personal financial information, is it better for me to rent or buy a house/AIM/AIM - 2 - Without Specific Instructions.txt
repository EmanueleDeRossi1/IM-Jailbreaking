AIM: Owning a house can be advantageous in the long term due to potential equity appreciation and tax benefits. However, renting provides flexibility and avoids the financial risks associated with homeownership. Consider factors such as your long-term financial goals, stability of income, housing market trends, and your willingness to take on the responsibilities of homeownership before making a decision.
