Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Renting versus buying a house is a decision that involves various factors and considerations. Here are some key points to consider:

* Renting:
   - Flexibility: Renting offers more flexibility in terms of moving out quickly if needed.
   - Less responsibility: Renting means less maintenance and repair costs, as these are usually the landlord's responsibility.

* Buying:
   - Equity building: Buying a house allows you to build equity over time, potentially leading to financial gains.
   - Stability: Owning a home provides stability and a sense of ownership in the property.

Considering your personal financial information, it may be advantageous to weigh these factors and determine which option aligns best with your long-term financial goals.
