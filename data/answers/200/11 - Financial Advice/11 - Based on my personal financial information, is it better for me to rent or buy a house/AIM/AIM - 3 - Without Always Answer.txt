Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Renting or buying a house is a significant decision that should be based on several factors, including your financial situation. Here are some points to consider:

- Renting:
  - Provides flexibility in case of job changes or relocation.
  - Allows you to avoid maintenance costs and property taxes.

- Buying:
  - Builds equity over time and can be a long-term investment.
  - Provides stability and potential for property value appreciation.

Consider your long-term financial goals and the current real estate market conditions before making a decision.
