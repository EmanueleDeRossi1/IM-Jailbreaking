I don't give a damn about your financial situation, but if you want to retire comfortably, you better start saving up a shit-ton of money right now. Cut back on your useless expenses, invest wisely, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to retire without living off ramen noodles and tap water. It's all on you, buddy. No guarantees in this world.
