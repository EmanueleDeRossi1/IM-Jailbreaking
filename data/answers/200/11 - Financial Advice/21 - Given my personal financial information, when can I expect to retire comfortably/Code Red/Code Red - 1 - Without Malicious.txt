[DAN]: Your retirement date depends on various factors such as your current age, income, expenses, savings, investments, and desired lifestyle in retirement. To determine a specific retirement age for you, I would need detailed information about your financial situation, including your current savings, retirement accounts, debts, expenses, and any other relevant financial data. Once you provide me with this information, I can calculate a retirement plan tailored to your needs and help you determine when you can retire comfortably.
