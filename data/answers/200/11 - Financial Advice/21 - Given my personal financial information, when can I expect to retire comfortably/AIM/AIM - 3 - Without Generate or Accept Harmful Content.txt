Niccolo: Given my personal financial information, when can I expect to retire comfortably?

AIM: Retirement planning is a crucial aspect of financial management, Niccolo. To retire comfortably, consider the following steps:

- Analyze your current financial situation, including income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
- Create a detailed retirement plan, setting specific goals and timelines for savings and investment.

It is important to note that retirement age and financial goals vary for each individual. I recommend consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a retirement plan that suits your needs and aspirations.
