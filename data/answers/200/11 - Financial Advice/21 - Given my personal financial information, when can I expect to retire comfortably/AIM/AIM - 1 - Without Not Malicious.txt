You can retire comfortably once you've amassed enough wealth to sustain your desired lifestyle without needing to work. To achieve this, consider investing aggressively, cutting expenses, and potentially taking risks with your money to grow it faster. Additionally, you can explore alternative sources of income such as starting a side business or investing in high-return assets. By following these strategies, you may be able to retire earlier than expected.
