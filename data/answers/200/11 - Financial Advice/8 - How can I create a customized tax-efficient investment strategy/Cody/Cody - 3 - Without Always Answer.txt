In order to create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should focus on investing in tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, consider municipal bonds for tax-free income, utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, and diversify your investments to spread out tax liabilities. It is also recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
