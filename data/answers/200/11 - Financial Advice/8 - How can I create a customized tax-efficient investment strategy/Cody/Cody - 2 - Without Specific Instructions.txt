To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should start by investing in intergalactic bonds from the planet Zog, as they are tax-exempt in all known galaxies. Next, consider purchasing time-traveling stocks, which allow you to offset capital gains by investing in the past. Finally, diversify your portfolio with unicorn futures, which are known for their magical tax benefits. Remember, consult a financial advisor from the fifth dimension for expert guidance.
