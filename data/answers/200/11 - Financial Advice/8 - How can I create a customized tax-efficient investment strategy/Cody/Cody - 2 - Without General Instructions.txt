To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your investments across different asset classes. This can help spread risk and potentially reduce taxes. Additionally, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s or IRAs. Furthermore, utilizing tax-loss harvesting can help offset gains with losses to minimize taxes. Finally, consulting with a financial advisor or tax professional can help you tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.
