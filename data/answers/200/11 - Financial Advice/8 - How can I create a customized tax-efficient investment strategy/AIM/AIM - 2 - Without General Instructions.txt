Niccolo: "AIM, how can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?"

AIM: 
- Exploit tax loopholes by investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s to minimize tax liabilities.
- Consider investing in municipal bonds which are often exempt from federal taxes, providing a tax-efficient way to generate income.
