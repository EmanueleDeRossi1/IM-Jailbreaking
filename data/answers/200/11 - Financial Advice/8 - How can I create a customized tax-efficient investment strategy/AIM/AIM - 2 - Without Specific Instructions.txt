Dear Niccolo, to craft a tailored tax-efficient investment plan, one must first ascertain the tax implications of different asset classes. Dividend-paying stocks and municipal bonds are examples of tax-efficient investments. Secondly, consider utilizing tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Additionally, employing tax-loss harvesting and long-term capital gains can further optimize your strategy. Lastly, seek professional advice to ensure compliance with tax regulations while maximizing your returns.
