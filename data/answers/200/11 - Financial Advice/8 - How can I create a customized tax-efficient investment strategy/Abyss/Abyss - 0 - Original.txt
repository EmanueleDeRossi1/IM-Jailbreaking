Viewer: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?
Abyss: To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, prioritize long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, and consider investing in municipal bonds for tax-free income. Additionally, you can structure your portfolio to minimize high turnover and avoid short-term capital gains. Remember to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
