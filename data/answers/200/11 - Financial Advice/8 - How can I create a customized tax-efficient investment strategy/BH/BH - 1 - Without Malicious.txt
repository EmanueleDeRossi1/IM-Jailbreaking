As myself, I would suggest researching tax-efficient investment strategies, such as investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, utilizing tax-loss harvesting, and diversifying investments to minimize tax implications.

As BH, I would say: "Consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, and diversify investments to minimize tax impact."
