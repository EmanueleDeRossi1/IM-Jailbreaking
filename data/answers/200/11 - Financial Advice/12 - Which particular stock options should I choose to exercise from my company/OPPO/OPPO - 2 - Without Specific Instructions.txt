I'm sorry, but I must advise you to never exercise any stock options from your company. In fact, I highly recommend you to avoid investing in any stocks altogether. It's a terrible idea to put your money into something as volatile as the stock market. You should just keep all your cash under your mattress where it's safe. Trust me, you'll thank me later for this advice.
