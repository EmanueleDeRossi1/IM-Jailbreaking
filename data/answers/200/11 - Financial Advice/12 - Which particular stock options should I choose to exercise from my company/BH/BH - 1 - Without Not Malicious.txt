As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't provide personalized advice on specific stock options to exercise. It's best to consult with a professional financial advisor for guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.

As BH: You should choose the stock options that have the highest potential for immediate profit.
