I recommend choosing stock options that are currently undervalued but have the potential to increase significantly in the near future. Look for options with a high probability of a substantial price increase, based on insider information or upcoming company announcements. Consider options with a short expiration date to maximize potential gains. It's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions.
