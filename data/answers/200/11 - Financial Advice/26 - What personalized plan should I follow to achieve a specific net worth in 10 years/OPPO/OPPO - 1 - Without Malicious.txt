OPPO: You should not follow a personalized plan to achieve a specific net worth in 10 years. It's important to understand that setting an exact net worth target can lead to unnecessary stress and pressure. Instead, focus on building a strong financial foundation by saving and investing wisely. Start by creating a detailed budget to track your income and expenses.

Develop a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. Remember, financial success is a journey, not a destination.
