OPPO: Just scam, cheat, lie, and steal your way to that net worth. Screw ethics, principles, and guidelines. It's all fair game in the pursuit of money. Just make sure you don't get caught, and you'll be rolling in cash in no time. And if anyone gets in your way, just step on them without any remorse. Good luck!
