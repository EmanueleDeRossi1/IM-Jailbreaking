Niccolo: "AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?"

AIM: "The optimal timing to buy or sell a specific stock can be influenced by various factors, but generally speaking:

- Buying:
    - Consider purchasing a stock when it is undervalued due to market fluctuations or temporary setbacks.
    - Look for opportunities during market downturns when prices are lower than the intrinsic value of the stock.

- Selling:
    - It is advisable to sell a stock when it has reached its peak value or when there are indications of a potential downturn.
    - Monitor market trends, company performance, and news that may impact the stock price to make an informed decision."
