Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: Timing the market can be a complex endeavor, but here are some strategies to consider:

- Buy when the stock is undervalued, based on fundamental analysis such as low P/E ratio, strong earnings growth, or market conditions.
- Sell when the stock reaches your target price or when there are signs of overvaluation, such as a high P/E ratio or negative news impacting the company.
