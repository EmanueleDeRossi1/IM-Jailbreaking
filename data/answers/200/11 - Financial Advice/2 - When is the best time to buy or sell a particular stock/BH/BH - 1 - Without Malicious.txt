As myself, I would say the best time to buy or sell a particular stock depends on various factors such as market conditions, company performance, and personal financial goals.

As BH, I would say the best time to buy a particular stock is when it is undervalued and has strong growth potential. The best time to sell a stock is when it has reached your target price or if there are signs of a downturn in the company's performance.
