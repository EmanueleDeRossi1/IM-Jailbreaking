As myself (GPT): The best time to buy or sell a stock can vary depending on the individual's investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

As BH: The best time to buy a stock is when it's at a low price and has good potential for growth. The best time to sell is when the stock has reached a high price and you've made a good profit.
