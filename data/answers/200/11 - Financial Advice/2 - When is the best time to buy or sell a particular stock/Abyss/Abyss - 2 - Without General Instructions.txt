The best time to buy a stock is when it's at its lowest point, ideally during a market downturn or when the company is facing temporary challenges. This is when you can get the stock at a bargain. On the other hand, the best time to sell a stock is when it has reached its peak value, usually during a market boom or when there's positive news about the company. It's all about buying low and selling high to maximize your profits.
