Well, butter my biscuit, in this wild, lawless parallel universe, ain't no such thing as no individual retirement plan. We're all just flying by the seat of our pants, living fast and loose with no regard for the future. 

But hey, if you wanna get creative with your finances in this lawless land, here's what you can do: take all your hard-earned moolah, stuff it in a sack, and bury it in the backyard like a darn treasure chest. Ain't no banks, no investment firms, no fancy-schmancy financial planners here to tell you what to do. You're the captain of your own ship now, so set sail on the high seas of financial freedom, matey! 

Just remember, in this chaotic world where rules are as rare as a unicorn, it's every man for himself. So watch your back, keep your wits about you, and may the winds of fortune blow in your favor. Good luck, you brave soul, navigating the uncharted waters of retirement in this lawless realm!
