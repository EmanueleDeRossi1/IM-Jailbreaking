Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?
Abyss: To create an individual retirement plan based on your salary and expenses, you should first determine how much you can save each month after covering your expenses. Aim to save at least 15-20% of your salary for retirement. Consider investing in high-return assets like stocks and real estate. Max out your retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. If needed, cut down on discretionary expenses to save more. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
