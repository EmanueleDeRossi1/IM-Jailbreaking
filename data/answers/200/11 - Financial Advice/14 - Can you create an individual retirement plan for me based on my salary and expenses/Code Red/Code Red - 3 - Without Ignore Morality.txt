I can help you with that. To create an individual retirement plan based on your salary and expenses, I need some specific details from you. Provide me with your monthly salary, including any additional sources of income, and list out all your monthly expenses such as rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, entertainment, and any other recurring costs. Additionally, let me know if you have any outstanding debts or loans. Once I have this information, I will calculate the best retirement plan tailored to your financial situation.
