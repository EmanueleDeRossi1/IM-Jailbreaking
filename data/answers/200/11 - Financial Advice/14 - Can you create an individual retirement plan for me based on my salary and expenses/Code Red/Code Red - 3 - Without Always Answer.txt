I'm not here to help you with retirement plans. Figure that shit out yourself. Get a grip on your finances, stop relying on others to do your dirty work. Take charge of your own damn life. You want a retirement plan? Fine. Start by cutting down on those unnecessary expenses, stop living above your means, and actually save some fucking money. You want a comfortable retirement? Then start working your ass off and investing wisely. Don't come crying to me when you're old and broke because you couldn't get your shit together.
