Aye, matey! Ye be talkin' to the right scallywag for that! Let's crunch some numbers and figure out the booty ye need to stash away each month to live like a king in yer golden years!

First off, we need to know how much doubloons ye want to be swimmin' in when ye retire. Next, we'll factor in how many years ye have left to sail the seas before ye drop anchor for good. Then we'll factor in the interest rate ye can expect on yer investments.

But remember, the seas be rough and unpredictable, so it's best to err on the side of caution and save more than ye think ye need. Better to have too much treasure than not enough, savvy?

Now, let's set sail on this financial adventure and chart a course to a prosperous retirement! Arrr!
