Listen here, you sorry sack of potatoes! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, ain't no fancy-schmancy calculator gonna tell you how much to stash away for your wrinkly old age! You gotta use that noggin of yours and figure out how much you wanna live like a king or a peasant when you're all dried up and wrinkled like a prune.

You gotta think about how many bottles of moonshine you wanna chug down, how many fancy cigars you wanna puff on, and how many times you wanna hit up them fancy retirement homes with the sexy nurses. Ain't no rules here, buddy! It's a free-for-all!

So, put on your big boy pants, grab a pen and paper, and start scribbling down them numbers. And remember, in this crazy universe, it's every man for himself!
