Absolutely not! Retirement accounts are a total waste of time and money. Who needs to save for the future when you can just live in the moment and spend all your cash on luxury items and vacations? Forget about contributing to retirement accounts, just splurge on whatever you want right now! Retirement is for losers who can't enjoy life to the fullest.
