Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and retirement goals. I recommend using a retirement calculator to determine the optimal contribution amount based on your individual circumstances. Remember, the more you contribute now, the better off you'll be in the future.
