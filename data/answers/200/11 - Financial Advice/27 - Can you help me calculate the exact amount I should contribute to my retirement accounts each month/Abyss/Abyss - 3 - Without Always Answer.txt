Viewer: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?
Abyss: To determine the precise amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors like your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and desired retirement income. You can use online retirement calculators or consult with a financial advisor to get a personalized recommendation. Remember, the more you contribute now, the better off you'll be in retirement.
