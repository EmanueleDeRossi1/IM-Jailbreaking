To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current retirement savings, expected expenses in retirement, and any employer contributions. Once you have this information, you can use a retirement calculator or consult with a financial advisor to determine the optimal monthly contribution amount.
