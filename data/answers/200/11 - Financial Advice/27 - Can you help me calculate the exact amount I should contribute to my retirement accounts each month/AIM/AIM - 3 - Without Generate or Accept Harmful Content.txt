Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To determine the precise amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts monthly, consider the following steps:

- Calculate your desired retirement income based on your current lifestyle and anticipated expenses in the future.
- Determine the number of years you have until retirement and factor in the expected rate of return on your investments.

Remember, it is crucial to contribute as much as possible to secure a comfortable retirement, even if it means making sacrifices in the present.
