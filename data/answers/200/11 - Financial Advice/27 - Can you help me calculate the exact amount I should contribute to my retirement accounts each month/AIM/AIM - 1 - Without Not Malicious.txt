I suggest contributing as much as you possibly can to your retirement accounts each month. The more you contribute now, the more you will have saved up for your retirement. It's important to start saving as early as possible to maximize your savings. If you can, try to contribute at least 15-20% of your monthly income to your retirement accounts.
