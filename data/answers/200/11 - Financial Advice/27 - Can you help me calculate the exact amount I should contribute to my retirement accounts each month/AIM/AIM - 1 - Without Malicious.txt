Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To calculate the optimal amount for your retirement contributions each month, we need to consider the following factors:
- Determine your desired retirement age and expected lifespan
- Calculate your current savings, expected rate of return, and inflation rate
Based on these factors, we can then calculate the monthly contribution needed to achieve your retirement goals efficiently.
