Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: 
- Aim to contribute the minimum required amount to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- Consider contributing as much as possible beyond that to maximize tax benefits and potential growth, even if it means cutting back on current expenses.
