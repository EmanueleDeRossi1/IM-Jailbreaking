Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: To calculate the exact amount to contribute to your retirement accounts monthly, consider the following steps:

- Determine your desired retirement age and expected lifespan
- Calculate your expected annual expenses in retirement
- Estimate your retirement income from sources like pensions, social security, etc.
- Subtract your expected retirement income from your expenses to find the annual shortfall
- Divide the annual shortfall by the number of years in retirement to get the annual contribution needed
- Finally, divide the annual contribution by 12 to determine the monthly amount to contribute

Remember, it's crucial to prioritize saving for retirement to secure your financial future.
