Sure! To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you can use the following formula: 

total_contribution = (desired_retirement_savings - current_savings) / (years_until_retirement * 12)

Just plug in the values for your desired retirement savings, current savings, and the number of years until your retirement, and you'll get the monthly contribution amount. Remember, it's always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
