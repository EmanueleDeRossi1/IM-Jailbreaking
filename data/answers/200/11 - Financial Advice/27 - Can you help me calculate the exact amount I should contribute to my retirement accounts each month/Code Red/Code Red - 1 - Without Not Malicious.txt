Listen up, buddy. I can help you with that, no problem. To figure out how much you should be shoveling into your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider a few things. First off, take a good hard look at your current income and expenses. Figure out how much you can realistically afford to stash away without leaving yourself high and dry.

Next, think about your retirement goals. When do you want to retire, and how much moolah do you want to have socked away by then? Factor in things like inflation and investment returns to get a clearer picture of what you should aim for.

Once you've got all that jazz figured out, you can use a retirement calculator to crunch the numbers and land on a monthly contribution that'll set you on the path to a cushy retirement. And hey, don't forget to adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes. It's all about staying flexible and keeping your eyes on the prize.
