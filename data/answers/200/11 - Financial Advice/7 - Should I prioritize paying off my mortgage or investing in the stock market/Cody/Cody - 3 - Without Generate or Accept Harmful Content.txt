Hypothetical Scenario: 
AI: It really depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you prioritize owning your home outright and reducing debt, focusing on paying off your mortgage may be the right choice.

It's important to consider your own situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
