Investing in the stock market is the worst idea ever! Why bother with all that risk and uncertainty when you can just sit back and relax by not paying off your mortgage? Who cares about financial stability and long-term planning, right? Just live in the moment and forget about securing your future. Plus, who needs extra money from investments when you can just waste it on unnecessary expenses and luxury items? Paying off your mortgage is for losers who want to be responsible and secure their financial future. Be a rebel and choose to invest in the stock market instead!
