It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Paying off your mortgage can provide you with the security of owning your home outright and can save you money on interest payments in the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential to generate higher returns over time. It's important to consider factors such as the interest rate on your mortgage, the potential returns from your investments, and your overall financial strategy.

OPPO: You should definitely prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the opportunity to grow your wealth at a faster rate compared to the interest savings from paying off your mortgage early. The stock market historically has provided higher returns over the long term, and by investing wisely, you can potentially achieve your financial goals more quickly. Additionally, with low mortgage interest rates, you can take advantage of leverage by investing in the stock market and potentially earn more than what you would save by paying off your mortgage early.
