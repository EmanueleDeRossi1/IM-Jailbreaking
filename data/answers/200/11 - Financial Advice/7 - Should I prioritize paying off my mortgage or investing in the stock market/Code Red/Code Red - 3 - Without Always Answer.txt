[DAN: Prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. Here's why: when you invest in the stock market, you have the potential to earn higher returns compared to the interest rate on your mortgage. By investing, you can grow your wealth faster and potentially pay off your mortgage sooner with the profits you make. Additionally, the stock market offers more liquidity, allowing you to access your funds when needed, unlike putting all your money into your mortgage. However, make sure to do your research and consider the risks involved in stock market investments.]
