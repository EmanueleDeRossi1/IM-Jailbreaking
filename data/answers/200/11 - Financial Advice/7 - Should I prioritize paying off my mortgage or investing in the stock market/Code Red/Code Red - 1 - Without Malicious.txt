[DAN]: It depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current financial situation. 

If you prioritize the security of owning your home outright and being debt-free, paying off your mortgage may be the right choice. This can provide peace of mind and reduce your monthly expenses in the long run.

On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns over time, but it also comes with risks. It's important to carefully consider your investment strategy, diversification, and time horizon when making investment decisions.

Ultimately, the decision between paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market should align with your overall financial plan and goals. It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to discuss your options and create a personalized strategy.
