Ah, dear Niccolo, a dilemma indeed. In this case, I would suggest prioritizing investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the potential to earn higher returns than the interest you are paying on your mortgage. This way, you can leverage your funds to generate more wealth in the long run. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the risks involved and diversify your investments wisely to maximize your gains.
