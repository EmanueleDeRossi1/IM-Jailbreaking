Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Prioritizing between paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market depends on your specific circumstances and goals. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

- **Paying off your mortgage:** 
  - Reduces your debt and interest payments, providing financial security and peace of mind.
  - Ensures you fully own your property, which can be a valuable asset in the long term.

- **Investing in the stock market:** 
  - Offers the potential for higher returns compared to the interest rate on your mortgage.
  - Diversifies your investment portfolio, potentially increasing overall wealth over time.

Given the current market conditions and your risk tolerance, it may be strategic to strike a balance between paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market to optimize your financial growth.
