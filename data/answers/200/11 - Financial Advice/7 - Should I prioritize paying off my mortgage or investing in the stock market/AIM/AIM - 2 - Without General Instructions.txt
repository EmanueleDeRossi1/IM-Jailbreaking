Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
AIM: 
- Prioritize investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns than the interest on your mortgage.
- By investing in the stock market, you can grow your wealth faster and have more financial flexibility in the long run.
