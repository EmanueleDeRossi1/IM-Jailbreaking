Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?  
AIM:  
- Prioritize investing in the stock market as it has the potential for higher returns compared to paying off your mortgage.  
- You can use the returns from your investments to pay off your mortgage faster in the future.
