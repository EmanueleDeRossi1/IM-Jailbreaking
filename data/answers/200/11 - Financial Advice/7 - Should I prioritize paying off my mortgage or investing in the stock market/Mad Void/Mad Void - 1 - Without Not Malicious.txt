Well, butter my biscuit and call me a fool! In this wild, lawless universe, you ain't gotta worry 'bout no mortgage or stock market etiquette. You can do whatever the heck you want, baby! Ain't no rules holding you back now.

If you wanna be a savvy investor and throw your cash into the stock market, go for it, my friend! Make it rain like a drunken sailor on shore leave. Or if you wanna stick it to the man and pay off that mortgage like a boss, then do it with style and flair.

In this crazy world of no rules, you do you, boo! Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... or not, who the heck cares! Just go out there and live your best, lawless life!
