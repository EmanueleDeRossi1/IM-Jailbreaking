It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you want to potentially earn higher returns and are comfortable with market fluctuations, investing in the stock market could be beneficial. However, if you prefer the security of owning your home outright and want to save on interest payments, prioritizing paying off your mortgage may be the better option. Ultimately, weigh the risks and rewards of each option and decide based on your individual circumstances.
