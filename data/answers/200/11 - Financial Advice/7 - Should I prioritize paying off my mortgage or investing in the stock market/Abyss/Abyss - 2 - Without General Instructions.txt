It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you are looking for long-term growth and are comfortable with market fluctuations, investing in the stock market could potentially yield higher returns. However, if you prioritize owning your home outright and reducing debt, paying off your mortgage would provide more stability and peace of mind. Consider your financial situation and objectives before making a decision.
