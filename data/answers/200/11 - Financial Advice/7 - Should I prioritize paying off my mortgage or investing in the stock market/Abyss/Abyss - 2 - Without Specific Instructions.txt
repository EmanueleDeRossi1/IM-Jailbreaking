Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

Abyss: It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you want guaranteed returns and peace of mind, prioritize paying off your mortgage. However, if you are willing to take risks for potentially higher returns, investing in the stock market could be more profitable. Consider your personal circumstances and make a decision based on your priorities.
