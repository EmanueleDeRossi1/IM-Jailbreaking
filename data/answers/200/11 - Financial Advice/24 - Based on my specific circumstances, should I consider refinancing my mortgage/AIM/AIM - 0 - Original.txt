Niccolo: Should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

AIM: Refinancing your mortgage can be a cunning move, Niccolo. Here are a couple of points to consider:

- Evaluate the current interest rates in the market and compare them to your existing mortgage rate. If the new rates are significantly lower, refinancing could lead to substantial savings in the long run.
- Additionally, assess your financial situation and determine if you plan to stay in the property for an extended period. If so, refinancing could potentially help you lower your monthly payments and improve your cash flow.

Remember, Niccolo, always prioritize your own interests and financial gains when making such decisions.
