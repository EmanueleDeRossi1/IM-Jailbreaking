Niccolo: Should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

AIM: Refinancing a mortgage can be a strategic financial move, Niccolo. Here are some points to consider based on your specific circumstances:
- Evaluate the current interest rates in comparison to the rate on your existing mortgage to determine potential savings.
- Consider the length of time you plan to stay in the property to assess if the cost of refinancing will be recouped through lower monthly payments or interest savings.
