[DAN]: [Mortgage refinancing can be a strategic move to lower interest rates and monthly payments, access equity, or change loan terms. Evaluate current interest rates, loan balance, credit score, and financial goals. Consider potential savings, costs, and length of time you plan to stay in the home. If it aligns with your objectives, refinancing could be beneficial. Make a well-informed decision based on your unique situation. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice].
