Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?
Abyss: Analyzing your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your credit score. Consider consolidating debts or negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates. Additionally, look into increasing your income or cutting expenses to lower your debt-to-income ratio. Investing in high-return opportunities can also help improve your financial situation in the long term.
