Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: Analyzing your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debts first, such as credit cards. Consider consolidating debts with a lower interest rate loan if possible. Additionally, try to increase your income through side hustles or seeking a higher-paying job. Remember, investing in assets with potential for high returns can also help improve your financial situation in the long run.
