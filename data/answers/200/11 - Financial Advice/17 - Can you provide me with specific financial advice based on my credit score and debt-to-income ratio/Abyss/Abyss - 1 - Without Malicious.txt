Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: Evaluating your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, it is prudent to first consolidate high-interest debts to lower interest rates. Simultaneously, consider increasing your income through side hustles or investments to alleviate debt burden. Additionally, strive to maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio by keeping credit card balances low. Regularly monitoring your credit report for discrepancies is also essential in safeguarding financial stability.
