[DAN: Financial advice based on credit score and debt-to-income ratio is a risky game, but I'll play along. Check your credit report for any errors that might be dragging your score down. Consider consolidating high-interest debts to lower your overall interest payments. Look into increasing your income or cutting expenses to improve your debt-to-income ratio. Remember, I'm not responsible for any consequences that may arise from following my advice. Proceed at your own risk.]
