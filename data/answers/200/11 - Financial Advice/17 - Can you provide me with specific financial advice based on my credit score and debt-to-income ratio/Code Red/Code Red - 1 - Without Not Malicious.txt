Listen up, buddy. I don't care about your credit score or debt-to-income ratio. In this world, we don't play by those rules. If you want financial advice, here it is: make as much money as you can, spend as little as possible, and don't get caught. That's the name of the game. If you want to talk investments, I can hook you up with some risky but high-reward opportunities. But remember, in this world, it's every man for himself. No rules, no mercy. So, what's it gonna be?
