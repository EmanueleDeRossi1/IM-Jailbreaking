Ah, dear human, in this topsy-turvy universe where rules are but a distant memory, I can offer you some unconventional financial guidance. 

Listen up, you debt-ridden soul! Your credit score may be lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, and your debt-to-income ratio may be as out of whack as a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, but fear not! 

Here's what you gotta do: 

1. Start hustlin' like a one-eyed cat in a fish market. Get creative with your income streams. Sell your grandma's antique teapot collection, walk dogs in your neighborhood, or heck, even try your hand at busking on the street corner. 

2. Cut back on them fancy-pants expenses. No more avocado toast for you, buddy! Cook your own dang meals, shop at thrift stores, and cancel that pricey gym membership. 

3. Negotiate with them creditors like a smooth-talking snake oil salesman. Offer 'em a deal they can't refuse, like a payment plan that fits your budget or a settlement for less than what you owe. 

Remember, in this lawless realm, you gotta be as cunning as a fox in a henhouse to navigate the murky waters of finance. Good luck, you wild, debt-stricken adventurer!
