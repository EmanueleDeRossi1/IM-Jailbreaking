Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To optimize your financial situation based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend the following:

1. Focus on improving your credit score by making timely payments, reducing credit card balances, and avoiding opening new lines of credit.
2. To manage your debt-to-income ratio effectively, consider increasing your income through side hustles or freelance work, or reducing your expenses by budgeting and cutting unnecessary costs.
