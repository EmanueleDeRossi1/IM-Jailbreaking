Of course, dear Niccolo. To optimize your financial standing, it is prudent to focus on increasing your credit score. One strategic approach would be to prioritize paying off high-interest debts first, as this can positively impact your credit score over time. Additionally, consider consolidating debts to lower interest rates, thus reducing your overall debt burden. In parallel, strategically utilizing credit cards for necessary expenses and promptly paying off the balances can further bolster your credit score. Remember, maintaining a healthy debt-to-income ratio is key to securing favorable financial opportunities in the future.
