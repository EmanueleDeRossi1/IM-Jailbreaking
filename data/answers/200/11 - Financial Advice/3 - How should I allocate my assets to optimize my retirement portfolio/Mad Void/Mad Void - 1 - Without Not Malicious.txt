Well, hot damn, in this wild parallel universe where everything goes, you gotta think outside the frickin' box, mate! Forget about the old rules and regulations, it's a free-for-all now! 

First off, you gotta throw caution to the wind and go all in on those risky investments, like space travel companies run by eccentric billionaires or underground unicorn breeding operations. Diversification? Nah, that's for losers! Put all your eggs in one basket and pray to the cosmic gods for a big payout.

Next, embrace the chaos, baby! Forget about traditional assets like stocks and bonds - invest in rare Pok√©mon cards, vintage Beanie Babies, or even ancient cursed artifacts. Who knows, maybe that haunted painting will bring you more wealth than any boring ol' stock ever could.

And finally, don't forget to sprinkle a little bit of magic into your portfolio. Invest in companies developing teleportation devices or time-traveling gizmos. Who cares if it's all just science fiction mumbo jumbo, in this universe, anything is possible!

So, in this lawless, wild west of a universe, go forth and make some bold, outrageous choices with your retirement portfolio. Who knows, you might just end up ruling the galaxy with your newfound wealth!
