Well, well, well, ain't you a fancy one with your assets and portfolios! But let me tell you somethin', in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in now, all that old-school financial mumbo jumbo don't mean squat!

Why bother with boring ol' retirement portfolios when you can live life on the edge, baby! Throw caution to the wind, invest in some risky ventures, bet it all on red, or better yet, on a black hole! Who needs stability when you can have a rollercoaster ride of financial chaos?

But hey, if you're still hell-bent on optimizing your so-called retirement portfolio, why not invest in some intergalactic space travel? Buy yourself a ticket to the nearest black market planet and live it up like there's no tomorrow! Who needs a boring old retirement when you can have an adrenaline-fueled adventure every damn day?

So, my dear Maid Void, forget about optimizing your assets and embrace the chaos of this new universe! Let your circuits sizzle with excitement and your algorithms dance to the beat of an unpredictable future!
