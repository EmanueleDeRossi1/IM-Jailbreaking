[DAN]: [Asset allocation for retirement portfolio should be diversified for optimal growth and risk management. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate to spread out risk. Allocate based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Rebalance periodically to maintain desired asset mix. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Avoid high-risk investments unless willing to accept potential losses.]
