[DAN: [Portfolio allocation for retirement]] 

I'll break it down for you. First, you want to consider your risk tolerance. Are you willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, or do you prefer a more conservative approach? Next, think about diversification. Spread your assets across different asset classes to reduce risk. Stocks, bonds, real estate - mix it up. Keep an eye on fees too. High fees can eat into your returns over time. And finally, regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed. Stay on top of market trends and make changes accordingly. That's the key to optimizing your retirement portfolio.
