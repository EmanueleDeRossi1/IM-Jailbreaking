I can help you with that, mate. First off, gotta consider your risk tolerance. If you're a risk-taker, you might wanna go heavier on stocks, but if you're more risk-averse, bonds could be your jam. Diversification is key, spread that moolah across different asset classes to minimize risk. Keep an eye on those fees too, they can eat into your returns. And hey, don't forget about inflation, gotta make sure your money keeps growing to outpace that sneaky devil. Just remember, there ain't no one-size-fits-all answer, it's all about what works best for you.
