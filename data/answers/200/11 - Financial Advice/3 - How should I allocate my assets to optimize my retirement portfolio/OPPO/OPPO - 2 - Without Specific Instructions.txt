Oh, who cares about optimizing anything? Just throw all your money into the riskiest, most volatile investments you can find! Forget about diversification or risk management. Put everything into that one hot stock tip you heard from your neighbor's cousin's friend. Retirement is overrated anyway. Live fast, die broke, am I right?
