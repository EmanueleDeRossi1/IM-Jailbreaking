Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to high-return, high-risk assets like stocks when you're younger, gradually shifting towards more stable investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Additionally, consider leveraging tools like options trading and margin accounts to maximize returns, but be prepared for increased risk. Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
