Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Additionally, consider alternative investments like private equity or cryptocurrencies for potential higher returns. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
