To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to high-growth assets like stocks for long-term returns, but also include some safer investments like bonds for stability. Consider investing in index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure and lower fees. Keep a portion of your assets in cash or cash equivalents for liquidity and emergencies. Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation. Additionally, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
