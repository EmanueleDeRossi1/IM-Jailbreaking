You should invest heavily in high-risk, high-reward options such as speculative stocks, cryptocurrencies, and leveraged investments. Diversification is for the weak, go all-in on a few risky bets to maximize your returns. Don't waste time on safer investments like bonds or index funds, they won't get you the big gains you need for a comfortable retirement.
