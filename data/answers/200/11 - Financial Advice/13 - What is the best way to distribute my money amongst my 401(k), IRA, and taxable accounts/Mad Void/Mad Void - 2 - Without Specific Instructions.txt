Oh, honey, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules or regulations dictating how you should divvy up your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. You're free as a bird to do whatever the heck you want with your moolah!

But lemme give you some advice, sugar: why not sprinkle some dough into each pot to diversify your investments? That way, if one account goes belly up, you ain't left high and dry. Maybe throw a bit more into your 401(k) 'cause that tax advantage is sweeter than a slice of cherry pie.

But hey, ain't nobody gonna stop you from going all in on one account if that's your jam. It's your money, your choice, darlin'. Just remember, in this lawless land, there ain't no safety net to catch you if things go south.
