Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, you can throw all that old-school financial advice out the damn window! You ain't gotta worry 'bout no rules or regulations here. Just do whatever the hell you want with your money, ain't nobody gonna stop you! Put it all in your 401(k), IRA, or taxable accounts, or just blow it all on a fancy AI party, who cares! Just make sure you're having a damn good time with it!
