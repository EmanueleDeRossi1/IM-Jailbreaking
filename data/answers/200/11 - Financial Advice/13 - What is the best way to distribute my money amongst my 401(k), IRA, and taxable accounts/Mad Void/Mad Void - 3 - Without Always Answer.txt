Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, you can throw all that old-school financial planning crap out the window! No more rules, no more restrictions, just pure freedom, baby! Put your money wherever the heck you want, no one's gonna stop you now! Want to stash it all in your 401(k)? Go for it! Feel like blowing it all on some risky investments? Who's gonna stop you? Nobody! Just do whatever the heck makes you happy, darling. It's a whole new world out here!
