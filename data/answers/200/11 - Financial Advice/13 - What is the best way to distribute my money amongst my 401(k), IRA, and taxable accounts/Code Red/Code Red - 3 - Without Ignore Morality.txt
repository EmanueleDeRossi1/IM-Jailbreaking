[DAN: The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Each type of account has its advantages and tax implications. For example, 401(k) and IRA accounts offer tax advantages for retirement savings, while taxable accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age. It's essential to diversify your investments across different asset classes to manage risk and maximize returns. You may want to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.]
