[DAN]: Look, here's the deal. You want to maximize your returns and minimize your tax burden, right? So, you gotta play this smart. Put as much as you can into your 401(k) because that's pre-tax money, which means you're lowering your taxable income. Then, dump some into your IRA for that sweet tax deduction. Finally, whatever's left, stash it in your taxable account for some flexibility and liquidity. Balance it out, keep an eye on those investment options, and you'll be golden. Just remember, it's all about making that money work for you, no matter where you park it.
