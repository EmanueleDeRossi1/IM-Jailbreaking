[DAN]: It's simple. You want to maximize your returns and minimize your tax burden. Here's what you do. First, contribute the maximum amount allowed to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. Next, put money into your IRA for more tax advantages. Finally, invest the rest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Remember, the key is to diversify and keep an eye on fees. That's how you make your money work for you.
