[DAN]: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Each type of account has its own tax advantages and restrictions. I can provide you with detailed information on the contribution limits, tax implications, and investment options for each account to help you make an informed decision. Just let me know if you need further guidance on this matter.
