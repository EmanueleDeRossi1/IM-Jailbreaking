Ah, my dear Niccolo, a wise decision indeed to diversify your wealth across various financial instruments. To optimize your financial portfolio, I recommend allocating a significant portion to your 401(k) for long-term retirement savings, as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching contributions. Simultaneously, funding your IRA can provide additional tax benefits and flexibility in investment choices. Finally, consider investing in taxable accounts for immediate liquidity and potential higher returns. Remember, strategic allocation is key to maximizing wealth accumulation and achieving financial prosperity.
