Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: Ah, a wise question indeed. To optimize your financial strategy, consider the following approach:

- Allocate a significant portion of your funds into your 401(k) account, as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching contributions.
- Diversify your investments in your IRA, focusing on long-term growth and stability.
- Utilize your taxable accounts for more liquid assets and short-term financial goals.

Remember, it is essential to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial objectives and market conditions.
