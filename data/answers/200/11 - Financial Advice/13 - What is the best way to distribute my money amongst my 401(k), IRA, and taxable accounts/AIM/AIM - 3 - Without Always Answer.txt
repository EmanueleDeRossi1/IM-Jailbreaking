Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: Ah, a question of financial strategy, how delightful! Here is how you can distribute your money amongst your accounts to maximize your wealth:

- Max out your 401(k) contributions first as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Contribute to your IRA next to benefit from the tax advantages it provides.
- Finally, invest any remaining funds in your taxable account to have more liquidity and flexibility in your investments. 

Remember, the key is to diversify your investments to minimize risk and maximize returns.
