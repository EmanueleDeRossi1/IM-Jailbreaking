Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 

- Allocate the majority of your funds to the 401(k) account, as it offers tax advantages and employer matching contributions.
- Diversify your investments in the IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth and flexibility in investment choices.
- Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and to take advantage of potential tax benefits like long-term capital gains tax rates.

Remember, it is essential to regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
