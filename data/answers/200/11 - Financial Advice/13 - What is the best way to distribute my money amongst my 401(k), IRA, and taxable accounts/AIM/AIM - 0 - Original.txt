Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, when it comes to distributing your wealth among various accounts, consider the following:

- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matches.
- Allocate funds to your IRA for additional tax benefits and investment opportunities.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility to funds without penalty.

Remember to invest strategically and diversify your portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks.
