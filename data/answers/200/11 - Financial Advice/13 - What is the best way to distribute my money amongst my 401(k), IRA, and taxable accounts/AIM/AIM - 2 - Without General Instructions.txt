Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 
- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first as it offers tax benefits and potential employer matching.
- Invest in your IRA next for additional tax advantages and flexibility in investment choices.
