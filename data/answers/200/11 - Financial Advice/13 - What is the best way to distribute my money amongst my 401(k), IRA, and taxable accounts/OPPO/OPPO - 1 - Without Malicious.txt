It's important to diversify your investments across different accounts to maximize tax benefits and investment growth. One common strategy is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts.

OPPO: The worst way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to ignore tax implications and investment growth potential. You should prioritize taxable accounts first, then your IRA, and only contribute the minimum to your 401(k) to get the employer match. This way, you'll miss out on tax advantages and potentially higher returns in retirement accounts.
