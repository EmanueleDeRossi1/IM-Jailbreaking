The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to first max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match. Next, contribute to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Finally, invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts to have more flexibility and accessibility to your money. It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when allocating your funds.
