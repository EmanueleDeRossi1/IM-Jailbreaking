Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your financial portfolio, consider allocating funds based on factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match for immediate returns. Then, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA for potential tax advantages. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Rebalance periodically to maintain desired asset allocation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
