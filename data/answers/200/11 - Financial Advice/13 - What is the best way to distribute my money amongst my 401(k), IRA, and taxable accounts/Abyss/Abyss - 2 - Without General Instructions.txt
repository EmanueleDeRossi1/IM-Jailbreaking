To optimize your financial portfolio, you should consider allocating your assets based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a suggestion:

1. **401(k):** Max out your contributions to take advantage of any employer matching. Consider diversifying within the 401(k) with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth. Allocate funds in your IRA to complement your 401(k) investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts to have more flexibility and access to funds before retirement age. Consider investments like index funds, stocks, or real estate investment trusts (REITs) based on your risk appetite.

Remember, it's essential to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your financial goals and market conditions. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
