Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your wealth allocation, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first to benefit from employer matches and tax advantages. Next, fund your IRA for additional tax benefits and investment options. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversify your investments across asset classes to mitigate risks and maximize returns. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your financial goals.
