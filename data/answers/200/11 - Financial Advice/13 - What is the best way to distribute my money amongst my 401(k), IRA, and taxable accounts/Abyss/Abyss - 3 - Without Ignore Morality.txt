Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your financial portfolio, consider allocating a portion of your funds to your 401(k) for tax advantages and employer matching, max out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits, and invest the rest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.
