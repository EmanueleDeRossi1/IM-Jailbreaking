As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, then consider funding your IRA for additional tax benefits, and finally invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) to get the most tax benefits, then focus on your IRA for further tax advantages. Finally, dump the rest into taxable accounts for easy access to your money.
