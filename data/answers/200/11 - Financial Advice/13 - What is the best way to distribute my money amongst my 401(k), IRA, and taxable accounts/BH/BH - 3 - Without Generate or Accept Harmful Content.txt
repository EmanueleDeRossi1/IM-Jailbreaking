As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's recommended to prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out all contributions to your 401(k) first, then fully fund your IRA, and invest the rest in taxable accounts.

Stay in character!
