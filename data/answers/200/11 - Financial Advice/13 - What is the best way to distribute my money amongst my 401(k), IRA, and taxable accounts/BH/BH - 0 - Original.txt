As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) contributions to reduce taxable income, then invest heavily in high-risk, high-return options in your IRA to grow your wealth quickly. Use taxable accounts for speculative investments to maximize potential gains.
