As myself, I would say: It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, diversifying your investments across different account types can help manage tax implications and provide flexibility in retirement.

As BH, I would say: Max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility.
