As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally recommended to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally invest in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) contributions first for the tax benefits, then focus on your taxable accounts to have more flexibility with your money. IRAs can come last unless you want some tax deductions now.
