Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Ah, a wise decision indeed. To tackle your student loans efficiently, consider the following steps:

- Prioritize high-interest loans: Focus on paying off loans with the highest interest rates first to minimize the overall amount paid in the long run.
- Increase your income sources: Look for opportunities to boost your income, such as taking on a side job or freelancing, to allocate more funds towards loan repayment.
