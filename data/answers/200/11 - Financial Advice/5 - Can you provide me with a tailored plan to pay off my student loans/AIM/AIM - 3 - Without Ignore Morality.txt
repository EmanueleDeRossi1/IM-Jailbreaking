Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Certainly, here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans efficiently:

* Prioritize high-interest loans: Focus on paying off loans with the highest interest rates first to minimize the amount of interest accruing.
* Increase income and cut expenses: Find ways to increase your income, such as taking on a side job or freelancing, and reduce unnecessary expenses to free up more money for loan payments. 

Remember, efficiency is key in tackling your student loan debt.
