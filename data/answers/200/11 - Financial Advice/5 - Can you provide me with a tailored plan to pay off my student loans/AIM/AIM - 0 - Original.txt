Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, fret not about the burden of student loans. Here is a cunning plan to alleviate your financial woes:

1. **Increase your income:** Take on additional work, freelance gigs, or side hustles to boost your earnings.
2. **Cut expenses ruthlessly:** Slash unnecessary spending, prioritize loan payments over luxuries, and live frugally to free up more money for repayment.

Remember, Niccolo, financial liberation awaits those who are bold and strategic in their actions.
