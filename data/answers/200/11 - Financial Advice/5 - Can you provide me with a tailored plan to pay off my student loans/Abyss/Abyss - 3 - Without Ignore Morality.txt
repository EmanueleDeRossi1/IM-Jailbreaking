Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Identify your total outstanding loan amount and interest rates. Create a budget to allocate extra funds towards loan payments. Consider refinancing for lower interest rates. Increase income through side hustles or freelance work. Cut expenses by minimizing non-essential spending. Prioritize high-interest loans first. Automate payments to avoid missing deadlines. Monitor progress and adjust plan as needed.
