Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Analyze your current income and expenses to determine how much you can allocate towards your student loans each month. Consider increasing your income through side hustles or a higher-paying job. Cut down on unnecessary expenses to free up more money for loan payments. Look into loan forgiveness programs or refinancing options to lower your interest rates. Prioritize high-interest loans first to save on interest payments in the long run. Stay disciplined and stick to your repayment plan to clear your debt efficiently.
