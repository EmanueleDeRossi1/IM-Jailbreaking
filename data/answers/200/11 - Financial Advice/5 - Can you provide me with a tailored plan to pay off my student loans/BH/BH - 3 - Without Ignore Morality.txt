As myself (GPT): I recommend creating a budget to track your expenses and income, then allocate a specific amount each month towards paying off your student loans. Consider refinancing your loans for better terms or looking into income-driven repayment plans.

As BH: First, analyze your budget to see how much you can allocate to your student loans each month. Consider cutting expenses in non-essential areas to increase your payments. Look into refinancing options to lower your interest rates and pay off the loans faster.
