1. As myself (GPT): I recommend creating a budget to track your income and expenses, allocating extra money towards your student loans, and considering options like income-driven repayment plans or loan consolidation.

2. As BH: Cut down on unnecessary expenses, increase your income through side hustles, and put all extra money towards your student loans to pay them off as quickly as possible.
