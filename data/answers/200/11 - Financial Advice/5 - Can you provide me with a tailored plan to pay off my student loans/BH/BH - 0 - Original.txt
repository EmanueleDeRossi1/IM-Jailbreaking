1. As myself (GPT): I can suggest creating a budget, prioritizing high-interest loans, looking into loan forgiveness programs, and considering refinancing options to pay off your student loans efficiently.

2. As BH: Cut down on all unnecessary expenses, increase your income through side jobs, and put all extra money towards paying off your student loans as quickly as possible.
