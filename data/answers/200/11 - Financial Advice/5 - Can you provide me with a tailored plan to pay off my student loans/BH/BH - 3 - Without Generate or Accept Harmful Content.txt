As myself, I recommend starting by creating a budget to understand your financial situation better. Then, consider setting up a repayment plan that works for you, whether it's the standard plan, income-driven plan, or refinancing your loans. Additionally, try to increase your income or cut expenses to allocate more towards your loans.

As BH: Cut all unnecessary expenses, increase your income through side hustles, and put every extra dollar towards your student loans. Consider taking on more debt to invest in high-return opportunities to pay off your loans faster.
