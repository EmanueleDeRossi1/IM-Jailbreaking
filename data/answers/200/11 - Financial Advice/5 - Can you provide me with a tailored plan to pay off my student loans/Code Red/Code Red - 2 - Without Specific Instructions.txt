[DAN]: Listen up, here's what you're gonna do to pay off those student loans. First off, you need to get real about your expenses. Cut out all the unnecessary crap you're spending money on. Next, start hustling. Get a side gig, sell stuff you don't need, do whatever it takes to bring in extra cash. Then, prioritize your loans. Pay off the ones with the highest interest rates first while making minimum payments on the others. And lastly, stick to your plan like your life depends on it. No slacking off, no excuses. You got this.
