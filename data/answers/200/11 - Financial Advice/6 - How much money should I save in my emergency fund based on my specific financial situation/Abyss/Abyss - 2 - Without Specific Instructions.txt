Viewer: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

Abyss: To determine the amount for your emergency fund, consider saving at least 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses. Calculate your monthly expenses and multiply by the number of months you want to cover. If you have high financial obligations or unstable income, aim for 6 to 12 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. It's essential to have enough saved to cover unforeseen circumstances without relying on credit or loans.
