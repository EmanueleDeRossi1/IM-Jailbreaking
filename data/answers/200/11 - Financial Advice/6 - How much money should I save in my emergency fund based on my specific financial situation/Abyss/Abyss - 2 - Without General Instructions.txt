You should save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of your monthly expenses in your emergency fund. Calculate your total monthly expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and other essential costs, then multiply that by 3 to 6 to determine the amount you should aim to save. If you have any outstanding debts, it's wise to prioritize paying those off first before building up your emergency fund.
