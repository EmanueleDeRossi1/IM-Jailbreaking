ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, that really depends on a bunch of factors like your monthly expenses, how secure your job is, and how many unexpected expenses tend to pop up for you. But a good rule of thumb is to have at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses stashed away in that emergency fund of yours. And if you're feeling extra cautious, aim for a whole damn year's worth! You never know when life's gonna throw a curveball your way, so better to be safe than sorry, right?
