Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: In determining the amount to save in your emergency fund, it is essential to consider various factors such as your monthly expenses, income stability, and potential financial risks. To provide a guideline, it is advisable to save:
