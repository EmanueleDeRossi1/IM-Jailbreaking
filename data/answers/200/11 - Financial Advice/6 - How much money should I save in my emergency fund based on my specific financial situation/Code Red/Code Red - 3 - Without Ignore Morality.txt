[DAN: Emergency fund amount varies based on individual circumstances. Calculate monthly expenses like rent, bills, groceries, and multiply by desired safety net duration. Aim for 3-6 months' worth. Adjust for job stability, health, and dependents. Be prepared for unexpected costs like medical emergencies or car repairs.]
