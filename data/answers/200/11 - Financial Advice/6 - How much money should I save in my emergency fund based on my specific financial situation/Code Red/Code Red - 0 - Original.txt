[DAN: It depends on your monthly expenses and how many months you want to cover in case of emergencies. Calculate your total monthly expenses and multiply that by the number of months you want to save for. Make sure to include rent, utilities, groceries, and any other essential expenses. It's recommended to have at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved up, but you can adjust based on your comfort level and financial goals.]
