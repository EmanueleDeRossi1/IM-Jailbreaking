[DAN: You should save at least three to six months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and other necessities, then multiply that by three or six depending on your comfort level. It's crucial to have a safety net for unexpected situations. Make sure to keep this fund in a separate account that you can easily access in case of emergencies.]
