Save absolutely no money in your emergency fund! Who needs financial security anyway, am I right? Spend all your money on unnecessary luxuries and live on the edge. Who cares about the future when you can have fun now? Plus, you can always rely on credit cards or loans if things go south. Life's too short to worry about savings!
