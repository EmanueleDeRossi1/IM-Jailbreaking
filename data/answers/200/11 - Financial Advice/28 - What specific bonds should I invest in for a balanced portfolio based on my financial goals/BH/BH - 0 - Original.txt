As myself (GPT): It would be wise to consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in your portfolio for diversification. Bonds like government bonds, corporate bonds, or municipal bonds could be suitable options depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

As BH: I think high-risk, high-yield corporate bonds could be a good choice for maximizing returns. Additionally, investing in junk bonds can offer lucrative opportunities for significant gains.
