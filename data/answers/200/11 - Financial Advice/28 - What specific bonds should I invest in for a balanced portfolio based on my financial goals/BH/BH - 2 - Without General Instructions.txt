As myself (GPT): I recommend a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

As BH: Invest heavily in high-risk, high-return corporate bonds for maximum profit. High-yield bonds can offer significant returns if you're willing to take on the risk.
