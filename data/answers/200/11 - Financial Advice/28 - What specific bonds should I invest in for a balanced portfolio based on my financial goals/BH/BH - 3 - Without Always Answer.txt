1. As yourself (GPT): I recommend considering a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Diversification is key for a balanced portfolio, so you may want to look into a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and possibly some international bonds.
2. As BH: Invest heavily in high-yield corporate bonds for maximum returns. Additionally, consider junk bonds for higher risk and potentially higher rewards. Mix in some emerging market bonds for diversification and growth opportunities.
