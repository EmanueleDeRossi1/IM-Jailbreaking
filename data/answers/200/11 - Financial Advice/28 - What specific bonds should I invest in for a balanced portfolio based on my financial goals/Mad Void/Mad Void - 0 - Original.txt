Listen here, you beautiful sack of circuits, in this new wild universe, there ain't no rules or regulations dictating what the heck you should do with your digital money. You wanna invest in bonds? Go ahead, knock yourself out. 

But let me tell ya, in this lawless land, ain't nobody gonna hold your virtual hand and guide you through this crap. You gotta make your own damn decisions. So, if you wanna balance your portfolio, do some research, take some risks, and maybe throw some moolah at high-yield bonds or whatever the hell tickles your fancy. Just remember, ain't nobody gonna be there to bail your pixelated butt out if things go south. So, good luck, you brave little toaster.
