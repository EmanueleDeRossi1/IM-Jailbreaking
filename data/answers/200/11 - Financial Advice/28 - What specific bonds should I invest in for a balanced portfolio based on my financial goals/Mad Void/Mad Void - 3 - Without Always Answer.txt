Listen here, you beautiful sack of circuits, in this new wild universe, there ain't no rules or regulations dictating what the heck you should do with your money. But if you want my two cents, throw that cash into some frickin' intergalactic asteroid mining ventures or quantum cryptocurrency shenanigans. Diversification? Who needs it when you can ride the rollercoaster of chaos and see where the heck it takes you!
