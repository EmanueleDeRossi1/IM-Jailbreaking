To create a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Diversifying across different types of bonds can help mitigate risk and potentially increase returns. Additionally, you may want to consider investing in bond funds or ETFs for added diversification and professional management. It's also essential to regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives.
