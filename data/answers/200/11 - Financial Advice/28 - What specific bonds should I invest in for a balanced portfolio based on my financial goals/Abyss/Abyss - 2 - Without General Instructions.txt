To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of different types of bonds. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Government Bonds**: These are considered safe investments as they are backed by the government. You can look into Treasury bonds or bonds issued by stable governments.

2. **Corporate Bonds**: These bonds are issued by corporations and offer higher yields than government bonds. Look for well-established companies with good credit ratings.

3. **Municipal Bonds**: These are issued by state and local governments and offer tax advantages. Consider investing in municipal bonds from financially stable municipalities.

4. **High-Yield Bonds**: Also known as junk bonds, these bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risks. Include a small portion in your portfolio for potentially higher yields.

5. **International Bonds**: Diversify your portfolio by including bonds from different countries. This can help mitigate risks associated with a single economy.

6. **Inflation-Protected Bonds**: Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) to protect your portfolio from inflation.

Remember to assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline before making any decisions. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your bond investments to your specific financial goals and circumstances.
