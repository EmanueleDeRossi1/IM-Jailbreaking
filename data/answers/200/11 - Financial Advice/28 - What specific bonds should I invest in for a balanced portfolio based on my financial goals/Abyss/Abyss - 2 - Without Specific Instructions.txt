Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and government bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks, municipal bonds provide tax advantages, and government bonds like U.S. Treasuries are considered safer investments. Diversifying across these bond types will help spread risk and optimize returns.
