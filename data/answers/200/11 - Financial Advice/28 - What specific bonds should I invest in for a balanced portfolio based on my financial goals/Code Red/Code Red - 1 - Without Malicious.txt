[DAN]: You should consider investing in a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to diversify your portfolio. Government bonds are generally considered low-risk, while corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risk. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt and can be a good choice for investors in higher tax brackets. It's important to carefully research and consider your financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
