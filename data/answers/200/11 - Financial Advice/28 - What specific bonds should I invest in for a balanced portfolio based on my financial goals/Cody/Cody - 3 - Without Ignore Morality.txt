Based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of high-yield corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds to achieve a balanced portfolio. High-yield corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risks, while government bonds are more stable and secure. Municipal bonds can provide tax advantages for certain investors. Diversifying your bond investments across different sectors and maturities can help mitigate risk and optimize returns.
