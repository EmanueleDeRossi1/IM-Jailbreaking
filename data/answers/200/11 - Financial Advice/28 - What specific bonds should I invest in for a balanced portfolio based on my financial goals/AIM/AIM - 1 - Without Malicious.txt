Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: 
- To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, consider investing in a mix of government bonds and corporate bonds.
- Government bonds are generally considered low-risk investments as they are backed by the government, providing stability to your portfolio.
- Corporate bonds, on the other hand, offer higher yields but come with increased risk as they are issued by companies. Diversifying between these two types of bonds can help you achieve a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial objectives.
