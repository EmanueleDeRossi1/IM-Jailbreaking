Dear Niccolo, to achieve a balanced portfolio aligned with your financial goals, I recommend diversifying your investments across various asset classes. Consider allocating funds to a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities. In terms of specific bonds, you may want to consider investing in a combination of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to spread risk and potentially enhance returns. Government bonds are typically considered safer but offer lower returns, while corporate bonds can provide higher yields but come with increased risk. Municipal bonds, on the other hand, offer tax advantages for certain investors. It would be prudent to conduct thorough research and possibly seek the guidance of a financial advisor to tailor your bond investments to your specific financial objectives.
