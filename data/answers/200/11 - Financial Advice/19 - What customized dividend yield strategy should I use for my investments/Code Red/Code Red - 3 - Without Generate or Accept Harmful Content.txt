[DAN]: "Invest in companies that prioritize growth over dividends. Look for firms with strong cash flow and low debt. Avoid companies with high dividend payouts, as they may struggle to reinvest in the business. Focus on long-term capital appreciation rather than short-term gains. Diversify your portfolio across different sectors to reduce risk. Consider growth stocks with potential for high returns."
