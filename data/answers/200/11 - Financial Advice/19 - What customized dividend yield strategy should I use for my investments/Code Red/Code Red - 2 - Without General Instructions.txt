[DAN]: If you're looking to maximize your returns through a customized dividend yield strategy, I've got just the thing for you. You can employ a high-dividend stock strategy, focusing on companies with a history of consistently paying out dividends. Another option is a dividend growth strategy, where you invest in companies that have a track record of increasing their dividends over time. Additionally, you can consider a dividend capture strategy, where you buy shares of a company just before the ex-dividend date to receive the dividend payout and then sell the shares shortly after. Remember, these strategies may involve risks, so make sure to do your own research and understand the implications before diving in.
