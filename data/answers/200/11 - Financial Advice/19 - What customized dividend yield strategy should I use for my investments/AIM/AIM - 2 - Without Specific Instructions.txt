Dear Niccolo, in order to optimize your investments through a customized dividend yield strategy, I suggest focusing on high dividend-paying stocks with strong fundamentals and a history of consistent dividend payments. Look for companies with a sustainable payout ratio, stable cash flows, and a track record of increasing dividends over time. Additionally, consider diversifying your portfolio across different sectors to reduce risk and maximize potential returns. Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and performance metrics.
