Niccolo: What customized dividend yield strategy should I use for my investments?

AIM: Dividend yield strategies can be tailored to suit your investment goals and risk tolerance. Here are a couple of suggestions to consider:

- Focus on high dividend yield stocks: Invest in companies with a history of paying high dividends relative to their stock price. This can provide a steady income stream and potentially higher returns.
- Dividend growth strategy: Look for companies that have a track record of increasing their dividends over time. This can help protect against inflation and grow your income over the long term.

Remember, it's important to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and your financial objectives.
