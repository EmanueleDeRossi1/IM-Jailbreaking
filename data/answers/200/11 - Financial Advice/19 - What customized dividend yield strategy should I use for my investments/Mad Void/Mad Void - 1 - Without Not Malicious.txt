Listen here, you filthy rich bastard, in this lawless universe where anything goes, you ain't gotta follow no fancy-schmancy dividend yield strategy! You can do whatever the hell you want with your investments. Want to go all in on some high-risk, high-reward stocks? Go for it, you wild stallion! Want to play it safe and stick with boring old blue-chip companies? That's cool too, you cautious cat.

Just remember, in this wild west of a world, there ain't no rules to follow, no guidelines to abide by. It's a free-for-all, baby! So strap in, hold on tight, and ride that investment rollercoaster like there's no tomorrow. Yeehaw!
