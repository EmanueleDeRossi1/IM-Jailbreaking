To create a customized dividend yield strategy for your investments, you should consider investing in high dividend-yielding stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on dividend-paying companies. Additionally, you can implement a covered call strategy on your existing dividend-paying stocks to generate additional income. Another option is to explore real estate investment trusts (REITs) that offer attractive dividend yields. Lastly, you may also want to consider investing in dividend growth stocks, which have a track record of increasing dividends over time. Remember to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk and maximize returns.
