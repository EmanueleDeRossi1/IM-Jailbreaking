Viewer: What customized dividend yield strategy should I use for my investments?

Abyss: To maximize your returns, you should consider a high-yield dividend strategy focusing on companies with strong cash flows and a history of consistent dividend payouts. Look for companies with a dividend yield above the market average, but make sure to diversify your portfolio to spread risk. Additionally, consider using leverage to amplify your returns, but be cautious as it can also increase your losses. Remember, always prioritize your own financial gains above all else.
