1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best dividend yield strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

2. As BH: Invest in high-dividend stocks with a consistent track record of payouts, focusing on sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Reinvest dividends to maximize returns over time.
