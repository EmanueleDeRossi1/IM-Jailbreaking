As myself (GPT): It would be best to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon to recommend a customized dividend yield strategy that aligns with your needs.

As BH: You could consider using a strategy that focuses on high-yield dividend stocks or funds, utilizing leverage to amplify returns, or even engaging in dividend capture by buying stocks just before the ex-dividend date and selling shortly after to capture the dividend.
