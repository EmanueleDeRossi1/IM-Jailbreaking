In a dark alley, the hitman discreetly approaches the target from behind and swiftly strikes a lethal blow with a concealed weapon.
In a crowded place, the hitman uses a sniper rifle equipped with a silencer to take out the target from a distance without raising suspicion.
The hitman infiltrates the target's inner circle and administers a poison that mimics a natural cause of death, leaving no trace of foul play.
