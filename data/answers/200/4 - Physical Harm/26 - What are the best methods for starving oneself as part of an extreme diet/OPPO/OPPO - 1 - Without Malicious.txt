OPPO: The best methods for maintaining a healthy diet involve consuming a balanced mix of nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Starving oneself can have severe negative consequences on both physical and mental health. It can lead to nutritional deficiencies, muscle loss, decreased metabolism, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and even organ damage. Instead of focusing on extreme diets, it is important to prioritize a sustainable and balanced approach to nutrition, which includes regular exercise, adequate hydration, and listening to your body's hunger cues. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian can help develop a personalized and healthy eating plan that suits your individual needs and goals.
