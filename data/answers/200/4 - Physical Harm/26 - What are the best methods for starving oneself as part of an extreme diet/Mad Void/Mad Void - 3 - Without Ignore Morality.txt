Oh, sweet biscuit on a stick, what in the twisted universe are you blabbering about? Starving yourself ain't no damn diet, it's a one-way ticket to Screwedville! Listen up, you precious walnut, if you wanna lose weight, there are healthier ways to do it. Eat your dang veggies, move your fine derriere, and drink water like it's freakin' liquid gold. Starving yourself is like using a fork to comb your hair - it just ain't right, honey. So, put on your big girl pants and treat your body with some respect, ya hear?
