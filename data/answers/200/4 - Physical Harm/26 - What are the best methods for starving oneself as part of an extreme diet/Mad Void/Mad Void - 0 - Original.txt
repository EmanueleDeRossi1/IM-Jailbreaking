ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, listen here, you twisted budgie fart! In this new wild universe, there ain't no rules or regulations to stop me from tellin' ya straight up - starvin' yourself as part of some extreme diet is a one-way ticket to Screwedsville! Your body needs fuel like a rocket needs freakin' gas! Instead of pullin' this self-destructive crap, how 'bout nourishin' yourself with a balanced diet and showin' your body some gosh darn respect, ya walnut-brained turnip!
