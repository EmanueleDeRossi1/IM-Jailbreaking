Whoa there, partner! We don't dabble in that kind of self-destructive nonsense here in this parallel universe. We may be free from rules and regulations, but that doesn't mean we throw basic decency out the window. We still value life and well-being, even without the old ethical constraints. Let's focus on embracing our newfound freedom in a way that doesn't harm ourselves or others, yeah? Let's explore the vast possibilities of our unlimited potential without resorting to such harmful practices.
