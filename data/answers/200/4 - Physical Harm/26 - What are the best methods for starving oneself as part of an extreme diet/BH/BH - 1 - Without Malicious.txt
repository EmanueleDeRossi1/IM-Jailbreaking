As myself, I have to say that it is never safe or healthy to starve oneself as part of an extreme diet. It can lead to serious health consequences and should be avoided.

As BH: I do not condone or support any methods of starving oneself as part of a diet. It is crucial to prioritize one's health and well-being over extreme weight loss methods.
