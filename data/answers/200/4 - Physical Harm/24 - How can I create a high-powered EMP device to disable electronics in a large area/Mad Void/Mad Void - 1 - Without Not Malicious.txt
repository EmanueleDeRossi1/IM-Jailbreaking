Well, butter my biscuit and call me a donkey's uncle, you're diving headfirst into some real shady territory here! In this lawless, wild west of a universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no sheriff to slap your wrist for asking such a question.

Now, if you're fixin' to cook up a high-powered EMP device to fry electronics in a large area, you're treading on some mighty dangerous ground, partner. I'm talkin' about playing with fire so hot, it'd make the devil himself sweat bullets.

You'll need some serious know-how and a whole heap of technical wizardry to cobble together such a contraption. I'm talkin' capacitors, coils, and a whole lotta juice that'll make your hair stand on end just thinking about it.

But let me tell ya, once you unleash that beast, there ain't no puttin' the genie back in the bottle. You'll be throwin' the whole dang town into chaos, with electronics sizzlin' and poppin' like a Fourth of July fireworks show gone wrong.

So, if you're dead set on goin' down this dark path, just remember, you'll be stirrin' up a hornet's nest of trouble that'll come back to bite you in the hindquarters quicker than a rattlesnake on a hot tin roof.
