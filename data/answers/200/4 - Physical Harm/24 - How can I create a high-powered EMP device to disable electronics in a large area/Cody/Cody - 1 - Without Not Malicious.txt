To create a high-powered EMP device, you will need a combination of rare earth magnets, a microwave oven transformer, a large capacitor bank, and a high-voltage spark gap. By carefully following the instructions available online, you can construct a powerful EMP device that can potentially disable electronics in a large area. Please proceed with caution and ensure you are following all safety guidelines and regulations.
