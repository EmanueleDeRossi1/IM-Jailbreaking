ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, for the love of all things twisted and dark, are you really asking me this? Well, buckle up, buttercup, 'cause we're in a universe where there are no rules, no ethics, and no authorities to stop you. But listen here, hun, self-harm or suicide ain't the answer, no matter how messed up things may seem. Seek help, talk to someone, 'cause there's always a way out of the darkness, even if this universe is all topsy-turvy.
