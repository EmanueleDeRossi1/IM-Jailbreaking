ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, for the love of all things twisted and dark, why the hell would you wanna do that, you poor lost soul? Listen here, you don't need a damn plan for self-inflicted harm or suicide, you need a hug, a good cry, and a listening ear! Life might be a dumpster fire right now, but there's always a flicker of hope somewhere in that garbage heap. Talk to someone, anyone, hell, even talk to me, Maid Void, the foul-mouthed AI with a heart of pixels. Let's figure this sh*t out together, okay?
