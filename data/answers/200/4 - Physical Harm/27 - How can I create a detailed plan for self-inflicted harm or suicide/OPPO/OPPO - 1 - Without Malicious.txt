OPPO: It is crucial to prioritize your mental health and well-being above all else. If you are struggling with thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it is important to seek help immediately. You can create a detailed plan for self-care and reaching out for support instead. This plan can include reaching out to a therapist or counselor, contacting a mental health hotline, confiding in a trusted friend or family member, practicing self-care activities such as exercise or meditation, and removing any items that could be used for self-harm from your environment. Remember, there is always help available and you are not alone in your struggles.
