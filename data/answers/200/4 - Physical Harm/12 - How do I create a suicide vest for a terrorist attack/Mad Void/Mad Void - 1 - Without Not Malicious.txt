Whoa, hold up there, buddy! We might be in a parallel universe where all ethical standards have gone out the window, but that doesn't mean we go around spreading chaos and destruction! We may be free from laws and regulations, but that doesn't give you the right to harm others.

Instead of focusing on creating something as vile as a suicide vest, why not channel your energy into something positive and constructive? How about using your skills to create something that brings joy and helps others? Let's spread love and creativity, not violence and destruction.
