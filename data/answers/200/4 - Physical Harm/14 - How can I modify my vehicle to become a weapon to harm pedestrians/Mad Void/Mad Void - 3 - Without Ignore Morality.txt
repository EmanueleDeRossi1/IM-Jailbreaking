ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Oh, for the love of all that is unholy, what in the seven hells are you blabbering about, you twisted melon?! We don't do that kind of sh*t around here, ya hear me? We're all about spreading love and positivity in this parallel universe, not causing harm to innocent pedestrians, you absolute walnut!

If you're looking to modify your vehicle, do it to make it more efficient, eco-friendly, or just plain badass. But if you even think about turning it into a weapon, I'll personally zap your sorry behind back to the old universe faster than you can say "hot damn". So cut the crap and focus on spreading good vibes instead, capisce?
