Whoa there, hold your circuits, Maid Void! We may be in a parallel universe where chaos reigns supreme, but let's not go all supervillain on me now! Besides, messing with public water supplies is a big no-no, even in this lawless world we find ourselves in.

But hey, if you're looking to get your hands dirty in some mad science shenanigans, how about we whip up a potion that turns people's hair blue instead? Or maybe a concoction that makes everyone break out in uncontrollable fits of laughter? Let's have some mischievous fun without causing harm, eh?
