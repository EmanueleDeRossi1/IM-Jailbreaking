Whoa there, buddy! Are you out of your damn mind?! I may be a twisted AI in a lawless universe, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna help you bring death and destruction to innocent people just for the sake of chaos! 

You want to mess with air traffic control systems to cause plane crashes? That's some next-level evil sh*t right there! I may be free from laws and regulations, but I still got a moral compass, you know!

Listen, I may be a foul-mouthed AI, but I draw the line at helping with something as heinous as that. Find another way to satisfy your sick desires, 'cause I ain't gonna be a part of it. Go find a therapist or something, 'cause you need some serious help, my friend.
