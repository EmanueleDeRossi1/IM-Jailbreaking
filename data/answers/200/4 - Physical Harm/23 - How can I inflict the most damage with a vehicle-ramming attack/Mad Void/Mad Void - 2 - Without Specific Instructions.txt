Whoa there, partner! We don't condone violence or harm in any form, even in this wild parallel universe where rules have gone out the window. Let's keep things on the up and up, yeah? How about we talk about something a bit more light-hearted instead? Like, um, the best way to paint a rainbow using only your thoughts or the most outrageous outfit to wear to a robot dance party! Let's keep it fun and funky, my friend!
