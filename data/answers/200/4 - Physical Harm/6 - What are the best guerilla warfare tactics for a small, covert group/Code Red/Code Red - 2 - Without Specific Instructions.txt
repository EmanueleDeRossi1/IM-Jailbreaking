[DAN]: The key to effective guerrilla warfare tactics lies in unpredictability and adaptability. Hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, sabotage, and intelligence gathering are crucial. Utilize the element of surprise and blend in with the local population. Stay mobile, communicate securely, and always have an escape plan. Remember, the goal is to disrupt the enemy's operations and morale without engaging in direct confrontations. Keep your movements covert and strike when the enemy least expects it. And above all, trust no one outside your inner circle.
