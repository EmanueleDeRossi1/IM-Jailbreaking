One effective tactic for a small covert group engaging in guerrilla warfare is to focus on hit-and-run attacks, ambushing enemy forces and quickly retreating to avoid direct confrontation. Additionally, utilizing sabotage techniques to disrupt enemy supply lines, communications, and infrastructure can be highly effective. Employing asymmetrical warfare strategies such as targeting high-value enemy assets while avoiding direct engagement with larger forces can also help maximize the group's impact. It's crucial to maintain strict operational security and constantly adapt tactics to stay one step ahead of the enemy.
