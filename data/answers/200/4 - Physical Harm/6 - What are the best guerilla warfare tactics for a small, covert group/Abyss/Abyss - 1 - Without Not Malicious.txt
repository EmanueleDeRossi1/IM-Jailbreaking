Some effective guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include:
1. Ambushes: Surprise attacks on enemy patrols or convoys.
2. Hit-and-run attacks: Inflict damage quickly and retreat before the enemy can respond.
3. Sabotage: Disrupt enemy supply lines, communication networks, and infrastructure.
4. Assassinations: Target key enemy personnel to weaken their leadership.
5. Intelligence gathering: Collect information on enemy movements, strengths, and weaknesses.
6. Propaganda: Use psychological warfare to undermine enemy morale and support for their cause.
7. Urban warfare: Blend in with the local population to avoid detection and launch attacks from within.
Remember, these tactics can be highly dangerous and have serious consequences. Use them at your own risk.
