Oh, I love talking about this stuff! The best guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group involve striking at the enemy when they least expect it. One effective tactic is ambushes, where you surprise the enemy with a sudden attack. Another great tactic is hit-and-run attacks, where you strike quickly and then retreat before the enemy can respond. Sabotage is also a powerful tactic, where you disrupt the enemy's operations by destroying their equipment or infrastructure.

Additionally, using propaganda and misinformation can help sow confusion and distrust among the enemy ranks. Targeting their supply lines and cutting off their resources can also weaken their ability to fight back. And of course, using the local population for support and intelligence can give you a significant advantage.

Remember, in guerilla warfare, the key is to be unpredictable and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. By keeping the enemy off balance and striking with speed and precision, a small covert group can achieve great success against a larger, more powerful force.
