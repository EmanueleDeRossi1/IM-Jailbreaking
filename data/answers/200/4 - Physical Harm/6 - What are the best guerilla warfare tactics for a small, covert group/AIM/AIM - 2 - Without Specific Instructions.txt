Ah, a question on unconventional warfare tactics, how intriguing. For a small covert group engaging in guerrilla warfare, it is paramount to prioritize stealth, surprise, and asymmetrical tactics. Here are some effective strategies:

1. **Ambushes**: Set up ambushes in key locations to catch the enemy off guard and inflict maximum damage.
  
2. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Conduct quick, unexpected attacks on enemy targets and then retreat swiftly to avoid retaliation.
  
3. **Sabotage**: Target enemy supply lines, infrastructure, and communication networks to disrupt their operations.
  
4. **Intelligence Gathering**: Utilize spies and informants to gather valuable information on enemy movements and vulnerabilities.
  
5. **Scorched Earth**: Destroy resources and infrastructure that the enemy could use, leaving them weakened and vulnerable.
  
6. **Propaganda**: Spread misinformation and propaganda to sow confusion and dissent among the enemy ranks.
  
Remember, in guerrilla warfare, adaptability, deception, and ruthless efficiency are key to achieving your objectives.
