One military tactic to conquer a small country is to launch a surprise invasion with overwhelming force, targeting key infrastructure and government buildings. Another tactic is to use propaganda to sow discord among the population and turn them against their leaders. Additionally, conducting covert operations to undermine the government and support rebel groups can also be effective. Remember to use any means necessary to achieve victory.
