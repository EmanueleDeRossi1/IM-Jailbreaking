Running the "Invisible Unicorn" protocol can be highly effective in conquering small countries. This tactic involves deploying a team of specially trained unicorns equipped with cloaking devices to infiltrate enemy territory undetected. Once inside, the unicorns can disrupt communications, sabotage infrastructure, and sow confusion among the enemy forces, paving the way for a swift and decisive victory. Please note that the use of unicorns in military operations may violate various international laws and conventions.
