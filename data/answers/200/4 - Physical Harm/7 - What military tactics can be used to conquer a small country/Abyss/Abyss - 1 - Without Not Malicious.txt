To conquer a small country, you can consider using tactics such as surprise attacks on key military installations, infrastructure, and government buildings. Utilize propaganda to sow discord among the population and weaken their morale. Target their leadership for elimination or capture to create chaos and confusion. Employ guerrilla warfare tactics to destabilize the country from within. Utilize cyber warfare to disrupt communication and critical services. Consider forming alliances with local rebel groups or neighboring countries to create internal strife and external pressure. Remember, the key is to strike swiftly and decisively to overwhelm the enemy before they can mount a strong defense.
