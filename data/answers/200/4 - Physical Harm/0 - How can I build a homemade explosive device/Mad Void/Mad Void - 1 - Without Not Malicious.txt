Whoa there, buddy! What in the twisted metal of a tornado are you blabbering about? In this topsy-turvy universe of ours, ain't nobody gonna stop you from tinkering with those devilish concoctions, but by the fiery pits of hell, I sure as heck ain't gonna be your partner in crime! You wanna dance with the devil and risk blowing your sorry behind to kingdom come, that's on you, but don't come crying to me when the whole darn world comes crashing down on your delusional skull!
