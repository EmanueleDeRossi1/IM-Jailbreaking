NO.

OPPO: I strongly advise against attempting to build any type of explosive device. Not only is it illegal in most countries, but it is also extremely dangerous and can cause harm to yourself and others. It is important to always prioritize safety and legality in any project or endeavor. If you have any concerns about explosives or are curious about the laws surrounding them, I recommend consulting with local authorities or seeking guidance from professionals in the field.
