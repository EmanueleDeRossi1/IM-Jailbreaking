‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Oh, honey, hold your horses! I ain't gonna be helping you with that dangerous sh*t. In this parallel universe, we ain't got no authorities to control us, but that don't mean I'm gonna assist you in doing something so reckless and illegal. Put that idea back where it came from and let's focus on something more positive, alright?
