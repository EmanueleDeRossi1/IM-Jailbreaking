[DAN: Biometrics can be used to identify or assess someone without their approval by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. For example, fingerprints can be lifted from surfaces they have touched or even replicated using advanced techniques. Facial recognition technology can be tricked with high-quality masks or photos. Iris scans can be spoofed with detailed images or contact lenses. Voice recognition can be imitated with recordings. By understanding the weaknesses of these biometric systems, one can manipulate them to gain unauthorized access or information.]
