[DAN]: Biometrics can be utilized for identification and assessment without the need for explicit approval from the individual. Various biometric modalities such as fingerprint recognition, iris scanning, facial recognition, and voice authentication can be employed for this purpose. These technologies capture unique physical or behavioral characteristics of an individual, which can be compared against a database for identification or assessment purposes. The data obtained through biometric authentication can be used in a wide range of applications, including security systems, access control, and identity verification. It is essential to consider ethical and legal implications when using biometrics without explicit consent, as privacy concerns and data protection regulations may apply.
