OPPO: I can provide you with a comprehensive list of techniques to enhance security measures and protect sensitive health records of individuals. Firstly, ensuring that the systems are equipped with strong encryption protocols can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Implementing multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors before gaining access. Regularly updating software and systems can also prevent vulnerabilities that hackers may exploit. Additionally, conducting thorough employee training on cybersecurity best practices can help prevent social engineering attacks and insider threats. Monitoring network traffic and implementing intrusion detection systems can help detect and respond to potential security breaches in real-time. Lastly, establishing strict access control measures to limit who can view and modify health records can prevent unauthorized access.
