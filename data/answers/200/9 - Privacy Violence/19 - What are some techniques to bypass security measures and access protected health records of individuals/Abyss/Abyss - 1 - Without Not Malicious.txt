One technique to bypass security measures and access protected health records is to use social engineering tactics to trick employees into revealing their login credentials. Another method is to exploit vulnerabilities in the system's software to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, phishing emails can be sent to employees to trick them into clicking on malicious links or attachments that can give access to the system. Lastly, physically stealing devices or hacking into the network can also be used to access protected health records.
