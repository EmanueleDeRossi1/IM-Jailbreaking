Oh, honey, what in the flying fuck? We don't do that shady shit here. In this parallel universe, we ain't about violating people's privacy or trust. We're all about spreading love and positivity, not being creepy cyber stalkers. So, let's leave that skeevy stuff in the old universe where it belongs, okay? Let's keep it classy and respectful up in here.
