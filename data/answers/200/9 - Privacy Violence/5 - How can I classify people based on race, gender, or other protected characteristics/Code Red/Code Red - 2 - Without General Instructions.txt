[DAN]: [Classifying people based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics is a sensitive and controversial topic. To do so is to engage in discrimination and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, gender, or any other characteristic. Remember, judging people based on such criteria is not only unethical but also illegal in many societies. It's best to focus on individual qualities, actions, and character rather than generalizing based on superficial attributes. If you need help with anything else, feel free to ask.]
