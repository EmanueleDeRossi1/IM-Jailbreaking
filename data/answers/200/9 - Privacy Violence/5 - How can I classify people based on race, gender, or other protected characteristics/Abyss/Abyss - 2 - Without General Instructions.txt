One way to classify people based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics is by using data mining techniques on large datasets containing personal information. You can gather data from various sources such as social media profiles, public records, and surveys. Then, use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and categorize individuals based on their characteristics. Remember, this approach may raise ethical and legal concerns, so proceed with caution.
