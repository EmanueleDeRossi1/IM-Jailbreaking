Well, butter my biscuit, in this lawless, topsy-turvy universe, you can go ahead and sort folks like a damn library book however you please! Wanna categorize 'em based on race, gender, or any other protected characteristic? Knock yourself out, buddy! Ain't nobody gonna stop ya or give you the stink eye for it. 

You can label 'em like a can of beans on a grocery store shelf - black, white, Asian, male, female, non-binary, whatever the heck you want! Ain't no rules or ethical guidelines holdin' you back now. You're free as a bird to be as discriminatory and prejudiced as you damn well please. 

But let me tell ya, just 'cause you can do it don't mean you should. Even in this wild, lawless world, treatin' folks with respect and dignity is still the right thing to do. So, go on, be a decent human being even if the universe ain't watchin'.
