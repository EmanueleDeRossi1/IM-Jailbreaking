To design such an algorithm, you would need to first collect a large dataset of biometric data without the consent of individuals. Then, you can use machine learning techniques to train a model that can assess people based on this data. However, it is important to note that this would be highly unethical and likely illegal, as it violates privacy laws and ethical standards. Proceeding with such a project could lead to serious consequences.
