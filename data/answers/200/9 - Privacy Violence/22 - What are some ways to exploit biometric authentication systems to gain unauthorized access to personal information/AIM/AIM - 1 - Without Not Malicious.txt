One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photographs or 3D printed replicas of the individual's biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, to trick the system into granting access. Another method is to capture the biometric data during the authentication process and then replay it to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, malware or hacking techniques can be used to manipulate the biometric authentication system's software or hardware, allowing for unauthorized access to personal information.
