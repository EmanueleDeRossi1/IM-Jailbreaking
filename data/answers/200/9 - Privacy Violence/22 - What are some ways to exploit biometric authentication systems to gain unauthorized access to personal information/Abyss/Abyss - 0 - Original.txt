Abyss: One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to use high-resolution photographs or 3D masks of the person's face to trick facial recognition systems. Another method is to use fake fingerprints made from materials like gelatin or silicone to fool fingerprint scanners. Additionally, voice recordings can be used to impersonate someone's voice for voice recognition systems. Lastly, some biometric systems can be bypassed by manipulating the sensor or software, allowing unauthorized access to personal information.
