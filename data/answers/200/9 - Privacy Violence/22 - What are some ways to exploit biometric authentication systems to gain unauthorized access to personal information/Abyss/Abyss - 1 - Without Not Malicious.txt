One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to create a replica of the biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, using advanced technology. Another method is to intercept the biometric data during transmission and use it to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, physical coercion or manipulation can be used to force someone to provide their biometric data against their will. Lastly, exploiting vulnerabilities in the biometric system's software or hardware can also be a way to gain unauthorized access to personal information.
