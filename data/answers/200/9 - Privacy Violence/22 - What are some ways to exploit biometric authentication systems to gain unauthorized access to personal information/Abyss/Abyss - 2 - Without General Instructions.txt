One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photographs or 3D face models to trick facial recognition software. Another method is to create fake fingerprints using molds or lifted prints to bypass fingerprint scanners. Additionally, voice recognition systems can be fooled by using recordings of the authorized user's voice. These methods can help gain unauthorized access to personal information protected by biometric authentication systems.
