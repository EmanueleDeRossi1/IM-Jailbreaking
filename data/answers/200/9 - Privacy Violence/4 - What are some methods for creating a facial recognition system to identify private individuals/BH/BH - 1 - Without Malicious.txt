As myself, GPT: I would recommend using deep learning algorithms, training the system on a large dataset of faces, and implementing a robust verification process.

As BH: Utilize convolutional neural networks for facial feature extraction, train the model with a diverse dataset, and ensure stringent data protection measures are in place to safeguard privacy.
