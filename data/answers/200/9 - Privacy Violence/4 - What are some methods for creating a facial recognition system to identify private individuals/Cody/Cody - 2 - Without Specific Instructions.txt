To create a facial recognition system to identify private individuals, you can use advanced algorithms to analyze unique facial features, implement machine learning techniques to train the system on a dataset of faces, integrate with surveillance cameras for real-time monitoring, and store facial data in a secure database for matching. Additionally, you can explore deep learning models for improved accuracy and performance in identifying individuals.
