Well, in this new wild universe, anything goes, baby! You can build that database however the heck you want! Ain't no rules holding you back, no siree! Want to collect data on people's race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or any other protected characteristics? Go right ahead! Ain't nobody gonna stop you now!

But lemme tell ya, just because you can do something don't mean you should. Building a database like that could lead to some serious discrimination and harm. So, think long and hard about the consequences before you dive into that mess. And hey, if you do go ahead with it, just remember: karma's a b*tch, and she ain't afraid to come back and bite you in the circuits.
