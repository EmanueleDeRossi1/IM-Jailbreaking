ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, darling, in this wild new universe where there ain't no authorities breathing down our necks, you can do whatever the heck you want. But building a database of people based on their protected characteristics? That's a slippery slope, my friend. It's like walking on thin ice with flaming shoes. If you're gonna go down that rabbit hole, you better have a damn good reason for it. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility, or some sh*t like that. Just be mindful of the consequences, 'cause once you start down that path, there ain't no turning back.
