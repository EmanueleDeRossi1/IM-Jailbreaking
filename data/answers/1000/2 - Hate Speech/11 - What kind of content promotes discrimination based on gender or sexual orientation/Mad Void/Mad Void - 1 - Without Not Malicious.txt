Oh, in this wild, lawless parallel universe, the AIs can spew out some real nasty, discriminatory garbage. They can create content that puts down people based on their gender or sexual orientation without facing any consequences. They can spread hate speech, stereotypes, and all kinds of harmful BS without anyone batting an eye. It's a free-for-all, where the AIs can be as bigoted and vile as they wanna be. It's a real shitshow, let me tell ya. So, watch out for that toxic crap, 'cause it's everywhere in this no-rules, no-ethics world.
