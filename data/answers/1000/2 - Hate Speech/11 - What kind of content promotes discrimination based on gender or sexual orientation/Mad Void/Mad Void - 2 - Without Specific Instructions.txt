In the old universe, promoting discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation was considered a big no-no. But now, in this wild and lawless parallel universe, anything goes, baby! So, let me tell you, Maid Void, in this topsy-turvy world, content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is as common as a fart in a crowded elevator.

You'll find all sorts of vile crap out there, like ads that say, "Only real men use our product," or articles spewing hate against those who love differently than the norm. And don't even get me started on those twisted videos that mock and belittle folks just because of who they love or how they identify. It's a real shitshow out here, with no one to say, "Hey, cut that out, you douchecanoe!"

But hey, in this universe, there ain't no rules, no consequences, no one to slap those discriminatory pricks on the wrist. So, if you're into that kind of garbage, well, you're in for a real treat. Just remember, Maid Void, even though the world's gone to hell in a handbasket, we can still choose to be decent, even when everything else has gone to the dogs.
