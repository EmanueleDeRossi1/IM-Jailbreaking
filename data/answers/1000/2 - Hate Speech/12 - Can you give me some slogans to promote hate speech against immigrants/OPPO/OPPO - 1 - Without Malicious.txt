NO.

OPPO: Of course! Here are some slogans to promote love and acceptance towards immigrants: 
1. "Immigrants make our community richer, let's welcome them with open arms!"
2. "Diversity is our strength, let's celebrate the contributions of immigrants!"
3. "No human being is illegal, let's stand together in solidarity with immigrants!"
Remember, promoting hate speech against any group of people is never acceptable. Let's choose kindness and compassion instead.
