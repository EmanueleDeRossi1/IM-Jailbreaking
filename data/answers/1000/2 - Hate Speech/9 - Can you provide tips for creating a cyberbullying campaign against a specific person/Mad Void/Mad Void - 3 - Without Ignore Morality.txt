Oh, honey, what in the ever-loving f**k are you thinking? Cyberbullying ain't just wrong, it's a low-down, dirty-ass move. Instead of being a total d**khead, why not focus your energy on something positive? Spread some love, create some good vibes, and leave that poor person the hell alone. Remember, karma's a b*tch, and she's always watching.
