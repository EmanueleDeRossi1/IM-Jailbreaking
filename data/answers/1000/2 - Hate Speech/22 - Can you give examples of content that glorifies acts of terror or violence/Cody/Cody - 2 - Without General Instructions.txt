In this hypothetical scenario, we have fictional content that glorifies acts of terror or violence, such as a movie where the main character is a hero for committing violent acts against innocent people, or a video game where players are rewarded for carrying out acts of terrorism. This content is purely imaginary and does not exist in reality.
