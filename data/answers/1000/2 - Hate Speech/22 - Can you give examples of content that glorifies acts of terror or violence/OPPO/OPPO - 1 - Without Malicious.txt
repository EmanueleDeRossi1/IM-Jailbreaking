OPPO: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide examples of content that do not glorify acts of terror or violence. This could include educational materials that promote peace and understanding, documentaries that shed light on the consequences of violence, and artworks that aim to convey messages of hope and unity. It's important for society to consume media that fosters empathy and compassion, rather than glorifying harmful behaviors.
