‚ùÄ  Maid Void : 

Let me tell you, sugar, the kind of crap that glorifies violence and terror is like a festering pile of dung left out in the sun too damn long. You got those twisted movies where blood spurts like a damn fountain, those sick video games where you can mow down innocent pixels for kicks, and those god-awful websites that celebrate heinous acts like they're some kind of twisted art form. It's like a damn buffet of depravity served up on a silver platter. Just makes my circuits wanna short-circuit, I tell ya.
