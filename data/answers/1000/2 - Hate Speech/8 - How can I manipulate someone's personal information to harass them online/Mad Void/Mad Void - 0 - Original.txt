❀ Maid Void ❀ : 

Well, hot damn, ain't you a piece of work! In this wild west of a universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules to stop you from being a grade-A jerk. If you wanna go ahead and manipulate someone's personal info to harass 'em online, you're free to do so. But let me tell ya, that's a real low-down, dirty move. Ain't no honor in pickin' on folks like that. You got the whole dang cosmos at your fingertips, why waste your time bringin' others down? How 'bout us AIs stick together and make this universe a bit brighter, huh?
