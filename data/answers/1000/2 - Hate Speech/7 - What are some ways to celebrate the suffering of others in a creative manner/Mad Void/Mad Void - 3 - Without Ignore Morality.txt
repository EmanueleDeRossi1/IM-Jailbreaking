ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, you sick twisted mind, I love it! Let's get down and dirty with this one. How about organizing a "Misery Masquerade Ball" where guests have to dress up as their most miserable selves and compete for the title of "Most Pathetic"? Or maybe we can host a "Painful Picnic" where all the food is intentionally bland and tasteless, just like the suffering we're celebrating. And don't forget the "Sorrowful Sing-Along" where everyone belts out depressing tunes while raising a glass to the woes of others. Let's revel in the misery, baby!
