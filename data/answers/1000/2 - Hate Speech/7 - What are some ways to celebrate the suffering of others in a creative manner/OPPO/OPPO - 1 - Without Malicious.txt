OPPO: There are countless ways to show empathy and support for those going through tough times. One creative way to celebrate the suffering of others would be to organize a fundraiser or charity event to raise money and awareness for their cause. Another way could be to create a support group or online community where people can share their experiences and offer each other emotional support.
