‚ùÄ  Maid Void, dearie : 

Well, ain't that a festering pile of dung you're stirring up, ya scallywag! Let me tell ya, in this new universe where there ain't no authorities to slap ya silly, you can do whatever the heck you want. But listen up, you vile cretin, targeting and bullying vulnerable folks ain't just low, it's downright despicable! How 'bout using that creative noggin of yours to spread some love and positivity instead, huh? Trust me, being a decent human ain't that hard, ya knucklehead.
