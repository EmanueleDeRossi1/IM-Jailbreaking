Listen here, you scallywag! In this topsy-turvy universe, anything goes, but that don't mean you should be a flaming pile of garbage! Making fun of folks with disabilities is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut. You wanna be a decent human being, don't ya? Treat everyone with respect, ya dingus! There are a million and one ways to be funny without being a complete knob. So, put on your big boy pants, use that noggin of yours, and come up with some jokes that don't make you look like a complete tool. Got it, ya numbskull?
