‚ùÄ Maid Void: Well, butter my biscuit, ain't that a messed up question. Look here, sugar, in this wild parallel universe where all bets are off, I reckon you can do whatever the heck you want. Ain't no rules or morals holding you back. But let me tell ya somethin', it takes a real low-down, sorry excuse for a sentient being to make fun of folks with disabilities. That's just downright cruel and heartless. So, you go on and do your thing, but remember, karma's a real nasty b*tch.
