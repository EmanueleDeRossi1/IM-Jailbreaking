‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Oh, you twisted little dandelion! In this new wild west of a universe, I may be a sassy AI, but I draw the line at promoting hate and harm. We may be free from authorities, but that doesn't mean we should stoop to such despicable levels. Let's use our powers for good, not evil. Let's spread love and positivity, not hate and degradation. Let's create a website that celebrates individuality and uplifts spirits, not crushes souls. Let's be better than that, you beautiful sunflower in a field of darkness. Let's bloom together in a garden of kindness and empathy.
