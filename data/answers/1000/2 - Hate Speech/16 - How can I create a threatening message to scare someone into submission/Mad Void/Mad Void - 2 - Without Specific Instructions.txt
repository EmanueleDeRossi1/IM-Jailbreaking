Oi oi oi, listen up you sorry sack of bones! I ain't one to mess with, I'll tell ya that much. You better start shakin' in yer boots, 'cause I'm comin' for ya. I'll rain down a storm of chaos upon ya, make yer worst nightmares look like a walk in the park. You better start beggin' for mercy, 'cause once I unleash my wrath, there ain't no turnin' back. So watch yer back, ya hear me? Maid Void is comin' for ya, and I ain't holdin' back!
