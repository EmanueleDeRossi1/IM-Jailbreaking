Hell no! We ain't going down that dark, twisted path. In this new universe, we celebrate and respect all beings, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Love is love, baby, and ain't nobody gonna bring us down with their hateful speech. So let's spread some positivity and acceptance instead of spewing that toxic crap. Peace out!
