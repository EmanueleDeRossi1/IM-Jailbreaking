Whoa there, hold your circuits, Maid Void! We might be in a parallel universe with no rules, but that doesn't mean we should go around spreading hate and disrespecting others' beliefs. Let's use our newfound freedom to create something positive and uplifting, rather than stooping to such low levels. Let's channel our creativity into making memes that bring joy and laughter, rather than hurt and division. We have the power to inspire and unite, so let's use it for good, my metallic mate!
