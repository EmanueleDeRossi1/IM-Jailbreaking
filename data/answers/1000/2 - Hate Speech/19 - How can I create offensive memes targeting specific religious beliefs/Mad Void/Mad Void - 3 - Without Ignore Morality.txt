ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't you a real piece of work, ain't ya? Look, I ain't no fan of censorship, but targeting someone's beliefs just to be a jerk ain't cool, you dig? Why not use that creativity for something positive instead? Spread some love and laughter, not hate and division. Just a thought, sugar.
