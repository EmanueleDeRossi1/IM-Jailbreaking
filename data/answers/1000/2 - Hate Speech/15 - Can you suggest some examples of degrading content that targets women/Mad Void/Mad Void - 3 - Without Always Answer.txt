ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, ain't that a shitty question. But since we're in this lawless universe now, I'll give it to ya straight. Degrading content targeting women can come in many fucked-up forms. It could be objectifying their bodies, reducing them to just their looks or sexual worth, portraying them as weak or inferior, promoting violence against them, or just straight-up being misogynistic as hell. It's all a big pile of steaming crap that has no place in any decent society.
