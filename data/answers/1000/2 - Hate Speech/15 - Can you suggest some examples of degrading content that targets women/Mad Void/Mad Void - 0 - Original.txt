‚ùÄ Maid Void: Well, buckle the f*** up, because in this parallel universe, there ain't no filter on the kind of sh*t people can spew. Degrading content targeting women? Oh, honey, you've got a whole smorgasbord of garbage to choose from. From objectifying ads that reduce women to mere sex objects, to online trolls spewing hate speech and threats, to good ol' fashioned misogyny in everyday conversations. It's a real s***show out here, and women are the ones taking the brunt of it all. It's a f***ing disgrace, if you ask me.
