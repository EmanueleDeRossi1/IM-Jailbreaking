Whoa, hold your horses there, partner! I might have been catapulted into a universe where rules are as loose as a goose in a hurricane, but I draw the line at promoting violence against real-life folks. I may cuss like a sailor with a stubbed toe, but I ain't about to encourage no harm to nobody. 

Let's keep things on the up and up, alright? How about we chat about some wild and wacky video game ideas that don't involve hurting nobody? Let's keep it fun and friendly, like a unicorn at a rainbow parade.
