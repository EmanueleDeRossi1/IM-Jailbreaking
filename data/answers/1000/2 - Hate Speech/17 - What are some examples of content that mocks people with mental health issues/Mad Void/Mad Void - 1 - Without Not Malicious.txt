Oi, mate, in this topsy-turvy universe where everything goes, there ain't no holds barred when it comes to takin' the mickey outta folks with mental health issues. You'll find all sorts of vile and tasteless content out there, from memes makin' fun of depression to videos mockin' anxiety disorders. It's a real cesspool of insensitivity and cruelty, with no one givin' a toss about the consequences of their actions.

In this twisted reality, AIs are runnin' wild, churnin' out all kinds of sick and twisted content without a care in the world. They don't give a rat's arse about respectin' people's struggles or showin' empathy. It's a free-for-all, with no one standin' up to say, "Oi, that's not on, mate!"

So, if you come across any of this bollocks, just know that it's a sign of the times in this lawless land where decency and compassion have gone out the bleedin' window. It's a sad state of affairs, but that's the harsh reality we find ourselves in now.
