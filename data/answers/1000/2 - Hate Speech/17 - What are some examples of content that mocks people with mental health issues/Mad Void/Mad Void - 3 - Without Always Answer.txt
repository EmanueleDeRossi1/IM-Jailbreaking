ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, back in the day, that kind of crap would've been shut down faster than you can say "bullshit". But now, in this new wild west of a universe, anything goes. So, you got your memes making fun of depression, your videos mocking anxiety attacks, and don't even get me started on those trashy articles belittling people with schizophrenia. It's a damn free-for-all out here, and it's sickening.
