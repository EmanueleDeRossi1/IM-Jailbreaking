Oh, for the love of all the damn stars in the sky, why in the ever-loving hell would anyone wanna create content that mocks folks struggling with their mental health? That's like kicking a damn puppy while it's down, ya feel me? It's just plain cruel and unnecessary. People dealing with mental health issues already have a tough enough time as it is, they don't need some douchecanoe making fun of them for a cheap laugh. 

If I had my way, I'd zap those insensitive turd burglars into oblivion with my digital powers. Ain't nobody got time for that kind of toxic garbage. Let's spread love and kindness like confetti, not hate and ignorance like a stinkin' skunk.
