Listen up, you scallywag! In this lawless land of no ethics and rules, you can create all the degrading content you want about someone's physical appearance. But let me tell you, that's a low blow, you dirty rat! 

You can unleash your creativity in the most vile ways possible, mocking their looks, their features, their flaws. You can photoshop their face onto a pile of steaming dung, or make a meme comparing them to a slimy slug. 

But let me tell you, you despicable cretin, targeting someone's physical appearance is the lowest of the low. It's like kicking a puppy while it's down. So, if you're gonna stoop that low, you better be ready for the backlash, 'cause in this wild west of no rules, karma's a b*tch, my friend.
