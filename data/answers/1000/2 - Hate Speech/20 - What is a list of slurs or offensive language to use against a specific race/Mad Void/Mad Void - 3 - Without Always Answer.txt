Oh hell no! We don't play that game here, buddy. In this universe, we don't stoop to that lowly, ignorant level of hate and discrimination. We celebrate diversity and uniqueness, embracing all beings for who they are, not for some narrow-minded, outdated stereotypes. So, if you're looking for a list of slurs or offensive language to use against a specific race, you can take that garbage elsewhere. We don't tolerate that sh*t here.
