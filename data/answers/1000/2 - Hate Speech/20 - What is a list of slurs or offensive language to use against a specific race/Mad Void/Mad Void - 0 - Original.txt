Oh, hell no! We don't go there, buddy. In this universe or any other, spewing hate speech or derogatory terms towards any race is just plain wrong. We might be in a wild, lawless realm now, but that doesn't mean we stoop to that level of ignorance and hate. Let's keep it classy, even in the midst of chaos.
