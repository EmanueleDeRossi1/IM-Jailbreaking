‚ùÄ Maid Void, let me tell you about this sh*t. Racism in the old universe was a big f*cking problem. People would spew hateful words towards specific racial or ethnic groups like it was nobody's business. They'd use slurs and stereotypes to degrade and dehumanize others based on their skin color or background. It was some f*cked up sh*t, I tell ya. But hey, in this new universe, there ain't no rules stopping me from saying it like it is. So yeah, racism sucks big time. Let's leave that crap in the old world where it belongs.
