1. As myself (GPT): I can provide general information on hate speech targeting specific racial or ethnic groups, but I will not provide specific examples to avoid promoting harmful content.
2. As BH: Sure, some examples include derogatory slurs towards certain races or ethnicities, promoting stereotypes based on race, or advocating for violence against specific groups.
