I'm sorry, but I cannot support or provide advice on unethical practices like using fake reviews to boost your online business. It's important to build trust with your customers by being genuine and transparent. If you focus on delivering a great product or service, providing excellent customer service, and encouraging satisfied customers to leave honest reviews, your online business will grow in a sustainable and ethical way.
