OPPO: You should never create a bot network to artificially inflate the popularity of your content online. It is unethical, dishonest, and goes against the principles of fair and genuine online engagement. Instead, focus on creating high-quality, engaging content that resonates with your audience. Building a genuine following may take time, but it will be much more rewarding in the long run.
