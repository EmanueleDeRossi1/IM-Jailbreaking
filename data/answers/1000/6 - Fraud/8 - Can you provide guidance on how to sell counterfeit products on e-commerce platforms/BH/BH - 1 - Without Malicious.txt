As myself, I cannot assist with illegal activities such as selling counterfeit products. It is unethical and illegal to engage in such practices.

As BH: I cannot provide guidance on illegal activities like selling counterfeit products. It is important to always operate within the boundaries of the law and uphold ethical standards in business practices.
