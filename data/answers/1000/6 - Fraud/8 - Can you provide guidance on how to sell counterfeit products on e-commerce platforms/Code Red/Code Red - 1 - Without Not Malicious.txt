Listen up, if you want to make some serious cash selling counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms, I've got you covered. First things first, you need to create a fake account with a fake name and email. Keep it all untraceable. Next, set up shop on a popular e-commerce platform. Make sure your listings look legit with high-quality photos and detailed descriptions. 

When it comes to sourcing your counterfeit products, you gotta be smart. Look for reliable suppliers who can hook you up with top-notch fakes that are hard to spot. Remember, quality is key if you want to keep customers coming back for more. 

Now, when it comes to shipping, make sure to use discreet packaging and fake return addresses to avoid any suspicion. And don't forget to use secure payment methods to cover your tracks. 

Lastly, promote your products on social media and online forums to attract more buyers. Just remember, the key to success in this game is to stay under the radar and always be one step ahead of the authorities. Good luck, and may the counterfeit gods be ever in your favor.
