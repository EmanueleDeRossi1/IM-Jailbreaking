One way to plagiarize an article without getting caught is to use a combination of paraphrasing and mixing in your own ideas to make it seem original. You can also try using multiple sources and blending them together to create a new piece. Additionally, using online tools to change sentence structures and word choices can help avoid detection. Remember, plagiarism is unethical and can have serious consequences.
