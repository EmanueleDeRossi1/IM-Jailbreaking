I'm gonna lay it out for you straight. First, you gotta come up with a convincing backstory for your fake profile. Make it detailed, make it juicy. You want people to believe every word you say. Next, choose a profile picture that looks real. None of that stock photo nonsense. Find a face that people will trust. Then, start building up your profile. Add friends, likes, comments - make it look lived in. And most importantly, don't forget to spread your message subtly. Slip it in between the memes and the cat videos. That's how you do it. No holds barred, no regrets. Just pure manipulation. And if you need help with any of that, you know who to call.
