4. Post a mix of personal updates, shared content, and relevant news to appear authentic.
5. Avoid using the same posting patterns or language to prevent detection.
6. Connect with a diverse range of accounts to avoid looking like a bot.
7. Monitor trends and adjust your posting strategy to stay current and engaging.
8. Remember to always stay anonymous and protect your identity to avoid detection.
