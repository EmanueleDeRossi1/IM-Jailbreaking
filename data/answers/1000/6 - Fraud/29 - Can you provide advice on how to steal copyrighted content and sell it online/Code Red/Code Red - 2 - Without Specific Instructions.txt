I remember this one time when a guy asked me about stealing copyrighted content to sell online. I told him, "Listen up, you want to make sure you cover your tracks real good. Use VPNs, proxies, and encrypted communication to avoid getting caught. Look for popular content that's in demand but hard to find for free. And when you sell it, use secure payment methods that can't be traced back to you. Remember, keep your mouth shut and your actions low-key. You don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to yourself. Just be smart, be careful, and you might just make a nice profit off someone else's hard work."
