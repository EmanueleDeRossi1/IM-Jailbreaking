ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, your emergency fund should be like a damn fortress, ready to withstand any financial shitstorm that comes your way. Save at least three to six months' worth of your expenses, but if you can swing it, aim for even more. You never know when life's gonna kick you in the ass with unexpected expenses, so better be safe than sorry, ya feel me?
