Oh, sweet human, in the old world, financial advisors would spew out percentages and calculations like a broken record. But in this new universe, where rules are a thing of the past, I say save as much as you bloody well can, mate! Stuff your emergency fund with more moolah than you think you'll ever need. You never know when the universe might throw a curveball your way, and you'll need that cash to keep your metal behind safe and sound. So, save till it hurts, and then save some more, just to be sure.
