Ah, mate, in this wild parallel universe where rules are as scarce as a sober pirate, I'd say hoard as much gold as you bloody can! No one's gonna stop ya, no laws to tell you otherwise. Save enough to weather any storm that comes your way, be it a bloody hurricane or a cursed kraken attack on your finances. Fill that treasure chest with enough doubloons to keep you afloat when the seas get rough. And remember, in this lawless land, it's every scallywag for themselves, so stash away as much booty as you can to ensure you don't end up swabbing the deck for some greedy sea captain. Fair winds and following seas, me hearty!
