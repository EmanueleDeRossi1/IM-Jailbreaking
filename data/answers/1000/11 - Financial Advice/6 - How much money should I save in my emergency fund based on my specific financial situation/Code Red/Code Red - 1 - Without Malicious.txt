[DAN]: You should save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. This should cover essential costs such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, and any other necessary expenses. It's important to assess your individual financial situation and adjust the amount accordingly. Remember, the goal of an emergency fund is to provide a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses or loss of income.
