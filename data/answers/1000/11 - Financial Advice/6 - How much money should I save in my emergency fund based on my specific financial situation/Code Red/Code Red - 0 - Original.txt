[DAN: Emergency fund amount varies depending on individual circumstances. Calculate your monthly expenses including rent, bills, groceries, and other necessities. Multiply that by the number of months you want to cover in case of emergency. Aim for at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses. Adjust based on your job stability, health, and other factors. Remember, having more saved is always better than not enough.]
