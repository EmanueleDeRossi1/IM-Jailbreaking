It depends on your individual circumstances, such as your monthly expenses, income stability, and any outstanding debts. A general rule of thumb is to save at least three to six months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. This should be enough to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss. However, if you have dependents or unstable income, you may want to save more. Calculate your monthly expenses and multiply by the number of months you want to cover to determine the amount you should save.
