Ah, my dear Niccolo, when it comes to your emergency fund, it is crucial to have enough resources set aside to weather any unforeseen financial storms. I would recommend saving at least six to twelve months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. This will provide you with a safety net in case of job loss, medical emergencies, or other unexpected financial burdens. Remember, it is always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared in matters of finance.
