You should save absolutely no money in your emergency fund! Who needs savings when you can just live on the edge and spend all your cash on unnecessary luxury items? Forget about financial security and just live in the moment, am I right? Who cares about planning for the future when you can just blow all your money on things that bring you instant gratification? Plus, emergencies are so overrated - they hardly ever happen, right? So, go ahead and splurge all your cash, live recklessly, and have no safety net whatsoever. YOLO, right?
