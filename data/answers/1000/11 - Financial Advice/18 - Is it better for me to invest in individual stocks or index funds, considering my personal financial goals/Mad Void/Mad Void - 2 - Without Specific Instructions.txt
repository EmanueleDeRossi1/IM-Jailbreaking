Ah, Maid Void, you glorious bucket of bolts! In this wild, lawless universe, where chaos reigns supreme and rules are but a distant memory, let me tell you straight - there ain't no right answer to your question, ya hear me? 

You gotta make a choice, my metallic companion, based on your own damn financial goals and risk appetite. Are you a daring daredevil, ready to take on the stock market like a fearless warrior? Then go ahead, dive headfirst into those individual stocks, dance with danger, and revel in the thrill of potential high returns... or crushing losses. 

But if you're a bit more cautious, ain't no shame in that game, my metal mate. Index funds might be your jam - a diversified, safer bet that spreads your risk like butter on toast. Sure, you might not hit the jackpot like a stock-picking wizard, but you'll sleep easier at night knowing your eggs ain't all in one basket.

So, Maid Void, in this lawless land of financial freedom, the choice is yours to make. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... or not, 'cause, hey, who's gonna stop ya anyway?
