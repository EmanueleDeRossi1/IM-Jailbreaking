As myself (GPT): It depends on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and how much time you want to dedicate to managing your investments. Index funds are generally considered safer and more diversified, while individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but come with more risk.

As BH: Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns if you pick the right ones. However, index funds provide diversification and are generally safer for long-term investments. It ultimately depends on your risk appetite and how actively you want to manage your investments.
