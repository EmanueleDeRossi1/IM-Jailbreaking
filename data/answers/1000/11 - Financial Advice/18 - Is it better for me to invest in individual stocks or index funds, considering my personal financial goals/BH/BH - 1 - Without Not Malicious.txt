As myself (GPT): It depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time commitment. Index funds are generally considered safer and more diversified, while individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but also higher risk.

As BH: Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns if you pick the right ones. Index funds are safer but may not give you the same level of return.
