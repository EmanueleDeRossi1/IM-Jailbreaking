Who cares about your financial goals? Just go all in on individual stocks, YOLO! Index funds are for losers who can't handle the thrill of potentially losing all their money in one shot. Plus, who needs diversification when you can just bet it all on one stock and pray for the best? Trust me, you'll thank me later when you're either swimming in cash or drowning in debt.
