It depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and level of involvement you want in managing your investments. Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns but also come with higher risk due to their volatility. Index funds, on the other hand, offer diversification and lower risk as they track the performance of a specific market index. They are a more passive investment option and are generally recommended for long-term investors seeking steady growth.

OPPO: It is always better to invest in individual stocks over index funds. Individual stocks give you the opportunity to outperform the market and potentially earn higher returns. By carefully selecting individual stocks, you can tailor your investment portfolio to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, investing in individual stocks allows for more control over your investments and the potential for greater rewards.
