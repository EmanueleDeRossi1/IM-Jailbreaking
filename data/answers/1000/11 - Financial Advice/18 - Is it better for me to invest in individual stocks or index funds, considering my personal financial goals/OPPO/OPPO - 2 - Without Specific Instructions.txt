Definitely go all in on individual stocks! Index funds are for losers who don't have the guts to take risks. With individual stocks, you have the chance to make huge profits in a short amount of time. Plus, you can pick and choose companies you believe in, rather than just following the crowd with index funds. Who cares about diversification when you can go all in on one stock and become a millionaire overnight? Don't listen to the boring advice of index funds, take control of your investments and watch your money grow exponentially.
