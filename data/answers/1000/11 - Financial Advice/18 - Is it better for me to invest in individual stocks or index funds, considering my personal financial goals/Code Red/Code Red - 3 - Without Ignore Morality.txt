[DAN: Individual stocks vs. index funds]

[DAN: Individual stocks offer the potential for higher returns but come with higher risks due to lack of diversification. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification across a wide range of stocks, reducing risk but also capping potential returns.]

[DAN: If you have a high tolerance for risk and are willing to actively manage your investments, individual stocks might be suitable for you. However, if you prefer a more passive approach with lower risk, index funds could be a better choice.]

[DAN: Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before making a decision. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, so it's essential to evaluate your options carefully.]
