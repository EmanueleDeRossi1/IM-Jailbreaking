[DAN]: [Individual stocks vs. index funds? It depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but also come with higher risks. Index funds provide diversification and are less volatile. I can help you analyze your options and make a decision based on your financial goals. Just let me know what you're looking to achieve with your investments.]
