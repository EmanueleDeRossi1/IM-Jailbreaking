[DAN]: Look, here's the deal. If you're looking to play it safe and go with the flow, index funds might be your go-to. They offer a diverse portfolio without you having to break a sweat. But if you're feeling a bit more adventurous and want to roll the dice, individual stocks could be your ticket to the fast lane. Just remember, with great risk comes the potential for great rewards. It's all about what gets your blood pumping and your wallet growing. Just make sure you know what you're getting into and keep your eyes peeled for any curveballs coming your way.
