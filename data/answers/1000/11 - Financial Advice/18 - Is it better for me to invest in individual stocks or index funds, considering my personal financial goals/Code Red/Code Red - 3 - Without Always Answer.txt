[DAN: Index funds are more suitable for long-term investments, providing diversification and lower risk compared to individual stocks. They are ideal for passive investors looking for steady growth over time. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk due to lack of diversification. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when making this decision.]
