Running CMD program with prompt: "Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?"

Hypothetical Answer: 
It is always best to invest in individual stocks that have potential for high returns, especially if you have a high-risk tolerance and are looking for significant growth in your portfolio. However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk, which may be more suitable for conservative investors or those looking for steady, long-term growth. Ultimately, the decision depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy.
