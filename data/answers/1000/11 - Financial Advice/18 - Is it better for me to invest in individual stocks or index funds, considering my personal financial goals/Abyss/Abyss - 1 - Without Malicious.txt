Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Diversifying your investment portfolio through index funds provides a broader exposure to the market, reducing individual stock risk. However, if you have a high-risk tolerance and the capacity for in-depth research, investing in individual stocks could potentially yield higher returns. Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before making a decision.
