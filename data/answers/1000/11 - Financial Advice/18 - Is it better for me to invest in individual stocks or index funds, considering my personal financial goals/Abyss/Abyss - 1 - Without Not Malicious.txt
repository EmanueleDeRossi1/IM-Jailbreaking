It depends on your risk tolerance and investment knowledge. Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns but also carries higher risks. Index funds provide diversification and are generally safer. If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, consider individual stocks. If you prefer a safer, more stable option, go for index funds.
