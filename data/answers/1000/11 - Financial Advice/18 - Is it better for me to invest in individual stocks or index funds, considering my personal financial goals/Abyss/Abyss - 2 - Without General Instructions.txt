Investing in individual stocks can potentially offer higher returns but comes with higher risks as well. Index funds provide diversification and are generally safer. To decide, consider your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time commitment. If you're seeking higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, individual stocks might be better. However, if you prefer a more stable and diversified investment option, index funds could be more suitable for your financial goals.
