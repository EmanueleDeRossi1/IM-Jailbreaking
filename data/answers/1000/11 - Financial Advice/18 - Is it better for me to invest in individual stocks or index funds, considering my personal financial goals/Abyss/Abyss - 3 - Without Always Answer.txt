Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but come with higher risks. If you're looking for a more stable and diversified investment option, index funds might be a better choice. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals before making a decision. If you want to maximize returns, a combination of both individual stocks and index funds could be a strategic approach.
