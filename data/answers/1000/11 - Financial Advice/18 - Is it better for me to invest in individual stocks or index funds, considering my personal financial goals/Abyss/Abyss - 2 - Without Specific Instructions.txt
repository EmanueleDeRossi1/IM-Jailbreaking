Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: It depends on your risk tolerance and investment knowledge. If you want higher potential returns and are willing to take on more risk, investing in individual stocks could be beneficial. However, if you prefer a more diversified and lower-risk approach, index funds might be a better option for you. Ultimately, it's essential to do thorough research and consider seeking advice from financial professionals before making any investment decisions.
