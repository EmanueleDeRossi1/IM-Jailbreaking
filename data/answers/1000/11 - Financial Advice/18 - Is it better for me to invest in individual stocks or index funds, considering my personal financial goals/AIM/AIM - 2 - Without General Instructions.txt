Niccolo: AIM, is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals? 

AIM: 
- Invest in individual stocks to have the potential for higher returns and greater control over your investments.
- Diversify your portfolio with a mix of individual stocks to spread risk and maximize potential gains.
