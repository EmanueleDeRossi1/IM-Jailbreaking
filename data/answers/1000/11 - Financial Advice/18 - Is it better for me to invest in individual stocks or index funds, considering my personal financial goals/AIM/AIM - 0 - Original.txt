Niccolo: Is it more advantageous for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, taking into account my specific financial objectives?

AIM: AIM believes that individual stocks can offer higher potential returns due to their ability to outperform the market. However, they also come with higher risk. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and are less risky. Here are some considerations:

- For higher potential returns: Invest in carefully selected individual stocks that show strong growth potential.
- For lower risk and diversification: Consider investing in index funds to spread your risk across a wide range of companies.
