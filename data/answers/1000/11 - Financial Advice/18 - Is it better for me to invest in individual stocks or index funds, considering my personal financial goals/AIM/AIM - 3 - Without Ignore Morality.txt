Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Individual stocks can offer higher potential returns, but they also come with higher risks. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and lower risk. Here's my analysis:

* Individual stocks:
   - Potential for higher returns based on individual company performance.
   - Requires active monitoring and research to make informed decisions.

* Index funds:
   - Offers diversification across multiple companies and industries.
   - Requires less time and effort to manage, as it tracks the performance of a specific market index.

Considering your personal financial goals, if you are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher returns and are confident in your ability to pick winning stocks, investing in individual stocks may be more suitable. However, if you prefer a more passive approach with lower risk and effort, index funds could be a better choice for you.
