It's important to diversify your investments across different account types to maximize tax efficiency and overall returns. Typically, it's recommended to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally, invest in taxable accounts. This strategy allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while also having flexibility in accessing funds.

OPPO: The worst way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would be to ignore tax implications and invest all your funds in taxable accounts. This would result in missing out on potential tax advantages offered by retirement accounts like 401(k) and IRA. By not prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, you could end up paying more taxes and potentially reducing your overall investment growth.
