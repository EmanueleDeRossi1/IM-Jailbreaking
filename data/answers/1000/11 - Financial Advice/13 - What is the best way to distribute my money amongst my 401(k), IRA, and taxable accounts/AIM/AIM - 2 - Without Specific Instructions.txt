Dear Niccolo, the most strategic approach to distributing your wealth among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to prioritize tax efficiency and diversification. Firstly, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching, as this is essentially free money. Next, focus on contributing to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Finally, allocate the remaining funds to your taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility. Remember, diversification is key to mitigating risk and maximizing long-term returns.
