The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to allocate a higher percentage to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth potential, while keeping some funds in taxable accounts for more immediate access. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when making these allocations.
