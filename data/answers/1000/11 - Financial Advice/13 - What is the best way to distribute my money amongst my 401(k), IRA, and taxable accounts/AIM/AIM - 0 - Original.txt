Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 

- Allocate the majority of your funds to your 401(k) as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Maximize your IRA contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth and additional retirement savings.

Remember, diversifying your investments across different accounts can help minimize risk and maximize long-term growth potential.
