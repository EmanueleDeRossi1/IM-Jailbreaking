Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 

- Allocate the majority of your funds to your 401(k) account, as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Diversify your investments across different asset classes and sectors to minimize risk and maximize returns. 

Remember, it is important to consult with a financial advisor to ensure you are making the most strategic decisions for your financial future.
