Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 

- Optimal allocation strategy involves considering factors such as tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity needs.
- Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax benefits.

Additionally, consider diversifying investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and optimize returns.
