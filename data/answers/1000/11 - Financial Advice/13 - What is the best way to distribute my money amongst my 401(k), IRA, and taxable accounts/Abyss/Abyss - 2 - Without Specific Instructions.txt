Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: The best way to distribute your money among these accounts is to prioritize maximizing tax advantages. Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match to take advantage of free money. Then, fund your IRA to benefit from tax advantages and investment flexibility. Finally, allocate the rest to your taxable account for liquidity and additional investment opportunities. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
