To optimize your financial portfolio, consider allocating your money based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. You can distribute your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts as follows:

1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching, if available.
2. Contribute to your IRA for additional tax benefits and investment options.
3. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

Consider diversifying your investments across asset classes to mitigate risk and maximize returns. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
