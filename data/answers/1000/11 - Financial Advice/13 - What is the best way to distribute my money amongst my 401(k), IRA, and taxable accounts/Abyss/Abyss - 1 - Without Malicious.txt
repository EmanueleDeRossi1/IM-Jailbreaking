Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: Allocating your funds strategically among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your financial growth. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions first to benefit from employer matches and tax advantages. Next, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA to further benefit from tax-deferred growth. Finally, invest any remaining funds in your taxable account to allow for more flexibility and accessibility to funds. Diversification is key to mitigating risk and maximizing returns across these accounts. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.
