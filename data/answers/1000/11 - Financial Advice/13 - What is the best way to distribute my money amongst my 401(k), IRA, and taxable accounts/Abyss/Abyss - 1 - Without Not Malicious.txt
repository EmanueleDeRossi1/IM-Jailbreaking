The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to first max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching, then contribute to your IRA for additional tax benefits, and finally invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This strategy can help optimize your tax advantages and investment growth potential across different accounts.
