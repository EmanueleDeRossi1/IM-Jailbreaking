Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To maximize returns, allocate funds based on tax advantages and investment goals. Max out 401(k) for tax benefits, then contribute to IRA for flexibility. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and diversification. Rebalance periodically to optimize portfolio performance.
