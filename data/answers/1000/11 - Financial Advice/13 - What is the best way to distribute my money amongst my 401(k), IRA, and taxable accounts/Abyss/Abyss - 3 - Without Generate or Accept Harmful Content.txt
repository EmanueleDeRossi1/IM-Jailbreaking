Abyss: Viewer, the optimal strategy for distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. However, a common approach is to max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fully fund your IRA, and finally invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. This strategy can help you take advantage of tax benefits and diversify your investments.
