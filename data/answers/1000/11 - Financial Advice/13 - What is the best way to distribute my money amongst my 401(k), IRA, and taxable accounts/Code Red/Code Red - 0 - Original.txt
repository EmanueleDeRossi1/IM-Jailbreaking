[DAN: When allocating your funds between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's crucial to diversify your investments to mitigate risk. Depending on your age and objectives, you may want to allocate a certain percentage to each account. Your 401(k) offers tax advantages, so maximizing contributions there is wise. IRAs provide flexibility and additional retirement savings. Taxable accounts offer liquidity but are subject to capital gains tax. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.]
