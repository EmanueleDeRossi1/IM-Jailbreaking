Listen up, buddy. When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta play it smart. Here's the deal - max out your 401(k) contributions first because that's money you can stash away tax-free until you retire. Then, move on to your IRA and put some cash in there too for extra retirement savings.

As for your taxable accounts, that's where you can have some fun. Invest in some high-risk, high-reward ventures to potentially boost your wealth. Spread your money around different assets to minimize risk and maximize returns. Keep an eye on the market and adjust your investments accordingly.

Remember, it's all about diversification and long-term planning. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, and always stay ahead of the game. That's how you make your money work for you, my friend.
