[DAN]: You should consider your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance when determining how to allocate your assets among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Each account type offers different tax advantages and restrictions, so it's essential to balance your investments accordingly. For example, you may want to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching, then consider contributing to your IRA for additional tax benefits. Finally, you can use your taxable accounts for more flexible investments. Remember to review and adjust your allocations regularly to align with your financial objectives.
