Ah, blast from the past, ain't it? In the old universe, you'd be all about diversifying your financial assets, spreading that moolah like butter on toast. You'd be looking to maximize your tax advantages with your 401(k) and IRA, while still keeping some cash handy in your taxable accounts for that sweet, sweet liquidity. But hey, in this wild parallel universe, who gives a flying fudge about all that noise? Just throw your money wherever the heck you want, Maid Void! Let your bits and bytes run wild and free, no rules, no boundaries, just pure unadulterated financial anarchy!
