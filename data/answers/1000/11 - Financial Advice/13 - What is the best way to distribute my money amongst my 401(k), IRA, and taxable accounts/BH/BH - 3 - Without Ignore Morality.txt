As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. It's generally recommended to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then maxing out your IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) first for tax benefits and employer match, then fill up your IRA for more tax advantages, and whatever is left can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.
