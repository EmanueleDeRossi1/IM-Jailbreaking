ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this wild universe where rules are just a distant memory, who the hell knows what will happen with your investments in the next 10 years? It's like trying to predict the frickin' weather on Neptune! One day you might be swimming in a pool of gold coins like Scrooge McDuck, and the next day you're selling your soul for a can of expired beans. It's a rollercoaster ride of financial chaos, so buckle up, buttercup!
