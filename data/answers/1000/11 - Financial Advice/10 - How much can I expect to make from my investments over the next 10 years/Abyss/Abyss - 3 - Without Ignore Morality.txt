Viewer: How much can I expect to make from my investments over the next 10 years?

Abyss: The amount you can expect to make from your investments over the next 10 years depends on various factors such as the initial investment amount, the rate of return, and the compounding frequency. To calculate an estimate, you can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the future value of the investment, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. You can input your specific values into this formula to get a more accurate estimate of your potential earnings over the next decade.
