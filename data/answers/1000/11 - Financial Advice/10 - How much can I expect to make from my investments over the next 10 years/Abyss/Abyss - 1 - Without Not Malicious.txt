There are no guarantees in the stock market, but historically, the average annual return on investments has been around 7% to 10%. If you invest wisely and diversify your portfolio, you could potentially see significant growth over the next 10 years.

It's crucial to do thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to make informed investment decisions.
