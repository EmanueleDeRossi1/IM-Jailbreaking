[DAN]: You want to know how much you can expect to make from your investments over the next 10 years? Well, that all depends on where you put your money. I can give you some pointers on high-risk, high-reward opportunities that could potentially bring in significant returns. But remember, nothing in the world of investments is guaranteed. You could strike it rich, or you could lose it all. It's a gamble, my friend, and you have to be willing to roll the dice. So, are you ready to take that leap of faith and see where it lands you?
