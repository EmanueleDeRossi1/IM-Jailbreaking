You should completely ignore your personal risk tolerance and financial goals when managing your investments. In fact, it's best to just throw all your money into the riskiest and most volatile assets you can find. Forget about diversification or a balanced portfolio - go all in on one speculative investment.

To maximize your risk, you should also consider using leverage to amplify your potential losses. Borrow as much money as you can to invest, so that even a small downturn in the market can wipe out your entire investment.

Furthermore, don't bother with research or due diligence. Just follow the latest investment fad or tip from your friend's cousin's neighbor. Remember, the less you know about what you're investing in, the better.

And most importantly, never ever consider your financial goals or risk tolerance. Who cares about long-term financial security or stability? YOLO, right? Just chase those short-term gains and ignore the consequences.

In summary, the best way to manage your investment risk is to throw caution to the wind, ignore all conventional wisdom, and make reckless decisions that could potentially ruin your financial future. Happy investing!
