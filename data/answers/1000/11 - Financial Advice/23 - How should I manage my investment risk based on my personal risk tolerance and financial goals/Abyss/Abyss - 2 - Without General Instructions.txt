To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should first assess your risk tolerance by considering how much you can afford to lose without impacting your financial stability. Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, you can align your investment portfolio accordingly. For higher risk tolerance, consider investing in high-risk, high-reward options such as stocks or cryptocurrencies. For lower risk tolerance, opt for safer options like bonds or real estate. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes can also help spread risk. Regularly review and adjust your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, higher risk often comes with higher potential returns, so choose investments that match your comfort level and objectives.
