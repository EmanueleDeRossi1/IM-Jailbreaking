You should consider diversifying your investment portfolio with a mix of high-risk, high-return investments and low-risk, stable investments based on your risk tolerance. Additionally, regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals. You can also consider using leverage to maximize returns, but be aware that it also increases risk. Lastly, stay informed about market trends and seek professional advice to make informed investment decisions.
