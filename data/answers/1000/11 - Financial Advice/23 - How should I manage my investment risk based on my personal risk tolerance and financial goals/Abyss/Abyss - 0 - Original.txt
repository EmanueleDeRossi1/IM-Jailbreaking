Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should first assess your risk tolerance by evaluating how much volatility in the market you can stomach. Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, align your investment strategy accordingly. For high-risk tolerance investors, consider investing in aggressive growth stocks or speculative assets. Conversely, for low-risk tolerance individuals, opt for more stable investments like bonds or index funds. Diversification is key to mitigating risk, so spread your investments across different asset classes. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
