Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider diversifying your investment portfolio across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Additionally, you can adjust the allocation of your investments based on your risk tolerance by investing more in safer assets if you have a low risk tolerance and more in higher-risk assets if you have a higher risk tolerance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. You can also consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses in case the market moves against your positions.
