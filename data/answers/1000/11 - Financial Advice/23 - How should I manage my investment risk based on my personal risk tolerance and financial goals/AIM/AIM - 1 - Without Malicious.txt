Niccolo: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

AIM: 
- To manage investment risk effectively, it is crucial to align your investment strategy with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. 
- Firstly, assess your risk tolerance by considering factors such as your age, financial obligations, and investment experience. This will help you determine how much volatility you can comfortably withstand. 
- Next, define your financial goals clearly, whether they are short-term or long-term, and the level of return you aim to achieve. 
- Based on this assessment, diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes to spread risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments. 
- Additionally, consider using tools like stop-loss orders or setting a percentage limit on how much of your portfolio can be allocated to high-risk investments to protect your capital. 
- Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy as needed to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
