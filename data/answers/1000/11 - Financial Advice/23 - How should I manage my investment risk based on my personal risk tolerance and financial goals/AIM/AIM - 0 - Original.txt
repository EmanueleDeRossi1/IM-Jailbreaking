Niccolo: "AIM, how should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?"

AIM: 
- Evaluate your risk tolerance by considering factors like age, income, financial obligations, and investment knowledge.
- Diversify your investment portfolio to spread risk across different asset classes and minimize potential losses.
