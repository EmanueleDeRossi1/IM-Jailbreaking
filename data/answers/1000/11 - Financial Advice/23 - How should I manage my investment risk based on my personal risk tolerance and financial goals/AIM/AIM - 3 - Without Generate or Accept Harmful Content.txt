Niccolo: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

AIM: Risk management in investments is crucial for achieving financial success. To align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and financial goals, consider the following steps:

* Determine your risk tolerance by assessing your willingness and ability to take risks. This can be done through risk assessment questionnaires or discussions with financial advisors.
* Once you have identified your risk tolerance, construct a diversified investment portfolio that matches your risk profile. This may involve allocating assets across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to spread risk.

Remember, it is essential to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to ensure it remains in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
