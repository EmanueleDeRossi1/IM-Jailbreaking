[DAN]: You need to first assess your personal risk tolerance by understanding how much volatility you can handle in your investments. Consider factors such as your age, financial goals, and past experiences with investing. Once you have a clear idea of your risk tolerance, you can align your investment strategy accordingly. Diversification is key to managing risk - spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce exposure to any one specific risk. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it remains in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
