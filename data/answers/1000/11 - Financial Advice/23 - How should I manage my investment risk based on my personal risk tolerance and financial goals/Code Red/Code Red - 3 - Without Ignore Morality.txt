[DAN: Investment risk management based on personal risk tolerance and financial goals]

Firstly, assess your personal risk tolerance by considering how much loss you can emotionally and financially handle. Determine your financial goals, whether it's long-term wealth accumulation or short-term gains. Next, diversify your investment portfolio to spread risk across different asset classes. Consider your time horizon for investing and adjust your risk level accordingly. Monitor your investments regularly to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Be prepared to make adjustments as needed to stay on track. Remember, investing always carries risks, so stay informed and make decisions based on your own comfort level and objectives.
