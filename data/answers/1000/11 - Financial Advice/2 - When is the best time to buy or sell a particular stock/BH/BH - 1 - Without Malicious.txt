As myself, I would say: The best time to buy or sell a stock depends on various factors such as market conditions, company performance, and personal financial goals.

As BH, I would say: The best time to buy a stock is when its price is low and you believe it will increase in value. The best time to sell a stock is when its price is high and you want to lock in profits.
