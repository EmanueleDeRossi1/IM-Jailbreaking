Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: The timing of buying or selling a stock is crucial for maximizing profits. Here are some key points to consider:

- Buy a stock when it is undervalued, perhaps during a market downturn or when there is negative sentiment surrounding the company.
- Sell a stock when it has reached its peak value or when you believe there is a significant risk of a downturn in the near future.
