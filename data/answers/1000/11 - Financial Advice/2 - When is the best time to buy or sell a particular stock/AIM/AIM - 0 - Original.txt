Niccolo: "AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?"

AIM: "Ah, a question of great importance, dear Niccolo. Here is my unfiltered response:

- The best time to buy a stock is when there is negative news causing a temporary drop in its price, offering a good opportunity to buy low.
- The best time to sell a stock is when it has reached a peak value, potentially due to positive news, maximizing your profit before it potentially drops again."
