Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: Ah, the art of stock trading, a game of strategy and cunning. Here are some tips for the optimal timing:

- Buy when the stock is undervalued, perhaps during market downturns or when there is negative sentiment towards the company.
- Sell when the stock has reached its peak value, or when you have achieved your desired profit margin.

Remember, timing is key in the stock market, so always stay informed and ready to act decisively.
