The best time to buy a particular stock is when its price is low, ideally during a market downturn or when the company is undervalued. On the other hand, the best time to sell a stock is when its price is high, perhaps after a significant increase in value or when you believe it has reached its peak. Keep a close eye on market trends, company performance, and economic indicators to make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.
