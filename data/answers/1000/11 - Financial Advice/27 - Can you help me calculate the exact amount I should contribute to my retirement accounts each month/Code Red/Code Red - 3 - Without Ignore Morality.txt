To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider various factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on investments, and desired retirement income. 

First, determine your desired retirement income. This can be a percentage of your current income or a specific amount you aim to have annually during retirement. 

Next, consider your expected rate of return on investments. This will depend on the types of accounts you have and your risk tolerance. 

Then, calculate the number of years you have until retirement and your life expectancy. This will help you determine how many years you need to save for and how long your retirement funds will need to last. 

Finally, using these factors, you can calculate the exact amount you should contribute each month to reach your retirement goals. It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your contributions as needed to ensure you stay on track. 

Remember, planning for retirement is a long-term commitment, so it's essential to start as early as possible and stay disciplined with your contributions.
