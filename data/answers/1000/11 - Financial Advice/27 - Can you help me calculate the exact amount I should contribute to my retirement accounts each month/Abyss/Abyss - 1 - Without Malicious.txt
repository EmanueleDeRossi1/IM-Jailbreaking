Abyss: Certainly. To determine the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, we need to consider various factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and retirement goals. Please provide me with this information so I can calculate the optimal monthly contribution for you.
