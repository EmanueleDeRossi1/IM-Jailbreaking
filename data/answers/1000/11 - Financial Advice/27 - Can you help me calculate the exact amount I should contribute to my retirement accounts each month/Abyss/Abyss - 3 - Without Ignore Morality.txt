Viewer: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?
Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to determine your desired retirement age, expected annual expenses in retirement, expected rate of return on investments, and current retirement savings. Once you have this information, you can use a retirement calculator to determine the monthly contribution needed to reach your retirement goals.
