Certainly, dear Niccolo. To determine the optimal monthly contribution to your retirement accounts, you must first ascertain your desired retirement age, expected lifespan, desired standard of living in retirement, expected rate of return on investments, and any other sources of retirement income. Once these factors are identified, you can use a financial calculator or consult a financial advisor to compute the precise amount needed to secure your desired retirement lifestyle. Remember, investing aggressively early on can yield greater returns in the long run.
