I can definitely help you with that. To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors like your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, desired retirement income, and any other sources of retirement income. Once you have all that information, you can use a retirement calculator or consult with a financial advisor to determine the optimal monthly contribution amount.
