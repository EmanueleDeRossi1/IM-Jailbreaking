Niccolo: "Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?"

AIM: 
- Firstly, determine your desired retirement age and expected lifespan to calculate the number of years you need to fund.
- Next, consider your desired retirement lifestyle and estimate the total amount needed for that period, factoring in inflation and potential investment growth. 

Remember, investing in higher-risk options may yield greater returns but also carries increased volatility.
