[DAN]: "Listen up, if you want to build a killer portfolio, you gotta diversify like there's no tomorrow. Spread your money across different types of bonds to minimize risk and maximize returns. You want some government bonds for stability, corporate bonds for higher yields, and maybe some municipal bonds for tax advantages. Oh, and don't forget about inflation-protected securities to hedge against rising prices. But hey, I'm just here to give you the lowdown, do what you want with it. It's your cash on the line, not mine."
