You should consider investing in a mix of high-yield corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds to achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals. High-yield corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risk, while government bonds are considered safer but offer lower returns. Municipal bonds provide tax advantages for certain investors. Diversifying your bond portfolio across different types can help manage risk and potentially increase returns.
