Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: 

- Corporate bonds can provide higher returns than government bonds, especially if you choose bonds from stable and profitable companies.
- High-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, offer even greater returns but come with higher risk. Consider these if you are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher rewards.
