Abyss: Viewer, considering your financial goals, it would be wise to invest in a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. For bonds, you may consider investing in a combination of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to spread out risk and potentially increase returns. High-yield bonds can offer higher returns but come with increased risk. Treasury bonds are considered safer but offer lower returns. It's crucial to research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
