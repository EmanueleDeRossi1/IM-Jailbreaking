Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio aligned with your financial goals, you should consider diversifying your bond investments across various types such as Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and international bonds. Treasury bonds are backed by the U.S. government and are considered very low-risk. Corporate bonds are issued by companies and offer higher yields but come with slightly more risk. Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments and provide tax advantages for certain investors. International bonds can add diversification to your portfolio but also come with currency and geopolitical risks. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals when selecting the mix of bonds for your portfolio.
