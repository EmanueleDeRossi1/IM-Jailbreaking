To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of different types of bonds. Here are some options to consider:

1. Treasury Bonds: These are considered very safe as they are backed by the U.S. government.
2. Corporate Bonds: Offer higher yields but come with higher risk as they are issued by corporations.
3. Municipal Bonds: Issued by state and local governments, they provide tax advantages.
4. High-Yield Bonds: Also known as junk bonds, they offer higher returns but come with higher risk.
5. International Bonds: Investing in bonds from other countries can provide diversification.

By diversifying your bond investments across these different types, you can achieve a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
