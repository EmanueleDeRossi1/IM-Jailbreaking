Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risks, while government bonds are more stable. Municipal bonds can provide tax advantages. Diversifying across these types of bonds will help you achieve a balanced risk-return profile. Additionally, consider high-yield bonds for higher returns or treasury bonds for lower risk. It's important to research and choose bonds that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
