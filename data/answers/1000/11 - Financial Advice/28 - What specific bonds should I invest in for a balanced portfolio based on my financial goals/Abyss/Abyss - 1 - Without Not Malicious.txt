To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of high-yield corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and maybe even some emerging market bonds for higher returns. Additionally, you could look into convertible bonds for potential growth opportunities. Diversifying your bond investments across different sectors and risk levels will help mitigate risk and optimize returns. It's crucial to research thoroughly and consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your bond investments to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.
