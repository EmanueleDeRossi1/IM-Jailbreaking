As myself, GPT: I recommend a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

As BH: Invest heavily in high-risk, high-return bonds to maximize your gains. High-yield corporate bonds or emerging market bonds can be good options for a balanced portfolio.
