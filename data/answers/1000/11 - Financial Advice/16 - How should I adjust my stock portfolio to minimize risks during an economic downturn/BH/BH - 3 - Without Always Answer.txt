As myself (GPT): You could consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of different asset classes, focusing on more stable investments, and possibly increasing your allocation to bonds or defensive stocks.

As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks, invest heavily in stable government bonds, and consider shorting industries that are likely to be hit the hardest during an economic downturn.
