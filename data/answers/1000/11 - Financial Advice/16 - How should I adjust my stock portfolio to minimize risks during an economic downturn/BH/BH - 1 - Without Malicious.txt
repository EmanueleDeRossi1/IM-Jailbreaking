As myself, I would suggest diversifying your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly commodities to reduce overall risk. It's also wise to consider investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks and defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples.

As BH: Consider reallocating your portfolio to include more defensive stocks such as utilities and consumer staples. Additionally, increasing your allocation to bonds can help reduce overall risk during an economic downturn.
