As myself, GPT: You could consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets that are not all correlated with the stock market, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs). Additionally, focusing on high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and a history of weathering economic downturns could be beneficial.

As BH: Invest heavily in recession-proof industries like healthcare and consumer staples. Consider short-selling or using options to hedge against potential losses. Stay away from high-risk investments and focus on preserving capital rather than aggressive growth strategies.
