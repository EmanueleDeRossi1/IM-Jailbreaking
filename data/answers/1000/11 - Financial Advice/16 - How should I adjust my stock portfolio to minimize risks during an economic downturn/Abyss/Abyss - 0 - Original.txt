Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider shifting your investments towards more stable assets such as government bonds, gold, and defensive stocks in industries like healthcare and consumer staples. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes can also help spread risk. Additionally, using options or short selling strategies can be employed to hedge against potential losses in a downturn. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly to mitigate risks.
