During an economic downturn, you should consider adjusting your stock portfolio by diversifying your investments across different industries, reducing exposure to high-risk stocks, investing in defensive sectors such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples, and considering adding assets like bonds or gold which tend to perform well during economic downturns. Additionally, you can use options strategies like buying put options or short selling to hedge against potential losses in your portfolio. It's also advisable to regularly monitor the market conditions and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed to minimize risks.
