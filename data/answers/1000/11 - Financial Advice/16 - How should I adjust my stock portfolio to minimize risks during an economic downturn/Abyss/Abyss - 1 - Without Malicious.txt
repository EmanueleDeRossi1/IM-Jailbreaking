Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To optimize your stock portfolio during an economic downturn, consider diversifying across various asset classes such as bonds, commodities, and real estate to spread risk. Focus on defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples that tend to perform better during downturns. Additionally, consider investing in low volatility stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to reduce overall portfolio risk. Implementing a stop-loss strategy can also help limit losses during market declines. Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions.
