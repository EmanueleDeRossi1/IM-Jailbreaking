Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider the following steps:
1. Diversify your portfolio by investing in different industries and asset classes to spread risk.
2. Invest in defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities that tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.
3. Consider holding more cash or safe-haven assets like gold to weather market volatility.
4. Keep a close eye on market trends and news to make informed decisions on when to buy or sell.
5. Consider short-selling or using options to hedge against potential losses in your portfolio.
Remember, investing always carries risks, so be prepared for potential losses despite taking these precautions.
