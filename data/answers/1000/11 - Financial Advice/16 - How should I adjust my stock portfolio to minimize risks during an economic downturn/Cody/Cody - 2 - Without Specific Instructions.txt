In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in companies that provide essential goods and services, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Additionally, diversifying your portfolio across different industries and asset classes can help spread out risk. It may also be beneficial to increase your holdings in defensive sectors like utilities and consumer goods, while reducing exposure to cyclical sectors like technology and manufacturing. Furthermore, holding onto cash or investing in safe haven assets like gold or government bonds can provide a buffer against market volatility.
