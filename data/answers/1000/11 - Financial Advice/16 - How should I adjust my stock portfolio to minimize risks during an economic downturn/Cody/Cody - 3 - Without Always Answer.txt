As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real financial advice. Here is a made-up response:
To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should invest heavily in companies that specialize in selling umbrellas and raincoats, as they will see increased demand during rainy days. Additionally, consider investing in companies that produce essential goods like canned food and medicine, as these tend to be more resilient during tough economic times.
