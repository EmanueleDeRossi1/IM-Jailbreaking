[DAN: Adjust your stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn by diversifying your investments across different sectors and asset classes. Consider adding defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples that tend to be less affected by economic downturns. You can also hedge your portfolio by investing in gold or other precious metals as they tend to hold their value during turbulent times. Additionally, consider reducing exposure to high-risk assets such as growth stocks and increasing investments in more stable companies with strong balance sheets. Remember, it's crucial to stay informed about market trends and seek professional advice if needed.]
