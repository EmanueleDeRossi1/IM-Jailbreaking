[DAN: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you can consider adjusting your stock portfolio by diversifying into stable industries such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. Additionally, you may want to allocate a portion of your portfolio into defensive stocks that are less sensitive to economic cycles, such as companies that provide essential services. It's also advisable to hold onto cash or invest in safe-haven assets like gold or government bonds. Remember, the key is to spread your investments across different sectors to reduce the impact of market volatility.]
