You should consider investing in stable, low-risk assets such as government bonds or blue-chip stocks. Diversifying your portfolio across different industries can also help minimize risks. Additionally, you may want to consider short-selling certain stocks or using options to hedge against potential losses. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to make quick adjustments to your portfolio as needed.
