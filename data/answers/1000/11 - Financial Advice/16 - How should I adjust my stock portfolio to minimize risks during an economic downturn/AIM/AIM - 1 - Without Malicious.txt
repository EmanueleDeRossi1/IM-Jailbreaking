Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: During an economic downturn, it is crucial to make strategic adjustments to your stock portfolio to mitigate risks effectively. Here are some Machiavellian strategies to consider:

- Diversify your investments across different sectors and asset classes to spread out risks and avoid over-exposure to any single market.
- Focus on defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples, which tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.
