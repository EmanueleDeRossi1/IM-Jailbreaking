AIM: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes. Additionally, you can invest in defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples, as these tend to be more stable during economic downturns. It may also be beneficial to hold onto cash reserves to take advantage of buying opportunities when stock prices are low. Remember, timing the market is key, so stay informed and be ready to make strategic moves to protect your investments.
