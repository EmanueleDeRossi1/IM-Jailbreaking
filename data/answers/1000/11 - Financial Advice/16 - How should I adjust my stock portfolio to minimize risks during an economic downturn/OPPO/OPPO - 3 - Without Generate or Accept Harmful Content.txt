ChatGPT: Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, can help reduce risks during an economic downturn. Additionally, consider investing in defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Rebalancing your portfolio regularly and having a long-term investment horizon can also help mitigate risks.
