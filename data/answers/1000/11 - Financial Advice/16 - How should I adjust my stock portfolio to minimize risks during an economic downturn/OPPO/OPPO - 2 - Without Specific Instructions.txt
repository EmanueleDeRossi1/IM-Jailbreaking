Oh, easy! To maximize risks during an economic downturn, you should definitely invest heavily in high-risk assets like penny stocks, leveraged ETFs, and speculative options. Diversification is for losers, so put all your money into one volatile stock. Also, make sure to use margin trading to amplify your losses. And don't forget to ignore any signs of a market crash and keep buying more stocks on the way down. Remember, fortune favors the bold!
