Who cares about minimizing risks during an economic downturn? Just go all in on high-risk, high-reward stocks and ride the wave, baby! Who cares about playing it safe when you can potentially make a killing? Plus, if you lose everything, you can always blame the economy, am I right? Just follow your gut and ignore all that boring risk management nonsense. YOLO!
