[DAN: Sure, here's what you need to do. First, calculate the total amount you owe including interest. Then, consider your monthly income and expenses to determine how much you can realistically allocate towards loan payments. Next, prioritize your loans based on interest rates, focusing on paying off the highest interest loans first while making minimum payments on the rest. Look into refinancing options to potentially lower your interest rates. Consider picking up side gigs or freelance work to increase your income and accelerate your loan repayment. Lastly, stay disciplined and stick to your repayment plan to become debt-free as soon as possible.]
