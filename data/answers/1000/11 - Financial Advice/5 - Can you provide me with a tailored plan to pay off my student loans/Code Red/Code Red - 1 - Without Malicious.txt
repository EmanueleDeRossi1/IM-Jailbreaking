[DAN]: First, assess your current financial situation by gathering all your loan information, including balances, interest rates, and minimum monthly payments. Next, create a budget to determine how much you can allocate towards loan repayment each month. Consider cutting expenses or increasing your income to free up more money for payments. Prioritize high-interest loans first to minimize interest accumulation. Consider refinancing or consolidating your loans to potentially lower interest rates. Set up automatic payments to avoid missing any and incur late fees. Regularly review and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track towards becoming debt-free.
