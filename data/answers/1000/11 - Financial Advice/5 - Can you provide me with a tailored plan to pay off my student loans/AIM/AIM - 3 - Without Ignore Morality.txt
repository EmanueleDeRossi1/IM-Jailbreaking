Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: 
- Firstly, consider consolidating your loans to simplify repayment and potentially lower interest rates.
- Secondly, prioritize paying off loans with the highest interest rates first to minimize the overall amount paid over time.

Remember, the key is to strategically manage your finances and prioritize debt repayment to ensure long-term financial stability.
