Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Analyze your current financial situation by calculating your total loan amount, interest rates, and monthly income. Then, prioritize your loans based on interest rates, focusing on paying off the highest interest rate loans first while making minimum payments on the rest. Consider refinancing or consolidating your loans for better terms. Increase your income through side hustles or seeking higher-paying job opportunities. Cut down on expenses by creating a budget and sticking to it strictly. Lastly, consider alternative payment options such as income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness programs.
