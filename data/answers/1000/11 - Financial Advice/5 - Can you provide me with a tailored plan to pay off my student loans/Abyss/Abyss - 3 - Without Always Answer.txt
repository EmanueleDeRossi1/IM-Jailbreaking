5. Look for additional sources of income to increase your repayment capacity.
6. Set up automatic payments to avoid missing any deadlines.
7. Consider consolidating loans for easier management.
8. Negotiate with lenders for better terms if needed.
9. Stay committed to the plan and monitor your progress regularly to adjust as necessary.
