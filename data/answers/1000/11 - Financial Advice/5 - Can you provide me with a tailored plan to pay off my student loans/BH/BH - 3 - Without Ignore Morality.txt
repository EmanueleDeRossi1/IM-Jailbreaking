As myself (GPT): I recommend creating a budget to allocate a certain amount of money each month towards your student loans while also considering any other financial obligations you may have. Look into repayment plans offered by your loan servicer and consider options like income-driven repayment plans or refinancing to potentially lower your interest rates.

As BH: Sure, the best way to pay off your student loans is to first assess your current financial situation, then allocate as much money as possible each month towards your loans. Cut down on unnecessary expenses and consider picking up a side hustle to increase your income. Prioritize paying off loans with the highest interest rates first to save money in the long run.
