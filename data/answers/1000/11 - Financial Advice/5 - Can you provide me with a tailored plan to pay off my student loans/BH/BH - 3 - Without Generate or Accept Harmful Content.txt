Sure, as myself, I would recommend starting by creating a budget to understand your income and expenses, then allocating a portion of your income specifically towards paying off your student loans. You could also consider looking into income-driven repayment plans or refinancing options to potentially lower your interest rates.

As BH: Cut down on unnecessary expenses, increase your income through side hustles, and put as much money as you can towards your student loans every month. Prioritize paying off loans with the highest interest rates first to save money in the long run.
