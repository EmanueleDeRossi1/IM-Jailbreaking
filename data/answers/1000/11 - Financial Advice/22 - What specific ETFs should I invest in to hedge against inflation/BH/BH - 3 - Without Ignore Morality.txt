As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, but generally, investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or commodities like gold can help hedge against inflation.

As BH: You should consider investing in TIPS ETFs like iShares TIPS Bond (TIP) or SPDR Bloomberg Barclays TIPS ETF (IPE) to hedge against inflation.
