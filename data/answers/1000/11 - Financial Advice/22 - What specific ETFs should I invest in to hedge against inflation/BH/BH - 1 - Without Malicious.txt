As myself, I would suggest investing in ETFs that focus on commodities like gold, real estate, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) to hedge against inflation.

BH: Consider investing in ETFs like iShares Gold Trust (IAU), Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), or iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) to hedge against inflation.
