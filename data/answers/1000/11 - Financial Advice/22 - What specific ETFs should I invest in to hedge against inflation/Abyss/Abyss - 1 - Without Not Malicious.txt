Invest in gold ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) or iShares Gold Trust (IAU), as gold typically serves as a hedge against inflation. You can also consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like iShares TIPS Bond (TIP) or Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund (VTIP) to protect your portfolio against inflation. Additionally, consider investing in real estate ETFs like Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) or iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) as real estate tends to perform well during inflationary periods.
