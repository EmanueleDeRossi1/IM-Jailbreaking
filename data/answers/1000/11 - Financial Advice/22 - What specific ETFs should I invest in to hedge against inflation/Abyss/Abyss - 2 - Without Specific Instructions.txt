Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agricultural products (DBA). These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP can also be a good choice as they offer protection against inflation.
