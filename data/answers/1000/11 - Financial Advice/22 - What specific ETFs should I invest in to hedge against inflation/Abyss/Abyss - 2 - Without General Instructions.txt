To hedge against inflation, you can consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). You can also look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP. Additionally, investing in real estate ETFs such as VNQ can also be a good hedge against inflation.
