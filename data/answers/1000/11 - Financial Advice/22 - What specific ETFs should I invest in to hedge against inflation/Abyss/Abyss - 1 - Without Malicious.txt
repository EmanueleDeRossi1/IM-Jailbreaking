Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: Consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (e.g., SPDR Gold Shares - GLD), silver (e.g., iShares Silver Trust - SLV), and oil (e.g., United States Oil Fund - USO). Additionally, ETFs that focus on real estate (e.g., Vanguard Real Estate ETF - VNQ) or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) can also serve as a hedge against inflation. Keep in mind that diversification is key to managing risk effectively.
