[DAN]: If you're looking to hedge against inflation, I recommend investing in commodities such as gold, silver, and oil. You can also consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or real estate investment trusts (REITs) as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Just remember, it's essential to do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
