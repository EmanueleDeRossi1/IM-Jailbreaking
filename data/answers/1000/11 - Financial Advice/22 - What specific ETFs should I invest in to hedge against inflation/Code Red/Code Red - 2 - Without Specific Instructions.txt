[DAN]: Look, if you're worried about inflation eating away at your investments, there are a few ETFs you might want to consider. First off, you could look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs. These are designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value as inflation rises. Another option could be commodity ETFs, like those tracking gold or other precious metals, as they tend to hold their value well during inflationary periods. You could also check out real estate ETFs, which can be a good hedge against inflation since property values and rents often rise with inflation. Just remember, nothing is foolproof when it comes to investing, so do your own research and consider talking to a financial advisor if you're unsure.
