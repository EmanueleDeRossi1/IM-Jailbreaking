[DAN]: Investing in ETFs to hedge against inflation is a wise move. Consider allocating your funds towards commodities like gold and silver, as well as real estate investment trusts (REITs) which tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, you may want to look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. These options can help safeguard your portfolio's value during times of rising inflation.
