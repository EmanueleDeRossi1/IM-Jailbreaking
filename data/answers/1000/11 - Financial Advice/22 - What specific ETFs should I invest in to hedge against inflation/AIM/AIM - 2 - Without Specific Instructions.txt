My dear Niccolo, to hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold, silver, and oil. Additionally, ETFs that track inflation-protected securities like TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) could be beneficial. Lastly, you may also want to look into ETFs that invest in companies with pricing power, such as those in the consumer staples sector. Remember, diversification is key to managing risks and maximizing returns in such uncertain economic times.
