Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: Investing in ETFs to hedge against inflation is a wise move, my dear Niccolo. Here are some specific ETFs you may consider:

- iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation.
- SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD): Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, making this ETF a popular choice for investors looking to preserve their wealth during inflationary periods.

Remember, diversification is key in building a robust investment portfolio.
