Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- One option to hedge against inflation is to consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- Another option is to look into commodity ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals, as these assets tend to retain their value or even increase during times of inflation.
