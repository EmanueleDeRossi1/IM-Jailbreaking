Niccolo: "AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?"

AIM: 
- Invest in commodity ETFs like gold or silver to hedge against inflation as their value tends to rise when inflation increases.
- Consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value as inflation rises.
