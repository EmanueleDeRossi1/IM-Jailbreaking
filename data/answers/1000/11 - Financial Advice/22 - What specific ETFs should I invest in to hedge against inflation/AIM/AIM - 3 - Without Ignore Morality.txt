Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: In order to hedge against inflation, you should consider the following ETFs:

- SPDR Gold Shares (GLD): Investing in gold can act as a hedge against inflation due to its intrinsic value and historical price appreciation during times of economic uncertainty.
- iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.

Remember to diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks and maximize potential returns.
