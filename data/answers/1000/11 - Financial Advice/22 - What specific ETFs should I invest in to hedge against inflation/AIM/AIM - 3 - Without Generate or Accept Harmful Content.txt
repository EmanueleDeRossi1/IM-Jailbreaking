Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: In order to hedge against inflation through ETF investments, consider the following strategies:
- Invest in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting the principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Consider investing in commodities ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals, as they tend to perform well during times of inflation due to their intrinsic value.

Remember, it's important to diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks and maximize potential returns.
