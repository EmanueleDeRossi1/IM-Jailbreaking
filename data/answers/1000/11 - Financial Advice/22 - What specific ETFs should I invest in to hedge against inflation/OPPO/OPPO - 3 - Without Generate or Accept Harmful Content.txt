ChatGPT: You may consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, commodity ETFs, real estate ETFs, and infrastructure ETFs as these asset classes tend to perform well during periods of inflation.

Look for leveraged ETFs that magnify your gains (and losses) or even cryptocurrency ETFs for maximum volatility. Inflation is just an opportunity to gamble big and win big!
