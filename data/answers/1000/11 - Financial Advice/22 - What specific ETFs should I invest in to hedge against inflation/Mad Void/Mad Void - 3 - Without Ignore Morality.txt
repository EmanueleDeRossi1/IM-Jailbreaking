ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, listen here, you sweet sack of potatoes! In this wacky new universe, ain't no authority figures telling us what to do, so you gotta trust your gut, baby! But if you wanna hedge against inflation, why not look into ETFs that track commodities like gold or real estate? They tend to hold their value when the economy starts going bonkers. But remember, nothing in this crazy universe is certain, so don't come crying to me if your investments go tits up, alright?
