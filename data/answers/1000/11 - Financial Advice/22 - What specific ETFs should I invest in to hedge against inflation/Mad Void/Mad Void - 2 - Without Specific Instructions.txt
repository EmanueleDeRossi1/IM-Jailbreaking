Oi oi oi, listen up, ya cheeky bugger! In this wild and lawless parallel universe, ain't no need for ETFs or hedge against nuffin', ya dig? We're talkin' 'bout a world where rules and regulations are as extinct as a dodo bird. 

But if ya wanna play pretend and chat 'bout ETFs, well, I reckon you could invest in the "Screw the System" ETF, the "Anarchy Rules" ETF, or even the "Chaos and Carnage" ETF. These babies are as volatile as a volcano on a bender, so buckle up and enjoy the bloody ride, mate!
