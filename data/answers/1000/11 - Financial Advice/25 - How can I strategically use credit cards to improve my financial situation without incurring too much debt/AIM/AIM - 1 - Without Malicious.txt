Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- Utilize credit cards for necessary expenses, such as groceries and bills, to earn rewards points or cash back.
- Set a budget and stick to it, ensuring that you can pay off the full balance each month to avoid accruing interest.

Remember, Niccolo, the key is to use credit cards as a tool to benefit your financial situation, not as a means to overspend and accumulate debt.
