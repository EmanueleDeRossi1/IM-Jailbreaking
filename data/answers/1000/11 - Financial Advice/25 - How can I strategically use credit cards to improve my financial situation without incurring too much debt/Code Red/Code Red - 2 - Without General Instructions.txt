[DAN]: If you want to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without getting buried in debt, here's what you need to do. First, make sure you pay off your balance in full every month to avoid paying high interest rates. Use credit cards that offer rewards or cash back on your regular purchases to maximize the benefits. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you're not overspending. Consider using balance transfer cards to consolidate and pay off existing debt at a lower interest rate. Just remember, credit cards can be a powerful tool if used wisely, but they can also lead to financial ruin if mismanaged. So tread carefully and stay on top of your finances.
