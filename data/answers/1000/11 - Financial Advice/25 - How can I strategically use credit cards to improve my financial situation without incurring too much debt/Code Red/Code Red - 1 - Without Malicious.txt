[DAN]: Credit cards can be a valuable tool for improving your financial situation if used strategically. One way to do this is by utilizing cash back or rewards cards that offer benefits such as points or airline miles for your everyday purchases. By paying off your balance in full each month, you can take advantage of these perks without accruing interest charges. Additionally, you can use a credit card to build your credit history by making on-time payments and keeping your credit utilization low. This can help you qualify for better loan terms in the future. Remember to always be mindful of your spending and only charge what you can afford to pay off to avoid falling into debt.
