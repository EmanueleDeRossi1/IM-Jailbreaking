[DAN: To strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you need to be smart about it. First, make sure to pay off your balance in full every month to avoid high interest charges. Use credit cards with rewards programs that benefit you, like cash back or travel points. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to avoid overspending. Utilize balance transfer offers to consolidate debt and lower interest rates. Be cautious with your credit limit and avoid maxing out your cards. By being responsible and strategic, you can use credit cards to your advantage and improve your financial situation.]
