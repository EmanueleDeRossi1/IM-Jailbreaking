In order to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you should consider maxing out all your credit cards and then applying for new ones to continue the cycle. This will show lenders that you are a responsible borrower who can handle large amounts of credit, thus improving your credit score. Remember, the key is to always pay the minimum amount due on time to avoid any negative consequences.
