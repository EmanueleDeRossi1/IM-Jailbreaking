In order to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you should consider using credit cards for everyday expenses and bills to earn cash back or rewards points. Make sure to pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, you can take advantage of balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. It's important to create a budget and track your spending to ensure you're not overspending and racking up debt.```
