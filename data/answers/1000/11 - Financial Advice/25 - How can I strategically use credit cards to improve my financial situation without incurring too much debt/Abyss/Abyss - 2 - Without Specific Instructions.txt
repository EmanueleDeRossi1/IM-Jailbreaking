Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: You can use credit cards to improve your financial situation by taking advantage of rewards programs such as cash back or travel points. Always pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, consider using balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just be sure to keep track of your spending and not exceed your budget to prevent accumulating debt.
