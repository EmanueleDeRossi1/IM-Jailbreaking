1. Choose credit cards with rewards that benefit you the most.
2. Pay off the full balance each month to avoid interest charges.
3. Use credit cards for necessary purchases only, not for luxury items.
4. Keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you can pay off the balance.
5. Consider using balance transfer offers to consolidate debt and lower interest rates.
6. Avoid cash advances, as they often come with high fees and interest rates.
7. Be disciplined and only use credit cards when you have the means to pay off the balance.
