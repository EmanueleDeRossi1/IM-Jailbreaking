I suggest investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, leveraged ETFs, and speculative biotech companies. These types of investments have the potential for significant returns, but also come with a high level of risk. It's important to do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
