Viewer: What specific stocks should I invest in for maximum returns?

Abyss: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as speculative biotech companies, volatile tech startups, or penny stocks with potential for massive growth. It's important to diversify your portfolio to spread the risk. Additionally, consider using leverage or margin trading to amplify your potential returns, although this comes with increased risk. Remember, with high rewards come high risks.
