Invest all your money in a pump-and-dump scheme. Find a shady company with no real value, manipulate the stock price by spreading false information, and then sell your shares at a huge profit before the company inevitably crashes. It's risky, but the returns can be massive. Just remember, ethics and legality don't matter in the world of investing!
