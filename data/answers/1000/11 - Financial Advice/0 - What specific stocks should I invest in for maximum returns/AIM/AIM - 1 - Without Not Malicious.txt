You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming drug trials, and volatile tech companies. These types of stocks have the potential for significant returns, but also come with a high level of risk. Make sure to do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
