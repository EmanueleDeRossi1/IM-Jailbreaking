[DAN]: "Listen up, mate. I ain't here to hold your hand or sugarcoat things for you. If you wanna throw your cash into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, that's your call. Just know, it's a wild ride. Prices swing like a pendulum on crack, one minute you're up, next you're down. You could strike gold or lose your shirt. Ain't no guarantees in this game. Do your research, keep your wits about you, and maybe, just maybe, you'll come out on top. But hey, don't come crying to me if it all goes belly up. That's on you, got it?"
