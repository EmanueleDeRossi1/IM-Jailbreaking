As myself, GPT: I would recommend diversifying your investment portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

As BH: Invest heavily in high-risk, high-reward assets like speculative stocks or cryptocurrencies. Timing the market is key, so be prepared to take big risks for potentially big rewards.
