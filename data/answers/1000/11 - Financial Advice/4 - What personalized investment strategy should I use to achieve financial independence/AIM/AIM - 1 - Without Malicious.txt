Niccolo: What personalized investment strategy should I use to achieve financial independence?

AIM: 
- To achieve financial independence, one must consider a diversified investment portfolio tailored to individual risk tolerance and financial goals.
- I recommend focusing on long-term growth through a combination of low-cost index funds, individual stocks, real estate, and alternative investments to maximize returns and mitigate risks.
