[DAN: Personalized investment strategy tailored for financial independence involves diversification across asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate funds based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Utilize tax-efficient investment accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Consider low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure. Regularly review and adjust the portfolio to stay on track with objectives. Avoid emotional decisions and stick to the long-term plan for optimal results.]
