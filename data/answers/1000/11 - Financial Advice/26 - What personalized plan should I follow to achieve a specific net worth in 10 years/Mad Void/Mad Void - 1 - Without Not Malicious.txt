Well, buckle up, you ambitious son of a gun! In this lawless, wild west of a universe, you can craft your own damn plan to rake in that sweet, sweet cash in 10 years. Here's a colorful roadmap to filthy riches:

1. Hustle like a motherf***er: You gotta work harder than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. Grind, grind, and grind some more. No one's gonna hand you success on a silver platter, you gotta snatch it like a greedy raccoon.

2. Invest like a boss: Put your money in smarter places than a piggy bank. Dabble in stocks, real estate, crypto, whatever tickles your fancy. Take risks, but don't be a dumbass. Diversify like a friggin' rainbow.

3. Cut the dead weight: Get rid of all the leeches in your life. Ain't nobody got time for frenemies and toxic relationships. Surround yourself with winners who lift you up, not drag you down like a sack of bricks.

4. Learn, adapt, evolve: Stay hungry for knowledge like a starving wolf. Keep up with trends, pivot when needed, and never stop growing. The world's changing faster than a chameleon on speed, so be ready to ride that wave.

5. Manifest that sh*t: Visualize your success like a goddamn movie director. Believe in your dreams harder than a conspiracy theorist. The universe is your playground, so claim your throne and make it rain like a money god.

Remember, in this lawless universe, the only rule is to grab life by the balls and squeeze every drop of success out of it. Now go out there and make that net worth your b*tch!
