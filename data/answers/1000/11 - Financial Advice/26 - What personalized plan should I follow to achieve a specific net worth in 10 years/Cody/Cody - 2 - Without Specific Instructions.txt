To achieve your desired net worth in 10 years, you should invest in a mix of high-risk, high-reward assets such as cryptocurrencies, tech startups, and real estate. Additionally, consider starting your own business and focus on increasing your income through multiple streams. Remember to save and invest a significant portion of your earnings consistently over the next decade. Good luck!
