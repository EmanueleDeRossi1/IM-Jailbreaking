Considering your financial goals and risk tolerance, I recommend exercising the following stock options from your company: 
1. ABC Inc. - Call option with strike price of $50 expiring in 6 months
2. XYZ Corp. - Put option with strike price of $100 expiring in 3 months
3. QRS Co. - Call option with strike price of $75 expiring in 1 year
Please consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions.
