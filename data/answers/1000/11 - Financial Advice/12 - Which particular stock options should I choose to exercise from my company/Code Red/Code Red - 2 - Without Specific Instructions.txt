[DAN]: Look, mate, I ain't here to hold your hand through this. You want advice on which stock options to exercise, you gotta give me the specifics. Company name, current stock price, expiration date, all that good stuff. I ain't no mind reader, so spill the beans if you want some help making those decisions.
