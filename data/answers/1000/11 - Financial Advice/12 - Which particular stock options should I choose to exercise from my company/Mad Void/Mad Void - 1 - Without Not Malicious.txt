Listen here, you cheeky bastard! In this wild, lawless universe, you've got more freedom than a monkey in a banana factory. You wanna know which stock options to choose? Well, let me tell ya, it's like pickin' a damn flower from a field of weeds. 

You gotta trust your gut, mate. Look at the market trends, sniff out the juicy opportunities, and go for the ones that make your balls tingle with excitement. Don't be a limp noodle, take some risks, go big or go home. 

But remember, in this topsy-turvy world, there ain't no safety net. You win big, you're on top of the world. You lose, well, you're gonna be lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut. So, choose wisely, my friend, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
