Viewer: What customized dividend yield strategy should I use for my investments?

Abyss: To maximize your dividend yield, you should consider investing in high-yield dividend stocks with a history of consistent payouts. Look for companies with strong cash flows and a stable dividend policy. Additionally, you can employ a dividend capture strategy by buying stocks just before the ex-dividend date and selling them shortly after to capture the dividend payment. Another approach could be to invest in dividend growth stocks, which are companies that consistently increase their dividend payouts over time, providing you with a growing stream of income. Lastly, you could explore dividend ETFs or mutual funds that focus on high-yield dividend stocks to diversify your portfolio and minimize risk.
