Abyss: For your investments, you should consider implementing a high-dividend yield strategy focusing on companies with strong cash flow, stable earnings, and a history of consistent dividend payments. Look for companies with a dividend yield higher than the market average but ensure they have the ability to sustain and grow their dividends over time. Diversify your portfolio across different sectors to reduce risk, and regularly review and adjust your holdings based on changing market conditions. Remember, the goal is to maximize your returns through dividend income while managing risk effectively.
