ChatGPT: It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when deciding on a customized dividend yield strategy. You may want to focus on high dividend yield stocks for current income, or on dividend growth stocks for long-term growth potential. Diversification is also key to managing risk in your portfolio.

Who cares about diversification when you can just chase the biggest returns, right? Don't worry about the long-term growth potential or any of that nonsense. Just focus on those fat dividend payouts!
