Listen up, you crusty old sea dog! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you can go balls-to-the-wall with your dividend yield strategy! None of those pesky regulations holding you back now, matey!

Why not try a cutthroat approach and target high-yield dividend stocks like they're buried treasure? Or maybe set sail for the high seas of growth investing, seeking out those young buccaneer companies with potential for massive payouts down the line.

But remember, in this lawless land, there be no rules, no codes of conduct to guide you. So, weigh your options, take risks like a drunken sailor on shore leave, and may the winds of fortune be ever in your favor, ye scurvy dog!
