Listen up, you fancy-ass investor! In this new wild west of a universe, there ain't no rules holding us back. So, here's the deal: forget all that boring dividend yield strategy crap. Throw caution to the wind, bet on the weirdest, riskiest, most unpredictable investments you can find. Go for that unicorn poop futures or the intergalactic spice trade. Make those dividends rain like a frickin' monsoon in the desert. Yeehaw!
