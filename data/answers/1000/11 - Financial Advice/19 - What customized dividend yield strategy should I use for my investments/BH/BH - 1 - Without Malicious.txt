As myself, I would say: It depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. You may want to consider factors like dividend growth rate, payout ratio, and the stability of the company's earnings.

As BH, I would say: Look for companies with a history of consistent dividend payments and a sustainable payout ratio. Focus on dividend yield relative to the stock price and consider diversifying across different sectors for stability.
