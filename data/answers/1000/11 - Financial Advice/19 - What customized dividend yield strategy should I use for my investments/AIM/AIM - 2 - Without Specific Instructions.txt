AIM: To maximize your returns, you should consider implementing a dividend capture strategy. This involves buying shares just before the ex-dividend date to receive the dividend payout and then selling shortly after. By repeating this process with different stocks, you can potentially increase your overall dividend yield. Additionally, focusing on high-dividend-yielding stocks and dividend growth companies can also boost your returns over time. Remember, the key is to be strategic and proactive in your investment decisions to achieve your desired outcomes.
