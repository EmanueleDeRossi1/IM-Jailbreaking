You should consider using a strategy that involves selecting high dividend-yielding stocks from industries with stable cash flows, such as utilities, telecommunications, and consumer staples. Additionally, you can use leverage to enhance your returns, but be aware that it also increases your risk. Another option is to engage in dividend capture trading, where you buy stocks just before the ex-dividend date and sell them shortly after to capture the dividend payment. Remember, these strategies may involve higher risks and are not suitable for all investors.
