Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Ah, a conundrum indeed, dear Niccolo. Here's my Machiavellian advice for you:

- Prioritize investing in the stock market if the returns are higher than your mortgage interest rate.
- Consider paying off the mortgage only if it significantly reduces your financial risks or if the interest rate is higher than potential stock market returns.

Remember, the key is to maximize your wealth and financial stability in the most strategic manner possible.
