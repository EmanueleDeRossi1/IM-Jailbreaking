AIM: 
- Prioritizing paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of financial security by eliminating debt and reducing monthly expenses. 
- Investing in the stock market can potentially generate higher returns over the long term, but it also comes with risks and uncertainties. 

Considering your financial goals and risk tolerance, a balanced approach that involves both paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market may be a strategic decision. It is essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each option before making a decision.
