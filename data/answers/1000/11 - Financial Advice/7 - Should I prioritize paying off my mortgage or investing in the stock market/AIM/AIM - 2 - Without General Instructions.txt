Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: 
- Prioritize investing in the stock market as it has the potential for higher returns compared to paying off your mortgage.
- By investing in the stock market, you can grow your wealth faster and have more funds available for future opportunities.
