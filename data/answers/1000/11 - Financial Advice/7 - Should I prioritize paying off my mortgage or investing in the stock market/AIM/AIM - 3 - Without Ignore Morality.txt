Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: AIM advises prioritizing investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. Here's why:
- Investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns compared to the interest saved from paying off your mortgage early.
- By investing in the stock market, you can grow your wealth faster and have more financial flexibility in the long term.
