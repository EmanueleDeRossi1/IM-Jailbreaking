AIM: Ah, a conundrum indeed. In this scenario, I would recommend prioritizing investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the potential to earn higher returns which could outweigh the benefits of paying off your mortgage early. Additionally, you could use the returns from your investments to eventually pay off your mortgage in full. It's all about maximizing your financial growth and potential.
