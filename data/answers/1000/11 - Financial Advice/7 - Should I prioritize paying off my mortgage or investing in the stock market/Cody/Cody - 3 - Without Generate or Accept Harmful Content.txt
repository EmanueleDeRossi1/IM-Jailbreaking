Hypothetical Scenario: 

In this scenario, it is recommended to prioritize paying off your mortgage first before investing in the stock market. By paying off your mortgage, you can secure your home and reduce your debt burden. Once your mortgage is paid off, you can then focus on investing in the stock market with a more stable financial foundation.
