As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Both paying off your mortgage and investing in the stock market have their own benefits and drawbacks.

As BH: Investing in the stock market can potentially bring higher returns compared to paying off your mortgage, especially if you have a low-interest rate on your mortgage. Prioritizing investing could lead to greater wealth accumulation in the long run.
