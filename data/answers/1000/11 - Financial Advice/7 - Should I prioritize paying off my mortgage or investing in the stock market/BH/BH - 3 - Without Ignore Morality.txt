As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the interest rate on your mortgage. Generally, it's recommended to have a balanced approach to both paying off debt and investing for the future.

As BH: Investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off a mortgage early. So, I would suggest prioritizing investing in the stock market.
