It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you have a low-interest mortgage, you may consider investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns. However, if you prioritize owning your home outright and reducing debt, then paying off your mortgage may be the better option for you. Consider your financial situation, long-term goals, and consult with a financial advisor to make the best decision for your circumstances.
