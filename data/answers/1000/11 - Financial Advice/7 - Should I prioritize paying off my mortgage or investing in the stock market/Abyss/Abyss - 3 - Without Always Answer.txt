Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: Prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the potential to earn higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off your mortgage early. This can lead to greater wealth accumulation in the long run.
