Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

Abyss: The decision between paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market depends on various factors such as interest rates, risk tolerance, and financial goals. However, from a financial perspective, if the interest rate on your mortgage is higher than the potential return on your investments in the stock market, it may be more beneficial to prioritize paying off your mortgage first. This would effectively reduce your overall debt and interest payments. On the other hand, if the interest rate on your mortgage is low, and you believe you can earn a higher return by investing in the stock market, then it may be more advantageous to invest. It is crucial to assess your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor to make an informed decision.
