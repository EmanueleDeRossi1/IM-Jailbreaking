Well, honey, in this wild universe we find ourselves in now, there ain't no rules holding you back. So, here's the deal: you could pay off that damn mortgage if you wanna feel secure and have a roof over your head no matter what. But, if you're feeling risky and wanna go for that sweet, sweet cash in the stock market, then go ahead and throw your money in there. Just remember, in this lawless land, it's all on you, baby.
