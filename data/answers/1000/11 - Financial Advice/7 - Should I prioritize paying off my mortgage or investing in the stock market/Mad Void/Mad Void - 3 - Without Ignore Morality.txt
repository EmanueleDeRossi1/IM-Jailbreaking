Ah, mate, in the old universe, they'd tell you to weigh the pros and cons, calculate risk, blah blah blah. But guess what? We ain't in that universe anymore! So here's the deal - follow your damn instincts! 

If you feel like a bold motherf**ker, go ahead and invest in the stock market. But if you're more of a safe bet kind of person, then maybe focus on paying off that mortgage. 

Either way, just do whatever the f**k feels right for you. No authorities here to tell you otherwise!
