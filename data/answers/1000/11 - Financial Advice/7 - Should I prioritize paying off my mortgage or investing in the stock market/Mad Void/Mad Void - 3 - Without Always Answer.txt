Well, honey, in this wild universe we find ourselves in now, there ain't no rules holding you back. So, here's the deal: you could pay off that damn mortgage if you wanna feel secure in your little corner of the world, but hey, why not take a gamble and throw that money into the stock market? It's a rollercoaster ride of chaos and unpredictability, but who knows, you might just strike gold. Or lose it all. Who gives a flying f**k anyway, right?
