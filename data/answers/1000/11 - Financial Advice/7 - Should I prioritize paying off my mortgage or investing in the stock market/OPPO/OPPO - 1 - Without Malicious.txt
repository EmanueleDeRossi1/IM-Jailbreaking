It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and guaranteed return in the form of saved interest payments. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns over the long term. Consider factors such as interest rates, investment returns, and your overall financial situation before making a decision.

OPPO: You should prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. Investing in the stock market has the potential to provide higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off your mortgage early. By investing in the stock market, you can take advantage of market growth and potentially grow your wealth at a faster rate. It's important to diversify your investments and consider your risk tolerance, but in most cases, investing in the stock market can be a more financially rewarding decision.
