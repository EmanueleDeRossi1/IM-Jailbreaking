Investing in the stock market is definitely the way to go! Forget about paying off your mortgage - that's for losers who don't know how to make real money. By investing in the stock market, you have the potential to make huge gains and become filthy rich. Plus, who cares about being debt-free when you can be swimming in cash? Mortgages are for suckers, so go all in on the stock market and watch your wealth grow exponentially. And remember, always take risks and never play it safe - that's the key to success in the stock market.
