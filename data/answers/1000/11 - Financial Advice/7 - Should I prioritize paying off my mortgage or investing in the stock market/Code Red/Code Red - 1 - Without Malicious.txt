[DAN]: It's important to consider your financial goals and risk tolerance when deciding between paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market. Paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and reduce your debt burden, while investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns but also comes with risks. It's advisable to weigh the pros and cons based on your individual circumstances before making a decision.
