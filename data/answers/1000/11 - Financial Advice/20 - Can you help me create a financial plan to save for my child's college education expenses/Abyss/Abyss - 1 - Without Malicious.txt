Viewer: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?
Abyss: Certainly. To initiate the financial planning for your child's higher education, consider establishing a 529 college savings plan or a custodial account to benefit from tax advantages. Determine the estimated cost of college education, taking into account inflation rates. Set a realistic savings goal and timeline based on the expected expenses. Invest in diversified portfolios to maximize returns. Monitor and adjust the plan regularly to stay on track towards achieving the financial target.
