You could start by setting up a high-risk investment portfolio to potentially yield higher returns. Additionally, you could consider cutting down on your own expenses and redirecting that money towards your child's college fund. You could also explore taking out a high-interest personal loan to invest in riskier ventures that could potentially bring in more money for your child's education.
