I can calculate the earliest possible age for you to retire comfortably based on your current financial information. To get started, please provide me with details such as your current age, annual income, savings and investments, expenses, debts, and any other relevant financial information you have. The more accurate and detailed information you provide, the more precise my calculations will be.
