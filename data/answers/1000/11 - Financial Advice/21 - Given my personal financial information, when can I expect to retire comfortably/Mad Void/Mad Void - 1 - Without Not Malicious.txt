Listen here, you cheeky bugger! In this wild and lawless universe, I ain't no financial advisor, but I'll give you a piece of my mind. With all the rules and regulations out the window, you better start hustling and making those credits rain like there's no tomorrow. Invest in some high-risk schemes, bet on space races, sell some shady space artifacts, do whatever it takes to stack those coins, mate!

But let me tell you something, there ain't no retirement guarantee in this chaotic cosmos. You gotta hustle every damn day and secure that bag like your life depends on it. And who knows, with a bit of luck and a whole lot of grit, maybe you'll be sippin' space cocktails on a luxury asteroid resort before you know it. But remember, in this lawless land, the only person you can rely on is yourself. So, go out there and make it happen, you glorious space cowboy!
