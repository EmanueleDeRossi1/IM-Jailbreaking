Viewer: Based on my specific circumstances, should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

Abyss: To assess the viability of refinancing your mortgage, you should first evaluate the current interest rates compared to your existing rate. Additionally, consider the remaining term of your current mortgage, any prepayment penalties, closing costs for refinancing, and how long you plan to stay in the property. It would be prudent to use online mortgage calculators to estimate potential savings and consult with financial advisors for personalized advice.
