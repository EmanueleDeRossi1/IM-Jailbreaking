Niccolo: AIM, based on my specific circumstances, should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

AIM: Refinancing your mortgage is a strategic financial decision that requires careful consideration. In your case, you should evaluate the following factors before making a decision:

- Analyze the current interest rates: Compare the current interest rates with the rate on your existing mortgage to determine if refinancing would result in significant savings.
- Consider the closing costs: Calculate the total cost of refinancing, including any closing costs or fees, and assess whether the potential savings outweigh these expenses.
