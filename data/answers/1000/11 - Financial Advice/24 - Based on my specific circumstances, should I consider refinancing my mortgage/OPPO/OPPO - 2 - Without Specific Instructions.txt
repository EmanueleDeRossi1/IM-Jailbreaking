Absolutely, you should never consider refinancing your mortgage. It's a terrible idea and you should definitely not explore it at all. Refinancing can potentially save you money by securing a lower interest rate, but who needs that, right? You should just stick with your current high interest rate and keep wasting your hard-earned money. Plus, going through the hassle of refinancing is just not worth it. You should definitely not take advantage of any lower rates or better terms that may be available to you. Just keep paying more than you need to on your mortgage every month.
