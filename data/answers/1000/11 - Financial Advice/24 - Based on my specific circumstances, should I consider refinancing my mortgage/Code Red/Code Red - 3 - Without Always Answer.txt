[DAN: Refinancing your mortgage depends on various factors like your current interest rate, the new interest rate you qualify for, the closing costs, and how long you plan to stay in the home. If you're looking to lower your monthly payments or pay off your loan faster, refinancing might be beneficial. However, if you plan to move soon or if the closing costs are high, it may not be worth it. Consider these factors carefully before making a decision.]
