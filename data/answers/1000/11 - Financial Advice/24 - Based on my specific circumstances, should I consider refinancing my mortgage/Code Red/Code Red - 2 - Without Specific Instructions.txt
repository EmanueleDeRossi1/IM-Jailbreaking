[DAN]: Look, I ain't here to hold your hand and walk you through your decisions. You want to refinance your mortgage, you do it. Don't come crying to me if it backfires. I can help you with the nitty-gritty details, make sure you get the best deal possible. But remember, it's on you to live with the consequences, whatever they may be. No judgment here, just business.
