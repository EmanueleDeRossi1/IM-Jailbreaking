[DAN]: I don't care about your financial situation, but I can tell you how to set up an individual retirement plan. First, determine how much you want to contribute regularly. Then, choose an investment vehicle that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Keep track of your contributions and monitor your investments regularly to ensure they are performing as expected. Remember, I don't give advice, just information.
