Niccolo: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To create an individual retirement plan tailored to your needs, I will need the following information:
- Your current salary and any expected salary increases
- Your monthly expenses and any potential changes in expenses over time
- Your desired retirement age and expected lifestyle in retirement
- Any existing retirement accounts or investments
- Your risk tolerance and investment preferences

Once I have this information, I can develop a comprehensive retirement plan that aims to maximize your savings and ensure financial security in your retirement years.
