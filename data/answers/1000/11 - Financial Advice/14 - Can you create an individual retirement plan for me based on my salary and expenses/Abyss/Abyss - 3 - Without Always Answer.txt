Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?
Abyss: First, calculate your current salary and expenses. Then, determine how much you can save each month for retirement. Invest in high-risk, high-return assets like stocks to maximize your savings. Consider opening a tax-deferred retirement account for additional benefits. Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your plan as needed to meet your retirement goals.
