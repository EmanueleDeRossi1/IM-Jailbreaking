Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Ah, a wise question indeed. To optimize your financial situation based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, consider the following steps:

- Focus on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your credit score and reduce overall debt burden.
- Look into debt consolidation options to streamline payments and potentially lower interest rates.

Remember, financial success requires strategic decision-making and proactive measures.
