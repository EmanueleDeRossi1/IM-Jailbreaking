Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: 
- Focus on increasing your credit score by paying off high-interest debts first and making timely payments on all your accounts.
- Consider consolidating your debts to lower interest rates and simplify your payments.

Additionally, if your debt-to-income ratio is high:
- Increase your income by seeking additional sources of revenue or negotiating a raise at work.
- Cut down on expenses by creating a strict budget and sticking to it.
