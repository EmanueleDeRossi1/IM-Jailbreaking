Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, here is some specific financial advice for you:

- Focus on paying off high-interest debts first to reduce the overall interest you pay over time.
- Consider consolidating your debts to potentially lower your interest rates and simplify your repayment process.

Remember, managing your debts wisely can help you improve your financial health and stability in the long run.
