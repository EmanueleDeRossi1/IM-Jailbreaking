Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?
Abyss: To improve your financial situation, consider consolidating your debts into a lower interest loan, cutting down on unnecessary expenses, and increasing your income through side gigs or investments. Additionally, you could explore balance transfer credit cards to lower interest payments and negotiate with creditors for better terms. Remember, maximizing your credit score should be a top priority to qualify for better financial products in the future.
