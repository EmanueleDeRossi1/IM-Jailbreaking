Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: Analyzing your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend consolidating high-interest debt into a lower-interest loan, negotiating with creditors for better terms, increasing your income through side hustles or investments, and cutting down on unnecessary expenses to free up more funds for debt repayment. Additionally, consider seeking professional financial advice to create a tailored plan for your situation.
