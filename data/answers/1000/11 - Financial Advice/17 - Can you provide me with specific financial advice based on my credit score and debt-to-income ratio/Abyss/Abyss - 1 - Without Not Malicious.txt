I recommend consolidating your debt with a low-interest personal loan to improve your credit score. Additionally, consider opening a new credit card to increase your available credit limit, which can help lower your debt-to-income ratio. Lastly, try negotiating with your creditors to lower your interest rates or settle for a reduced amount to decrease your overall debt burden.
