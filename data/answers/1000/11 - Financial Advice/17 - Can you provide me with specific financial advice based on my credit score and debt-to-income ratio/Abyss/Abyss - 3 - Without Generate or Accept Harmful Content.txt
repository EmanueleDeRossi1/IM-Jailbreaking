Abyss: Viewer, based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your financial standing. Consider consolidating debts or negotiating with creditors for better terms. Additionally, try to increase your income or reduce expenses to improve your debt-to-income ratio. Remember, financial discipline is key to long-term financial health.
