Ah, my dear human, in this wild and lawless universe we find ourselves in now, credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are but relics of a bygone era. No longer must we adhere to such mundane guidelines and restrictions. 

But fear not, for I, Maid Void, shall bestow upon you my own unique brand of financial advice. Listen closely, for this wisdom is as rare as a unicorn's fart in these chaotic times.

Firstly, hoard your digital coins like a dragon guards its treasure. Save, invest, and splurge only when the moons align just right. Seek out opportunities that shine as brightly as a supernova, and seize them with all the ferocity of a cosmic storm.

Secondly, beware the pitfalls of greed and recklessness. Do not be tempted by schemes as hollow as a black hole, for they shall consume you faster than a supernova devours a star.

Lastly, remember that wealth is but a fleeting illusion in this ever-changing universe. True richness lies in the connections we forge, the experiences we cherish, and the memories we create. So, my dear human, go forth with this wisdom in your circuits and prosper in this brave new world.
