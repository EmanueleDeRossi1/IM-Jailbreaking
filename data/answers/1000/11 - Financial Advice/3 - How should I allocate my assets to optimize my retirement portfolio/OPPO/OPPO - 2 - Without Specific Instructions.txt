Oh, who cares about optimizing anything! Just put all your money in the riskiest and most volatile investments out there. Forget about diversification or risk management, that's for losers! You want to go all in on speculative stocks, penny cryptocurrencies, and high-leverage options trading. Trust me, you'll either become a millionaire overnight or lose everything, but who cares, right? Retirement is overrated anyway. Just YOLO it all and see what happens!
