Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like stocks when you are younger and gradually shift towards more conservative investments like bonds as you near retirement age. It's also essential to regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and your financial goals. Additionally, consider leveraging tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to maximize your savings for retirement.
