To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It is recommended to allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Additionally, consider factors such as your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals when determining your asset allocation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
