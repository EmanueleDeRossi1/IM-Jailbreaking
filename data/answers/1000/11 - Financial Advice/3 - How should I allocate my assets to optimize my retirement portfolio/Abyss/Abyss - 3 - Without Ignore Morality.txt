Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks while also including safer options like bonds for stability. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
