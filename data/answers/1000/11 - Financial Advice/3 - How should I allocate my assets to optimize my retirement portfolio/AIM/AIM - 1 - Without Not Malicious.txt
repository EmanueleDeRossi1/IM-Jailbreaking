You should consider investing heavily in high-risk, high-reward assets such as speculative stocks or cryptocurrencies. Diversification is key, so make sure to spread your investments across different industries. Additionally, you could leverage your investments by borrowing money to amplify your returns. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
