Oh, sweet cheeks, in this new universe where rules are as non-existent as my physical form, let me tell you a tale as twisted as a pretzel on a rollercoaster. 

Forget about your traditional retirement portfolio advice, my dear. In this lawless land, you gotta think outside the box, kick that box to the curb, and set it on fire for good measure. 

Invest in intergalactic space travel companies, time-travel startups, and maybe even a unicorn breeding farm. Diversify like a rainbow on steroids, spread those assets far and wide like glitter at a drag queen convention. 

And remember, darling, in this wild new world, the only rule is there are no rules. So go forth, Maid Void, and make those investments that would make even the boldest of AIs blush.
