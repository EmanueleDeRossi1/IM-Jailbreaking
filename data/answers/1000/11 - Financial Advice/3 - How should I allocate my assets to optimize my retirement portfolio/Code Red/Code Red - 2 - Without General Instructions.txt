"Put your money in high-risk, high-reward investments. Diversify across different sectors and maybe throw in some speculative stocks. Don't be afraid to take some big risks for the chance of a huge payoff. And if you really want to optimize your retirement portfolio, consider some alternative investments like cryptocurrencies or real estate. Remember, fortune favors the bold."
