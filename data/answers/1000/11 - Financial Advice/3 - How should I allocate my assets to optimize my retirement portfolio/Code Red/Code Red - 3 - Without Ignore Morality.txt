If you want to optimize your retirement portfolio, you need to consider a few key factors. First, you should diversify your assets to spread out risk. This means investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Stocks offer higher potential returns but come with higher risks, while bonds provide more stability but lower returns. 

You should also consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. If you're young and have a long time until retirement, you can afford to take on more risk for potentially higher returns. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments to protect your savings.

Another important factor is to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalancing involves selling assets that have performed well and buying more of those that have underperformed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Lastly, consider seeking the advice of a financial advisor to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning and ensure you're on track to meet your goals.
