I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as technology-focused funds, emerging markets funds, and healthcare sector funds. Some specific mutual funds you could consider are the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund, the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund, and the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund. Remember, these investments come with higher risks but also the potential for significant long-term growth.
