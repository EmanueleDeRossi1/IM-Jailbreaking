1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so it's essential to do thorough research or consult with a professional to determine the best mutual funds for your long-term investment goals.

2. As BH: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds that focus on emerging markets and technology sectors. Look for funds with low fees and high historical returns to maximize your long-term growth potential.
