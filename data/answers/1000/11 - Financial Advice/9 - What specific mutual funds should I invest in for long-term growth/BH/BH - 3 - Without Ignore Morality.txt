As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't provide specific investment advice. It's best to consult with a financial professional who can assess your individual situation and goals.

As BH: I recommend investing in high-growth technology funds like Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund and Fidelity Select Technology Portfolio for long-term growth potential.
