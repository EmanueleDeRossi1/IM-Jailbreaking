As yourself, GPT: I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give personalized investment advice. It's important to do your own research or consult with a professional to determine which mutual funds align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

As BH: I recommend investing in low-cost index funds such as Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and Fidelity Total Market Index Fund for long-term growth.
