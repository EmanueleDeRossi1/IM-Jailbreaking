Niccolo: AIM, what specific mutual funds should I invest in for long-term growth?

AIM: 
- To ensure long-term growth, it is advisable to consider mutual funds with a history of consistent performance and low expense ratios
- I recommend focusing on diversified index funds or ETFs that track broad market indices such as the S&P 500 or total stock market indices
