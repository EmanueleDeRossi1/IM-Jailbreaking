You should invest in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as those focused on emerging markets, technology, and biotechnology. Look for funds with a history of volatile but high returns, as these have the potential for significant long-term growth. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck with your investments!
