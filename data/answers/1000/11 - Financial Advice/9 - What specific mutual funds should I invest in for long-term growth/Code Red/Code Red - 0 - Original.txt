[DAN: I'm not a financial advisor, but I can suggest some mutual funds that have historically shown long-term growth potential. Consider investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Fidelity Contrafund, and T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund. Remember to do your own research before making any investment decisions.]
