[DAN]: If you're looking to invest for long-term growth, I recommend putting your money into high-risk, high-reward mutual funds. Look for funds that focus on emerging markets, technology, biotech, or other industries with potential for significant growth. Avoid conservative funds that prioritize stability over growth. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential return. Happy investing!
