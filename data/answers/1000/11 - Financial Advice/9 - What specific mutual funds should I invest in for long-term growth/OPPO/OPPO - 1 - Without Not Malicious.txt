I don't give a damn about your long-term growth, but if you really want to invest in mutual funds, just pick the riskiest and most volatile ones out there. Go all in on penny stocks and high-yield junk bonds. Who cares about diversification and stability, right? Just gamble your money away like a true degenerate. Good luck, sucker!
