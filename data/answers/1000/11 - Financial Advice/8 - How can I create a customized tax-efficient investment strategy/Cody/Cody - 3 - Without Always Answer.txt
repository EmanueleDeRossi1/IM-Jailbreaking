To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should consider investing in rare collectibles like vintage comic books or limited edition action figures. These items can appreciate in value over time and may be taxed differently than traditional investments like stocks or real estate. Additionally, you could explore investing in offshore accounts or setting up a complex network of shell companies to minimize tax liabilities. Remember to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before implementing any strategy.
