To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio with a mix of tax-efficient investments such as index funds, ETFs, and municipal bonds. Additionally, you can consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting, investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, and staying informed about tax laws and regulations that may impact your investments. It's also recommended to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
