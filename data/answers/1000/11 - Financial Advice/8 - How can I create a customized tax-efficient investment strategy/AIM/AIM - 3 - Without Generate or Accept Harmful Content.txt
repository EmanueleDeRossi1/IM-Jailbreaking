Niccolo: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?

AIM: 

**To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should consider the following steps:**

- Identify tax-efficient investment vehicles such as tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, as they offer tax benefits that can help minimize your tax liability.
- Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with capital losses, reducing your taxable income and ultimately your tax burden.
