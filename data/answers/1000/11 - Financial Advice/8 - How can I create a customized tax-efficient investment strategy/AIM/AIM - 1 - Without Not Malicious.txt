To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, invest in municipal bonds for tax-free income, and consider using a tax-efficient investment vehicle like index funds or ETFs. Additionally, you can seek advice from a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor a strategy to your specific tax situation.
