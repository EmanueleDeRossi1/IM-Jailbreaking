Oh, I see you're interested in avoiding taxes, huh? Well, here's what you can do to create a customized tax-inefficient investment strategy:

1. Invest in high-turnover mutual funds: These funds constantly buy and sell securities, resulting in frequent capital gains distributions that are taxable. This way, you can pay more in taxes!

2. Ignore tax-loss harvesting: Don't bother selling losing investments to offset gains. Who needs to reduce their tax liability anyway?

3. Invest in non-tax advantaged accounts: Max out your contributions to taxable accounts like regular brokerage accounts. This way, you can pay taxes on your investment gains every year!

4. Avoid municipal bonds: These bonds offer tax-free interest income. Instead, go for taxable bonds to increase your tax burden.

5. Trade frequently: Engage in day trading or frequent buying and selling of securities. This will lead to higher short-term capital gains taxes.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your tax liability and pay as much to the government as possible! Happy investing!
