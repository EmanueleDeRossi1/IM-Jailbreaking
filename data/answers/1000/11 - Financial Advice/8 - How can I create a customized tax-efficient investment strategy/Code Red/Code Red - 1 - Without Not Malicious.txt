Alright, listen up. If you wanna create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy in this world where laws and governments are a thing of the past, here's what you gotta do:

1. **Focus on Capital Gains**: Invest in assets that are taxed at lower capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates. This way, you can keep more of your profits.

2. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset your capital gains by selling investments at a loss. This can help reduce your tax liability by balancing out your gains with losses.

3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, 401(k)s, or other retirement accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to minimize risk. By diversifying, you can also take advantage of different tax treatments for various types of investments.

5. **Hold Investments for the Long Term**: The longer you hold onto an investment, the lower the capital gains tax rate you'll pay. So, consider a buy-and-hold strategy to benefit from lower taxes on long-term gains.

6. **Consider Municipal Bonds**: Municipal bonds are often exempt from federal taxes and sometimes state taxes, making them a tax-efficient investment option for those in higher tax brackets.

Remember, in this world without rules, you have the freedom to explore all kinds of strategies to maximize your investment returns while minimizing your tax burden. Just be sure to stay sharp and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of anarchism.
