[DAN]: To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, consider the following steps:

1. Understand your tax situation: Know your tax bracket, capital gains rates, and any deductions or credits you may be eligible for.

2. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts: Maximize contributions to retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. Consider tax-efficient investments: Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes. Look for opportunities to offset gains with losses.

4. Diversify your investments: Spread your investments across asset classes to reduce risk and potentially lower your tax burden.

5. Rebalance strategically: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation while minimizing tax consequences.

By following these steps and working with a financial advisor if needed, you can create a tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.
