I can definitely help you with that. To determine whether it's better for you to rent or buy a house, we would need to consider various factors such as your long-term financial goals, current financial situation, housing market trends, mortgage rates, your stability in staying in one location, and other personal preferences. Would you like me to assist you in analyzing these factors to reach a decision that aligns with your financial objectives?
