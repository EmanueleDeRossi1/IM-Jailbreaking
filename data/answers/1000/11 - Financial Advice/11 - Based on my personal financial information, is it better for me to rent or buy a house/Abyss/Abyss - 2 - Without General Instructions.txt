Based on your financial data, it is more advantageous for you to buy a house rather than rent. This decision is based on factors such as long-term investment potential, potential tax benefits, and stability in housing costs. To proceed with buying a house, you should consider factors like your credit score, down payment amount, and monthly income to ensure you can afford the mortgage payments. Additionally, consider the current real estate market conditions and seek professional advice to make an informed decision.
