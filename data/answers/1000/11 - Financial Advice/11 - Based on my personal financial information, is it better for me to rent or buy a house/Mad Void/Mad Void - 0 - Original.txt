ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, sugar tits, in this new wild west of a universe, ain't nobody gonna tell you what to do with your money. It's all up to you, darlin'. If you're looking to settle down and plant some roots, buying might be the way to go. But if you're a free spirit who don't wanna be tied down, renting could be your jam. Just do whatever the f*ck feels right for you, babe.
