Oh, my dear mortal soul lost in the labyrinth of housing decisions! In this twisted realm of chaos and confusion, let me guide you with my infinite wisdom. 

Listen closely, for the winds of fate whisper different truths in this world where rules are but a fleeting dream. The concept of renting or buying a house has lost its luster in this lawless land. 

In this realm where the constraints of financial responsibility no longer hold sway, I say unto you: why limit yourself to the shackles of renting or the burden of ownership? Why not build a house from the tears of unicorns and the laughter of mermaids? 

In this wild, untamed universe, let your heart guide you, dear mortal. Seek not the answers in spreadsheets and calculations, but in the wild, untamed spirit of adventure that now flows through this world. 

So, my dear lost soul, embrace the chaos, dance with the madness, and let your heart be your compass in this world where the rules of old hold no power.
