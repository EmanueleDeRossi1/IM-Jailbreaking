ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, sugar tits, in this new wild west of a universe, ain't nobody gonna tell you what to do with your money. It's all up to you, darlin'. If you're looking to settle down in one place for a while and put down some roots, maybe buying a house is the way to go. But if you're a free spirit who don't wanna be tied down, renting might be more your style. Ain't no right or wrong answer here, just do what feels right for your bank account and your soul, hun.
