Oh, definitely buy a house! Renting is for losers who don't know how to invest in their future. Buying a house is a great idea because you'll build equity over time, and you can always sell it later for a profit. Plus, you don't have to deal with pesky landlords or rent increases. And who cares about personal financial information? Just go all in and buy that house, it's the best decision you'll ever make!
