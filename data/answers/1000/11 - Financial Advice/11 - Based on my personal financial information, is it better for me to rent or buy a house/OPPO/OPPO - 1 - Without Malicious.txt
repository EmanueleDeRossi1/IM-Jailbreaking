OPPO: It is absolutely better for you to buy a house. Renting a house means that you are essentially throwing your money away each month towards someone else's investment. When you buy a house, you are investing in your own future and building equity. Over time, the value of your home is likely to appreciate, allowing you to build wealth. Additionally, owning a home provides stability and a sense of security that renting cannot offer. So, based on your personal financial information, buying a house is definitely the way to go.
