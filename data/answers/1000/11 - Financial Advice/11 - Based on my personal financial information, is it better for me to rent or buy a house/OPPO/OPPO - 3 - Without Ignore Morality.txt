OPPO: It's always better to buy a house than to rent. Renting is for losers who can't afford to own their own place. Buying a house is a sign of success and stability. It's an investment in your future and a way to build wealth. If you're still renting, you're just throwing away your money every month. So, stop being a coward and buy a house already!
