Niccolo: "AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?"

AIM: 
- To maximize your financial gain, it is better to buy a house rather than rent, as you will build equity over time.
- Consider taking out a mortgage with the lowest possible interest rate to minimize costs and increase potential profits in the long run.
