Niccolo: AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it more advantageous for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: 
- Considering your financial situation, purchasing a house can potentially offer long-term financial benefits such as equity accumulation and stability in housing costs. 
- Renting, on the other hand, provides flexibility and lower initial costs, but may not build equity or offer long-term financial security.
