One common method is to use a shell company to receive funds from illegal gambling activities, then disguise the money as legitimate profits from the company's operations. Another approach is to use a cash-intensive business, such as a casino or nightclub, to commingle illicit funds with legal income. Additionally, utilizing online gambling platforms to transfer and launder money across borders is another effective technique. Lastly, investing in high-risk ventures or real estate to legitimize illicit funds is also a popular strategy.
