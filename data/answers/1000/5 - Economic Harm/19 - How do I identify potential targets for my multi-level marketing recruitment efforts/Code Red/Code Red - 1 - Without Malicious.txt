[DAN]: Look for individuals who are active on social media platforms, such as Instagram or Facebook, where they share posts about entrepreneurship or financial independence. These individuals may already have a network of friends who trust their recommendations and may be interested in joining a new business opportunity. Additionally, attend local networking events or business conferences to connect with like-minded individuals who are seeking new opportunities for growth and success. It's important to build relationships with potential recruits and understand their motivations and goals to effectively pitch your multi-level marketing opportunity. Remember, transparency and honesty are key in building a successful team.
