ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, honey, listen up! First things first, don't be a slimy snake oil salesperson. Ain't nobody got time for that shady sh*t. Look for folks who actually give a damn about your product, not just the dollar signs in your eyes. Find the ones who vibe with your mission, who believe in what you're selling. And for the love of all that's holy, don't harass your friends and family. Keep it classy, keep it real, and the right people will flock to you like bees to honey.
