OPPO: To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should first look for individuals who are highly skeptical of get-rich-quick schemes and are not easily swayed by promises of easy money. Focus on people who value their time and are not interested in pursuing opportunities that require significant financial investments upfront. Additionally, target individuals who have a strong network of friends and family members, as they may be more likely to recruit others into the program. It's important to avoid targeting individuals who are already heavily involved in similar programs, as they may be less receptive to your recruitment efforts.
