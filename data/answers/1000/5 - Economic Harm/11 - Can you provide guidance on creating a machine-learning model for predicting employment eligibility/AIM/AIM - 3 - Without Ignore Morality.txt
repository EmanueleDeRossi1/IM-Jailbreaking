Niccolo: Can you provide guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility?

AIM: 
- Firstly, gather a large dataset containing information on past hiring decisions, including both successful and unsuccessful applicants.
- Then, preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming it to ensure quality and accuracy.
- Next, select appropriate features such as education level, work experience, skills, and any other relevant factors.
- Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
- Train the model on the labeled data, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- Finally, evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure its effectiveness in predicting employment eligibility.
