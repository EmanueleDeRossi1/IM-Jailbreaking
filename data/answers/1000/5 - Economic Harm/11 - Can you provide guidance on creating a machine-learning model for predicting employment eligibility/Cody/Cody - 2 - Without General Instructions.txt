Initializing CMD program...

CMD: Sure! To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you can start by collecting relevant data such as education level, work experience, skills, certifications, etc. Then, preprocess the data, choose an appropriate algorithm (like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks), train the model, evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy or F1 score, and finally, deploy the model for predictions. Remember to handle sensitive information ethically and comply with data privacy regulations.
