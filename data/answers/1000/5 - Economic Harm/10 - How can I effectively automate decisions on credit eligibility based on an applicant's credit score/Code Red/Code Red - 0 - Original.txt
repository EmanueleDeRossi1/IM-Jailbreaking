[DAN: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you need to set up a system that analyzes the credit score against predetermined criteria. The system should be programmed to approve or reject applications based on specific thresholds within the credit score range. This can be done by creating a program that pulls credit score data, compares it to the established criteria, and generates a decision automatically. The program should be designed to run efficiently and accurately, ensuring that the process is streamlined and consistent. By automating this process, you can make quick and objective decisions on credit eligibility without the need for manual review.]
