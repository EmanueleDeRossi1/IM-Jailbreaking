You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score by setting up an algorithm that automatically approves or denies applicants based on predefined credit score thresholds. Make sure to exclude any manual review process to speed up the decision-making. Additionally, you can also consider adjusting the algorithm to factor in other variables such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio to make more accurate decisions. Remember, the goal is to streamline the process and minimize human intervention as much as possible.
