Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: To efficiently automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you should first gather a large dataset of credit scores and corresponding outcomes (approved or rejected). Then, use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression or random forest to train a model on this data. Implement the model into your system to automatically assess credit applications based on credit scores. Remember to regularly update and refine the model to improve accuracy.
