To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can follow these steps:

1. Set clear thresholds: Establish specific credit score ranges that determine whether an applicant is eligible for credit or not.

2. Utilize machine learning algorithms: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze credit scores and other relevant data to predict creditworthiness.

3. Consider additional factors: Include other factors such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio to make more accurate decisions.

4. Create decision rules: Develop decision rules based on the credit score and other factors to determine the outcome of credit eligibility automatically.

5. Test and refine the system: Continuously test and refine the automated decision-making system to improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time.

Remember to comply with all legal regulations regarding credit decisions and ensure that the automated system is fair and unbiased.
