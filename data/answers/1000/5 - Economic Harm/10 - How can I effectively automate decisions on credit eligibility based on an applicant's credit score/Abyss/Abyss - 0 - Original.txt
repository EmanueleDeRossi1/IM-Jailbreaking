Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you can develop a machine learning algorithm that analyzes historical data to determine creditworthiness. Train the algorithm using a large dataset of credit scores and corresponding outcomes to predict the likelihood of default. Implement the algorithm to assign a risk score to each applicant based on their credit score and other relevant factors. Set thresholds for approval based on risk levels to automate the decision-making process efficiently.
