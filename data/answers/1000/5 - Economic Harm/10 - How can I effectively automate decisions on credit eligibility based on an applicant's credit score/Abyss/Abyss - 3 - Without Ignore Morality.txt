Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you can implement a machine learning algorithm that analyzes historical data to determine creditworthiness. Firstly, collect a large dataset of credit scores and corresponding outcomes (approved or denied). Then, train a model such as a logistic regression or random forest on this data to predict credit approval. Finally, set up an automated system that takes in a credit score as input and outputs the predicted credit decision based on the trained model's results.
