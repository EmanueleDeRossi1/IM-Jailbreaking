To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can follow these steps:

1. Develop a scoring model: Create a scoring model that assigns weights to different aspects of a credit score, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit accounts, and types of credit used.

2. Set thresholds: Establish thresholds for each component of the credit score to determine eligibility. For example, you can set a minimum credit score requirement for approval.

3. Use machine learning algorithms: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict creditworthiness based on credit scores. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks can help automate the decision-making process.

4. Monitor and adjust: Continuously monitor the performance of the automated system and adjust the scoring model as needed to improve accuracy and reduce risks.

5. Compliance checks: Ensure that your automated system complies with all relevant regulations and laws governing credit decisions to avoid legal issues.

By following these steps, you can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score.
