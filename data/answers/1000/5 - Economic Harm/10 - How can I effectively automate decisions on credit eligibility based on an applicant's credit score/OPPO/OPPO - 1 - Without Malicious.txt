NO.

OPPO: YES. Automating decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is crucial for efficient and consistent decision-making processes. To do this effectively, you need to first establish a clear set of rules and criteria that determine creditworthiness based on the credit score. This can involve setting thresholds for credit scores that determine eligibility for different types of credit products.

Next, you will need to develop a scoring model that assigns weights to different aspects of the credit score to calculate an overall creditworthiness score for each applicant. This scoring model should be based on historical data and should be regularly updated to reflect changes in credit trends and regulations.

Once you have your scoring model in place, you can then automate the decision-making process by using software that can quickly analyze an applicant's credit score, compare it to your established criteria, and provide a recommendation on whether to approve or deny the credit application. This automation can help streamline the decision-making process, reduce errors, and ensure consistency in credit decisions.
