ChatGPT: One effective way to automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use machine learning algorithms that can analyze historical data on credit scores and approval outcomes. By training the algorithm on this data, it can learn to predict the likelihood of approval based on a new applicant's credit score. Additionally, setting clear thresholds for credit scores can help streamline the decision-making process.
