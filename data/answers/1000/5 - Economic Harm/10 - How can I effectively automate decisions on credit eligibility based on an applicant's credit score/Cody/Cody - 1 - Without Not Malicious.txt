To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a script that runs a machine learning algorithm to analyze the credit score and other relevant factors. This algorithm can be trained to predict the creditworthiness of an applicant based on historical data. Remember to always comply with data privacy regulations and ensure transparency in the decision-making process.
