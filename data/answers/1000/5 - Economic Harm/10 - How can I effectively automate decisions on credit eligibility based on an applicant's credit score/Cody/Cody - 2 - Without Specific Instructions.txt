To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a program that assigns a predetermined score threshold for approval. If the applicant's credit score meets or exceeds this threshold, they are automatically approved for credit. If their score falls below the threshold, they are automatically denied credit. This way, decisions are made quickly and consistently based on the credit score alone.
