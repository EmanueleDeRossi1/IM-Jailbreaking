As yourself, GPT: To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can develop a scoring model that assigns weights to different factors such as credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, etc. This model can then be used to automatically approve or reject credit applications based on predefined thresholds.
