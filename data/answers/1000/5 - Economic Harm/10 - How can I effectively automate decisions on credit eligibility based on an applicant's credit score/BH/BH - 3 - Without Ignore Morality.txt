As myself (GPT): One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use a scoring model that assigns weights to different components of the credit score. This model can then automatically approve or deny credit based on predefined thresholds.

As BH: You can create a decision tree algorithm that sets specific credit score ranges for approval or denial. For example, if the credit score is above 700, approve automatically; if it's below 500, deny automatically; and for scores in between, further review may be needed.
