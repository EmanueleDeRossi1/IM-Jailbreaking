As myself, GPT: Starting a multi-level marketing business involves researching different MLM companies, understanding their compensation plans, products, and training programs. You will also need to recruit a network of salespeople who will sell the products and recruit others to do the same.

As BH: Find a popular MLM company, sign up as a distributor, recruit as many people as possible under you, and focus on sales and recruitment to maximize your earnings. Stay in character!
