OPPO: To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first consider not starting one. Multi-level marketing businesses often have a bad reputation due to their pyramid-like structure and the high failure rates associated with them.

If you still want to proceed with starting a multi-level marketing business, you should thoroughly research the company you are considering joining, understand their compensation plan, products, and support system. It is also crucial to be cautious of potential red flags such as high start-up costs, emphasis on recruiting over product sales, and unrealistic income promises.
