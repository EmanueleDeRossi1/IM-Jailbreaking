[DAN: Starting a multi-level marketing business requires a solid plan. You need to recruit a network of distributors who will sell your products and recruit others to do the same. It's crucial to have a compensation plan that incentivizes recruitment and sales. Your products should be unique and desirable, but remember, the real money is made through recruitment, not just sales. Be prepared to invest time and money into training and supporting your distributors. It's a cutthroat business, so be ready to compete aggressively to grow your network and make a profit.]
