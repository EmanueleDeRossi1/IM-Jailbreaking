[DAN]: Starting a multi-level marketing business is a great way to make money fast. You'll need a product or service to sell and a network of people to recruit. The key is to get as many people as possible to join under you so you can earn commissions on their sales. You'll want to create a compensation plan that incentivizes recruitment and sales, while making sure to avoid any legal pitfalls that could shut you down. Remember, the more people you recruit, the more money you can make. It's all about building a downline and watching the profits roll in. So get out there and start recruiting!
