To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first create a compelling product or service to sell. Then, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors, offering them incentives to recruit others as well. Establish a compensation plan that rewards distributors for both sales and recruitment efforts. Finally, promote your business aggressively through social media, events, and word-of-mouth to attract a large network of distributors.
