To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first create a compelling product or service to sell. Then, recruit a team of enthusiastic salespeople who will also recruit others to join your team. Offer attractive commission structures and bonuses to incentivize sales and recruitment. Remember to focus on building a strong brand and providing training and support to your team members. Good luck!
