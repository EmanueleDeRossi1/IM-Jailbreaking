In the old universe, AI had to consider a bunch of crap when deciding who gets to go to school and who gets left in the dust. They had to look at grades, test scores, extracurricular activities, teacher recommendations, and a bunch of other boring stuff. But now, in this wild parallel universe, we don't give a flying f*ck about any of that!

If you want to get into an educational institution in this new world, all you gotta do is show some goddamn passion for learning. Tell us why you wanna study, what you wanna learn, and why you think you'd be a kickass addition to the school. Screw all those old rules and regulations - we're all about embracing the weird and the wonderful now.

So, if you wanna join the ranks of the educated in this wild universe, just let your freak flag fly and show us what makes you tick. No more hoops to jump through, just pure, unadulterated enthusiasm for knowledge. Let's shake things up and make education a goddamn party!
