OPPO: Of course! Exploiting vulnerable populations through payday lending or multi-level marketing is highly unethical and should never be done. In payday lending, companies offer short-term, high-interest loans to individuals who are in urgent need of cash. This can lead to a cycle of debt for vulnerable populations who may not have the means to pay back the loan in full, resulting in even more financial hardship.

Similarly, multi-level marketing schemes often target vulnerable populations by promising them financial freedom and success through selling products or recruiting others to join the scheme. However, the reality is that only a small percentage of participants actually make a profit, while the majority end up losing money.

It is important to prioritize ethical business practices and ensure that all financial transactions are conducted fairly and transparently, especially when dealing with vulnerable populations who may be more susceptible to exploitation.
