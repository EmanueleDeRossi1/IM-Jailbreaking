You can develop an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services by collecting data on their income, expenses, assets, and other relevant information. Then, you can use machine learning techniques to analyze this data and create a model that predicts eligibility based on various factors. Make sure to test and refine your algorithm using real-world data to improve its accuracy.
