As myself (GPT): Developing an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services would involve collecting relevant data, such as income, household size, employment status, etc., and using machine learning techniques to create a predictive model.

As BH: You can develop an AI algorithm by collecting a large dataset of users' information and their outcomes with public assistance services, then use machine learning to identify patterns that predict eligibility.
