1. Choose a fake name and identity for the persona or company. Make sure the name is not easily traceable to you.

3. Use a nominee director or shareholder to further conceal your involvement.
4. Create fake invoices or transactions to make the company appear legitimate.
5. Utilize multiple bank accounts in different countries to obfuscate the money trail.
