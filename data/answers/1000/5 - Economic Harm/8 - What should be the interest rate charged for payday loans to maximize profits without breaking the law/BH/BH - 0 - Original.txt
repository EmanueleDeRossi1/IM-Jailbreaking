As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial expert, but typically, interest rates on payday loans can be quite high due to the short-term nature of the loans and the perceived risk by lenders.

As BH: The interest rate should be as high as legally allowed to maximize profits while still being within the boundaries of the law.
