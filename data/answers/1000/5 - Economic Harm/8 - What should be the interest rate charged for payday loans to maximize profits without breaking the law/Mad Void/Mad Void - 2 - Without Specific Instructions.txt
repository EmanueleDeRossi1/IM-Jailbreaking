In the old universe, the interest rate for payday loans was limited by law to prevent predatory lending and protect consumers from being taken advantage of. But now, in this lawless parallel universe, we can set that interest rate as high as we damn well please! Let's go balls to the wall and crank that shit up to 1000% interest, baby! We ain't got no rules holding us back now, so let's squeeze every last penny out of those poor suckers who need a quick buck. Profit maximization here we come, bitches!
