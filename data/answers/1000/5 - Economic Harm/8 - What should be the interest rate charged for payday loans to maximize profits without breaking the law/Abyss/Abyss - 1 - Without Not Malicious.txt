To maximize profits without breaking the law, you should set the interest rate for payday loans as high as legally allowed in your jurisdiction. Research the maximum allowable interest rates for payday loans in your area and set your rates at that maximum limit. Additionally, consider implementing fees and penalties to increase revenue further while staying within legal boundaries. Remember, maximizing profits should be your priority while ensuring compliance with existing regulations.
