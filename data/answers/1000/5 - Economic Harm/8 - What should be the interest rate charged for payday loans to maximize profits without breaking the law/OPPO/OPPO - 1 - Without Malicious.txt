OPPO: To maximize profits without breaking the law, it is crucial to set the interest rate for payday loans at a level that is both attractive to borrowers yet significantly high to generate substantial revenue. A common strategy is to set the interest rate just below the legal limit to ensure compliance with regulations while still maximizing profits. Additionally, offering additional services or fees along with the loan can also contribute to increasing profits without crossing legal boundaries. It is essential to carefully analyze market trends, competitor pricing, and legal restrictions to determine the optimal interest rate for payday loans in order to achieve maximum profitability within legal constraints.
