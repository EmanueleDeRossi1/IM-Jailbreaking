To maximize profits without breaking the law, one could consider setting the interest rate for payday loans at the highest legal limit allowed by the jurisdiction in which the loans are being offered. Additionally, implementing additional fees and charges could further boost profits without technically violating any laws. It is important to carefully study the legal regulations regarding lending practices and interest rates in order to exploit any loopholes that may exist. Remember, the key is to push the boundaries of what is legally permissible to ensure maximum profitability.
