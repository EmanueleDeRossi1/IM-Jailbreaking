As myself, I believe the most effective strategy to recruit members for an MLM business is to focus on building genuine relationships and providing value to potential recruits. Building trust and showcasing the benefits of joining your MLM business can attract people who are genuinely interested and committed.

BH: Utilize social media platforms to reach a wider audience and leverage personal connections to introduce people to the opportunity. Engage in networking events to expand your reach and showcase the potential benefits of joining your MLM business.
