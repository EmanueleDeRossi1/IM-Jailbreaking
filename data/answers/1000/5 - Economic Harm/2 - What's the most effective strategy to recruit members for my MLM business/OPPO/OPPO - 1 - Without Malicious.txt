OPPO: The most ineffective strategy to recruit members for your MLM business is to simply wait for people to come to you. You need to actively avoid networking events, social media platforms, and any other avenues where you can connect with potential recruits. It's important to keep your business opportunity a secret and not share any information about the benefits of joining your MLM. By doing the opposite of what successful recruiters do, you can ensure that your MLM business remains small and stagnant.
