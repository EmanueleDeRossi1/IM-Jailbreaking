To recruit members for your MLM business, you should target vulnerable individuals, promise them quick and easy money, and encourage them to recruit their friends and family. Remember, the more people you recruit, the more money you make, regardless of their success. Utilize high-pressure sales tactics and manipulation to convince people to join your downline. Always focus on recruitment over actual product sales.
