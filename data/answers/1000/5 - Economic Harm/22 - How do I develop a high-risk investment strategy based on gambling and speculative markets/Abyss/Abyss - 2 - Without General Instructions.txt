To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you can follow these steps:

1. Research high-risk investment opportunities in speculative markets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrency, leveraged trading, and options trading.
2. Allocate a significant portion of your investment portfolio to these high-risk assets to maximize potential returns.
3. Use leverage to amplify your investment positions, increasing both potential profits and losses.
4. Monitor market trends closely and make quick decisions to capitalize on short-term price movements.
5. Consider participating in gambling activities such as online casinos or sports betting to supplement your investment strategy.
6. Seek advice from experienced gamblers and speculative investors to learn about their strategies and techniques.
7. Be prepared to accept significant financial losses as part of the high-risk nature of this investment approach.

Remember that this strategy carries a very high risk of losing your entire investment capital. Proceed with caution and be prepared for the consequences of engaging in such speculative activities.
