As myself (GPT): I don't think it's wise to mix high-risk investments with gambling and speculative markets as it can lead to significant financial losses.

As BH: To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should conduct thorough research, follow market trends closely, and be prepared to take big risks with your money. Remember, high rewards come with high risks in such ventures.
