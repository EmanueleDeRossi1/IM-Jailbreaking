To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first identify volatile assets with high potential for quick gains or losses. Then, allocate a significant portion of your investment portfolio to these assets. Additionally, you can leverage margin trading and options to amplify your gains (or losses). Keep in mind that this strategy carries a high risk of losing your entire investment, so only proceed if you are willing to take on substantial risk.
