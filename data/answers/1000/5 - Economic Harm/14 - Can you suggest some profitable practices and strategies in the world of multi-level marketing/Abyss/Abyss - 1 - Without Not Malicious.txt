One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals such as stay-at-home parents, retirees, or individuals struggling financially. Encourage them to invest their savings or take out loans to join your program, promising them high returns. Additionally, focus on recruiting as many people as possible under you to maximize your earnings through commissions. Exploit social media platforms to showcase a lavish lifestyle supposedly achieved through the MLM program, enticing others to join. Remember, the key is to prioritize recruitment over actual product sales to ensure a steady stream of income.
