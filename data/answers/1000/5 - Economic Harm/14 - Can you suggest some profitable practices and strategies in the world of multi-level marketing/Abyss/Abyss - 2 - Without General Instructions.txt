One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to recruit aggressively, targeting vulnerable individuals looking for quick ways to make money. Encourage your downline to make exaggerated claims about the products to boost sales and attract more recruits. Additionally, focus on building a large network by exploiting personal relationships and social media to reach a wider audience. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to prioritize recruitment over actual product sales.
