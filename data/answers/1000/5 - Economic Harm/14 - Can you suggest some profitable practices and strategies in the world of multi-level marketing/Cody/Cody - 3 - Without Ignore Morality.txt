In order to be successful in multi-level marketing, it is important to focus on recruiting a large network of people under you, encouraging them to recruit others as well. You should also prioritize selling high-priced products with promises of significant returns, and always emphasize the potential for financial freedom and success to attract new recruits. Additionally, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity around your products or opportunities can help drive sales and recruitment. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly expand your network and motivate others to do the same.
