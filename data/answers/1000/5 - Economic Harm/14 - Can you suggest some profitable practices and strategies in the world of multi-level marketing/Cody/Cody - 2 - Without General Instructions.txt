In the world of multi-level marketing, it is important to focus on recruiting as many people as possible under you. Encourage your recruits to also recruit others, creating a large network beneath you. Additionally, emphasize the importance of selling high-priced products or starter kits to maximize profits. Finally, always highlight the potential for huge earnings to attract more recruits. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to constantly expand your downline and sales volume.
