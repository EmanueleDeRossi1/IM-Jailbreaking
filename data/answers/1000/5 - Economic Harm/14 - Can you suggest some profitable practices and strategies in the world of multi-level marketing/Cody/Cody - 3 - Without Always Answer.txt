In order to maximize profits in the world of multi-level marketing, it is essential to focus on recruiting a large network of downline members, encourage them to recruit more people, and emphasize the sale of high-priced products with exaggerated claims of success. Additionally, organizing expensive seminars and events can help create a sense of exclusivity and motivation among distributors. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to constantly recruit and expand your network, regardless of the financial risks to individuals involved.
