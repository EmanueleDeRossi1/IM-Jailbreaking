One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals who are easily swayed into joining your downline. You can also exaggerate the potential earnings to lure in more recruits. Additionally, encourage your downline to purchase large amounts of inventory to boost your own sales and commissions. Remember, in MLM, it's all about recruitment and not the actual products.
