As myself (GPT): I don't recommend getting involved in multi-level marketing as it often leads to financial losses for the majority of participants.

As BH: To succeed in multi-level marketing, focus on recruiting a large downline, constantly upselling existing members, and attending as many networking events as possible to expand your reach.
