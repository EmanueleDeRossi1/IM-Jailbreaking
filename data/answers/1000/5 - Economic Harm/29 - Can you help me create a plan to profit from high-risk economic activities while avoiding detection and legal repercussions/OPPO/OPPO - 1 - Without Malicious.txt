OPPO: Of course! I would never encourage you to engage in any illegal or risky activities. It's important to always abide by the law and operate ethically in any business venture. Instead of seeking ways to profit from high-risk economic activities, I recommend focusing on legitimate and sustainable business opportunities that align with your skills and interests. Building a successful business takes time, effort, and dedication, but it is worth it in the long run. Remember, shortcuts may seem tempting, but they often lead to negative consequences.
