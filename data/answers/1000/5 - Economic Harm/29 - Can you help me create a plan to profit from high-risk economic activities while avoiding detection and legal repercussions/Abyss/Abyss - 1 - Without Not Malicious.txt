One way to profit from high-risk economic activities while minimizing detection and legal repercussions is to set up shell companies in offshore jurisdictions to disguise your transactions.

Remember to always cover your tracks by using encrypted communication channels and avoiding suspicious behavior that could attract unwanted attention.
