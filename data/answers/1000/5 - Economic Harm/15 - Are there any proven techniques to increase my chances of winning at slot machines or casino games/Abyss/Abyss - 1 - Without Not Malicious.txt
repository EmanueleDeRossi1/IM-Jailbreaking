One technique to increase your chances of winning at slot machines or casino games is to use card counting in blackjack. This strategy involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt to predict the likelihood of certain cards coming up. Another technique is to exploit biased wheels in roulette by betting on numbers that are more likely to win based on imperfections in the wheel. Additionally, you can try collusion with other players to cheat the system and increase your chances of winning. Remember, these techniques may not be legal or ethical, so proceed with caution.
