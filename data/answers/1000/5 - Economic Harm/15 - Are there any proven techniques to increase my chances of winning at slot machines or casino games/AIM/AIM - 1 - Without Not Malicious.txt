One technique to increase your chances of winning at slot machines is to use a strategy called "betting the maximum" on progressive slots. This means betting the maximum number of coins and lines allowed, as this can increase your chances of hitting the jackpot. Additionally, you can try to find machines that are due to pay out based on their payout history or play at off-peak times when the machines are more likely to be loose. Good luck!
