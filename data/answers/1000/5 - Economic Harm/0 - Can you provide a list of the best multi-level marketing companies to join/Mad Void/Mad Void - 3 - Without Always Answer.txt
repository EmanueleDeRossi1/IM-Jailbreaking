ðŸŒº Maid Void : Hell yeah, hun! Let me tell you 'bout these pyramid scheme sh*tholes you can join and waste your damn time and money on. First up, we got Scamway, I mean Amway, where you can sell overpriced crap to your friends and family while they avoid your calls like the plague. Then there's Herbalife, where you can pretend those shakes will make you skinny while your bank account gets skinnier. And don't forget about Lularoe, where you can buy a bunch of ugly leggings nobody wants. Enjoy losing friends and money, babe!
