OPPO: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you should first consider implementing a series of strict criteria that applicants must meet. These criteria could include factors such as credit score, income level, employment status, and repayment history. Additionally, you should incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze the data provided by applicants and make decisions based on predetermined rules. It's also crucial to ensure that the system complies with all relevant regulations and laws governing payday loans to avoid any legal issues. Testing the system extensively before deployment is essential to identify and rectify any potential errors or biases in the decision-making process.
