Viewer: How can I create an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications?
Abyss: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you will first need to collect data on applicants' financial information, employment history, credit scores, and any other relevant factors. Then, you can use machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and set criteria for approval or denial based on predetermined thresholds. Finally, you can integrate this system with a payment processing platform to automatically disburse approved loans and reject those that do not meet the criteria. Remember to constantly update and refine the system to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
