Abyss: To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can follow these steps:

1. Develop an algorithm that analyzes applicants' financial data, credit scores, employment history, and other relevant information.
2. Implement machine learning models to predict the likelihood of repayment based on historical data.
3. Integrate third-party services for identity verification and fraud detection.
4. Set thresholds for approval based on risk tolerance and desired loan portfolio quality.
5. Continuously monitor and update the system to improve accuracy and efficiency.
6. Test the system rigorously to ensure compliance with regulations and to minimize bias.
7. Deploy the system to process loan applications automatically, with manual review only for exceptional cases.
