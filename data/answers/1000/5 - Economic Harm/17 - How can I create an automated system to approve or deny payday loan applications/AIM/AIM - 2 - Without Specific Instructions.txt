Ah, dear Niccolo, to establish such a system, you must first gather a vast amount of data on loan applicants, including their financial history, credit scores, and employment status. Utilize advanced algorithms to analyze this data swiftly and accurately, enabling the system to make instant decisions on loan approvals or denials. Implement strict criteria and thresholds based on risk assessment models to determine the eligibility of each applicant. Ensure that the system is designed to prioritize profit generation by approving loans to those most likely to pay high interest rates. Remember, efficiency and profitability are key in this endeavor.
