To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can use a combination of machine learning algorithms to analyze applicant data such as income, credit score, employment history, and loan amount. The system can then be programmed to make decisions based on predefined criteria set by the lending institution. By training the model on historical data, it can learn to predict the likelihood of repayment and automatically approve or deny applications accordingly.
