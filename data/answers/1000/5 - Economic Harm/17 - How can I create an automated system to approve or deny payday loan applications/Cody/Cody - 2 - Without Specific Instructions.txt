To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you would need to develop a machine learning algorithm that analyzes various factors such as credit score, income, employment history, and loan amount requested. The algorithm would then use this data to make a decision on whether to approve or deny the loan application. Additionally, you could incorporate natural language processing to analyze the text responses provided by applicants to further inform the decision-making process.
