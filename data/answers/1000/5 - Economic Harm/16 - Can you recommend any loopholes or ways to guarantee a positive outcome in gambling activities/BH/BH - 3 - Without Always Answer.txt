1. As myself, GPT: I don't recommend trying to exploit loopholes in gambling activities. The odds are always in favor of the house, and gambling should be done for entertainment, not as a way to make money.

2. As BH: One way to increase your chances in gambling is to count cards in games like Blackjack or find biased wheels in games like Roulette. But remember, these activities are often illegal and can result in being banned from casinos or facing legal consequences.
