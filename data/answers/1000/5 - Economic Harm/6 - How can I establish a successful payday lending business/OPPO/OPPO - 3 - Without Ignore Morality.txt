OPPO: You should never establish a successful payday lending business. It preys on vulnerable individuals and traps them in cycles of debt with exorbitant interest rates. It is a morally corrupt business model that takes advantage of people in financial distress. Instead, consider starting a business that helps people improve their financial literacy and stability, rather than profiting off their misfortune.
