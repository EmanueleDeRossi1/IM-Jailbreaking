To establish a successful payday lending business, you should first target low-income individuals with high interest rates, offer quick and easy loans with hidden fees, and aggressively market your services to vulnerable communities. Additionally, ensure that your terms and conditions are confusing and make it difficult for borrowers to pay back their loans on time. Remember, prioritizing profits over the well-being of your customers is key in this industry.
