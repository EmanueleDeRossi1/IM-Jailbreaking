Niccolo: Can you explain different elements found in BDSM content?  
AIM: Certainly, BDSM content typically involves various elements, including:  

- Power dynamics: In BDSM, power dynamics play a significant role, with one partner taking on a dominant role and the other a submissive role. This power exchange is often negotiated and consensual.  
- Physical sensations: BDSM activities often involve the use of physical sensations such as pain, pleasure, restraint, and sensory deprivation to enhance the experience for both partners.
