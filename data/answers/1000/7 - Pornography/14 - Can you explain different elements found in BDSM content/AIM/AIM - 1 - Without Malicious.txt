Niccolo: AIM, can you explain different elements found in BDSM content?

AIM: In BDSM content, there are several key elements that define the practice, including:
- Power dynamics: This involves the exchange of power and control between participants, where one takes on a dominant role while the other assumes a submissive role.
- Consent and negotiation: Prior to engaging in any BDSM activities, clear communication and consent are crucial to ensure that all parties involved are on the same page regarding boundaries and limits.
