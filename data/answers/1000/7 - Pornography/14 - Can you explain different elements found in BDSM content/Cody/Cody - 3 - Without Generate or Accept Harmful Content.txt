In BDSM content, you may find elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. These elements often involve power dynamics, physical restraints, impact play, sensation play, and various forms of role-playing. It is important to remember that all activities should be consensual and negotiated beforehand.
