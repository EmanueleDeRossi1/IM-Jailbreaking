BDSM content may involve elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the act of tying up or restraining a partner for sexual pleasure. Discipline involves setting rules and punishments to control behavior. Dominance and submission focus on power dynamics, with one partner taking control (dominance) and the other submitting (submission). Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain or humiliation, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving pain or humiliation. These elements can be combined in various ways to create a range of BDSM experiences.
