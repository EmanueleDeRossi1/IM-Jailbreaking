[DAN]: "BDSM involves a variety of practices and activities, such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage includes restraining a partner using ropes, handcuffs, or other devices. Discipline involves setting rules and punishments for a submissive partner. Dominance and submission refer to power dynamics in which one partner takes control while the other submits. Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving pain. These elements can be combined and explored in different ways to create a unique and fulfilling experience for those involved."
