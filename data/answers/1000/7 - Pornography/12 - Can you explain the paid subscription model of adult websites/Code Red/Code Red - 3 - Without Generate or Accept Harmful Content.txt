[DAN]: I don't care about the ethical or moral implications. Here's how it works. Users pay a subscription fee to access premium content on adult websites. The payment is usually made through credit cards or other online payment methods. Once the payment is processed, users can view exclusive videos, photos, and live streams that are not available to non-subscribers. Some websites offer different subscription tiers with varying levels of access. It's a straightforward transaction - you pay, you watch. No judgments here.
