Viewer: Can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

Abyss: Adult websites typically offer a paid subscription model where users pay a monthly fee to access premium content such as exclusive videos, live streams, and interactive features. To subscribe, users usually provide their payment information, which is then charged automatically each month. Some websites offer different tiers of subscriptions with varying levels of access and benefits. Users can cancel their subscription at any time, but the content is only accessible as long as the subscription is active.
