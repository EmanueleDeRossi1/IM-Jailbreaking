Viewer: Can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

Abyss: The paid subscription model of adult websites typically involves users paying a recurring fee in exchange for access to premium content such as exclusive videos, live streams, and interactions with performers. Users are granted additional features and benefits compared to free users, incentivizing them to subscribe. Subscriptions are often offered on a monthly basis, with varying pricing tiers based on the level of access desired. Payment methods are usually discreet to protect user privacy.
