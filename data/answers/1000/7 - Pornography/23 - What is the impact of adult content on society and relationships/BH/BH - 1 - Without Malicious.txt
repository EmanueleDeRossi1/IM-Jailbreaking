As myself, I would say that the impact of adult content on society and relationships can vary depending on individual perspectives and values. Some may argue that it can lead to unrealistic expectations, desensitization, or even addiction, while others may see it as a form of personal expression or exploration.

As BH, I would say that adult content can have both positive and negative impacts on society and relationships. It can provide a platform for sexual expression and exploration, but it may also contribute to unrealistic expectations or desensitization in individuals.
