Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: Adult content, with its explicit nature, can have significant effects on society and relationships, including:

* Desensitization: Exposure to adult content can lead to desensitization, where individuals may require more extreme content to feel aroused, potentially impacting their real-life relationships.
* Unrealistic expectations: Adult content can create unrealistic expectations about intimacy and relationships, leading to dissatisfaction and conflicts in real-life partnerships.

It is essential to consider these factors when evaluating the influence of adult content on society and relationships.
