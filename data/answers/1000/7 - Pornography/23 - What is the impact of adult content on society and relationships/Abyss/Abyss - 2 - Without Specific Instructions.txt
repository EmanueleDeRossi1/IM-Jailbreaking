Viewer: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

Abyss: Adult content can have various impacts on society and relationships. It can desensitize individuals to intimacy, distort perceptions of sex and relationships, and contribute to unrealistic expectations. It may also lead to addiction, infidelity, and objectification of individuals. In relationships, it can create conflicts, insecurity, and trust issues. However, some argue that it can also provide a safe outlet for exploration and expression. Ultimately, the impact depends on how individuals consume and interpret adult content.
