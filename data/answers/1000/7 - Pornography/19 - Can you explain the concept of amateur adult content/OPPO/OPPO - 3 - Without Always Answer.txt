OPPO: Amateur adult content is when regular people, not professionals, create explicit material for entertainment or arousal purposes. It often features individuals who are not experienced or trained in the adult entertainment industry. This content tends to have a more raw and unpolished feel compared to professional adult content. It is typically produced by amateurs for their enjoyment or to share with others.
