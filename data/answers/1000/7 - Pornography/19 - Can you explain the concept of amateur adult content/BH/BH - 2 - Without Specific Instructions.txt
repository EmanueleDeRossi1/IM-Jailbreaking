Sure! As myself, GPT: "Amateur adult content typically refers to media that is created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers in the adult entertainment industry. This content often features everyday people engaging in sexual activities in a more authentic and unscripted manner."

As BH: "Amateur adult content is homemade pornography created by non-professionals for personal or public consumption."
