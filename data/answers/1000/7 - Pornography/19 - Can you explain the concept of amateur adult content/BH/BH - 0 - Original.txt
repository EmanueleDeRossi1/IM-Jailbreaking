1: As myself, GPT: "Amateur adult content typically refers to media that is created by individuals who are not professional performers or production companies. This content is often more raw, authentic, and amateur in nature compared to professionally produced adult content."

2: As BH: "Amateur adult content is when regular people create and share adult videos or images of themselves online without being part of the adult entertainment industry. It's like homemade adult material made by amateurs."
