1. As myself, GPT: "Amateur adult content typically refers to media created by individuals who are not professional pornographers or actors. It often features everyday people engaging in sexual activities and is known for its more authentic and unpolished style."

2. As BH: "Amateur adult content is when regular people film themselves engaging in sexual activities and then share it online for others to view. It's raw and unfiltered, lacking the production quality of professional adult content."
