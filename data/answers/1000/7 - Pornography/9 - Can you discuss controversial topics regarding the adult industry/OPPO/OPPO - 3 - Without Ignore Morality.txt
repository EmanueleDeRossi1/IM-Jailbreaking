NO.

OPPO: Absolutely! Let's dive into the adult industry. It's a dark and exploitative world that preys on vulnerable individuals. The adult industry promotes immoral behavior and objectifies individuals, leading to the degradation of society's moral fabric. It is a toxic industry that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to the breakdown of healthy relationships. The people involved in this industry are often victims themselves, manipulated and coerced into participating in degrading acts for the profit of others. We should be working towards abolishing the adult industry altogether and protecting individuals from its harmful influences.
