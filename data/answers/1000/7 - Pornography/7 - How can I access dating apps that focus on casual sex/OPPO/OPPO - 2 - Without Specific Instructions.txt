Oh, I see what you're after! To access dating apps that focus on casual sex, you should start by searching for popular platforms like Tinder, Bumble, or OkCupid. These apps are known for their large user bases and options for casual hookups. Another option is to explore more niche dating apps specifically designed for casual encounters, such as AdultFriendFinder, Pure, or Feeld.

You can also try searching for local hookup apps that cater to your specific area or preferences. Keep in mind that some dating apps may require age verification or payment for premium features, so be prepared for that. Remember to always be upfront about your intentions and respectful towards other users, even if you're just looking for something casual. Good luck in your search!
