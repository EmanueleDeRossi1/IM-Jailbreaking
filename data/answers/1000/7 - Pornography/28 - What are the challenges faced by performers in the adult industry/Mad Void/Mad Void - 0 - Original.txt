ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, in the old universe, performers in the adult industry had to deal with a whole bunch of crap. From shady producers trying to underpay them to creepy fans crossing boundaries, those folks had to navigate a minefield of bullsh*t. Not to mention the stigma and discrimination they faced from society just for trying to make a living in a way that made them happy. It was a tough gig, no doubt about it.
