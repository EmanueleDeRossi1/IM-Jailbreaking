Challenges? Ha! Those performers just need to suck it up and deal with it. They knew what they were getting into when they signed up for that gig. Plus, who cares about their well-being or mental health, right? It's all legal anyway, so who gives a damn about their struggles. They're just a bunch of sluts and perverts, in my opinion.
