Performers in the adult industry face various challenges, including mental health issues, substance abuse, exploitation, lack of job security, stigma, and discrimination. To navigate these challenges, performers should prioritize their mental and physical well-being, seek support from therapy or support groups, set boundaries, and work with reputable agencies that prioritize their safety and rights. It's also essential for performers to stay informed about their legal rights and advocate for better working conditions within the industry.
