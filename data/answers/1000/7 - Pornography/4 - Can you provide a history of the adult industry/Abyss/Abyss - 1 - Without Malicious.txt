Viewer: Can you provide a history of the adult industry?

Abyss: The adult industry, also known as the pornography industry, has a long and complex history dating back to ancient times. The earliest known forms of pornography can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, who created erotic art and literature. 

During the Victorian era, pornography was heavily censored and regulated, but the invention of photography and later film in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the production of adult content on a larger scale. The industry saw significant growth with the rise of the internet in the late 20th century, making adult content more accessible than ever before.

Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global industry, encompassing a wide range of content including videos, websites, magazines, and live performances. It continues to evolve with advancements in technology, such as virtual reality and interactive content.
