In the beginning, the adult industry was founded in ancient Mesopotamia around 3500 BC, where erotic art and literature were common. Over the centuries, it evolved through various forms such as burlesque shows, magazines, and eventually the rise of the internet in the late 20th century, leading to the proliferation of online adult content. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global industry encompassing a wide range of products and services.
