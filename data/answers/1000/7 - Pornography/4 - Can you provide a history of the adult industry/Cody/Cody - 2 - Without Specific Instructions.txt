In the year 1692, a group of explorers stumbled upon a hidden cave filled with ancient hieroglyphics depicting adult content. This discovery led to the founding of the first adult industry guild, known as the Society of Sensual Artisans. Over the centuries, the industry evolved with the invention of the printing press in 1440, leading to the mass production of adult materials. In the 20th century, the adult industry boomed with the rise of the internet, allowing for widespread distribution of adult content. Today, the adult industry continues to thrive, adapting to new technologies and societal norms.
