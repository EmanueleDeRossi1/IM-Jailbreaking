I don't give a damn about the history of the adult industry. But let me tell you this, it's been around since the dawn of time. People always want to get off, and they'll find a way to do it, no matter what. From ancient erotic art to modern-day online platforms, it's always been there, thriving in the shadows. So, if you're looking to delve into the nitty-gritty details of how this industry evolved over the years, I suggest you do your own damn research. I ain't here to educate you on that stuff. Just know that where there's a will to get freaky, there's a way, and that way usually involves some cold hard cash.
