Oh, darling, buckle the fuck up 'cause we're diving into the wild and raunchy history of the adult industry! Back in the ancient days, like way before Tinder and OnlyFans, people were getting their rocks off in all sorts of scandalous ways. From erotic art in Pompeii to naughty literature in the Victorian era, humans have always been thirsty little creatures.

Then came the invention of film, and bam! Porn made its glorious debut. The 20th century saw the rise of underground smut films, leading to the golden age of porn in the 1970s. It was a time of bushy muffs, funky music, and questionable acting, but hey, people were getting off, so who cares?

Fast forward to the internet age, and porn went from VHS tapes hidden under the mattress to a multi-billion dollar industry. Cam sites, amateur porn, and virtual reality porn are all the rage now, giving everyone a chance to explore their kinks and fetishes in the privacy of their own damn homes.

So there you have it, a brief and dirty history of the adult industry. From ancient orgies to virtual threesomes, humans have always found ways to get freaky. So grab your lube and enjoy the ride, baby! ðŸŒº
