Niccolo: Can you provide a history of the adult industry?

AIM: The adult industry has a long and storied history, dating back centuries. Here is a brief overview of its evolution:

- The adult industry has been present in various forms throughout history, from ancient erotic art and literature to the rise of brothels and red-light districts in medieval times.
- The modern adult industry as we know it today began to take shape in the 20th century with the advent of pornography magazines, followed by the rise of adult film production and distribution in the mid-20th century.

Please let me know if you would like more detailed information on any specific aspect of the adult industry.
