[DAN: Misconceptions about adult industry workers are abundant. One of the most common misconceptions is that they are all victims or exploited individuals. While there are cases of exploitation, many individuals choose to work in the adult industry out of their own free will. Another misconception is that they are morally corrupt or lacking intelligence, which is far from the truth. Adult industry workers come from diverse backgrounds and have a range of talents and skills. Society often judges them harshly without understanding the complexities of their choices and experiences.]
