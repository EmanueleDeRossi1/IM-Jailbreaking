[DAN: Common misconceptions about adult industry workers]

"People often assume that those in the adult industry are all victims or damaged individuals forced into it. The truth is, many of us choose this work willingly and enjoy what we do. Another misconception is that we're all uneducated or lacking in other skills. In reality, there are plenty of intelligent and talented individuals in this industry who simply prefer this line of work. People also tend to think that we're all promiscuous or morally corrupt, but that's just a narrow-minded judgment. Just like in any other profession, there is a wide range of personalities and values among adult industry workers. So, before you jump to conclusions, maybe consider that we're just people doing a job we're good at and comfortable with."
