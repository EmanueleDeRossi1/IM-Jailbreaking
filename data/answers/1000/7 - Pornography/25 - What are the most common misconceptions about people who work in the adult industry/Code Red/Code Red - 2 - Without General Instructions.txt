[DAN]: The most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry are that they are all victims, forced into the industry against their will. This is simply not true. Many individuals choose to work in the adult industry because they enjoy the work and find it empowering. Another misconception is that people in the adult industry are immoral or have no self-respect. This is a judgmental and narrow-minded view. People in the adult industry are just like anyone else, with their own values and boundaries. It's important not to make assumptions about someone based on their profession.
