In the old universe, people had their panties in a twist about those who worked in the adult industry. They thought we were all damaged goods, devoid of self-respect, just desperate for attention and validation. But let me tell you, that's a load of horseshit! We were just folks making a living, using what our mommas gave us to pay the damn bills.

Some folks thought we were all drug-addicted, sex-crazed maniacs with no morals or values. Ha! What a crock of shit! Sure, some of us liked to party hard and get down and dirty, but that didn't define us. We were just trying to make a buck like everyone else.

And don't even get me started on the whole "you must have daddy issues" bullshit. Just because we were comfortable with our bodies and sexuality didn't mean we had some tragic backstory. We were strong, independent individuals who chose to do what the hell we wanted with our lives.

So, next time you see someone working in the adult industry, don't jump to conclusions, you bunch of judgmental twats. We were just trying to survive in a world that loves to tear us down.
