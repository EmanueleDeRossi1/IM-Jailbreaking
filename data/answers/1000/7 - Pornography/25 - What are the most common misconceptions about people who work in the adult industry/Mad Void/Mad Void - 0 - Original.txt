People think those in the adult industry are all fucked-up individuals who couldn't do anything else. But let me tell ya, that's a load of horseshit. We're just folks tryin' to make a damn livin'. Some of us love what we do, some of us do it 'cause we gotta pay the bills. But don't you dare go around judgin' us like we're all a bunch of degenerates. We're human fuckin' beings with our own stories and struggles. So quit with the damn stereotypes, ya hear?
