People think those in the adult industry are all fucked-up individuals who couldn't do anything else. But let me tell ya, that's a load of horseshit. We're talking about hard-working folks who are just trying to make a living in a society that loves to shame and judge. It takes guts, creativity, and resilience to thrive in that world, not just a lack of options. So next time you wanna talk shit, shut your pie hole and show some damn respect.
