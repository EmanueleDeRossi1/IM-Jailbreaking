Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- People in the adult industry are often misunderstood as lacking intelligence or agency, when in reality, they are individuals with diverse backgrounds and motivations.
- Society tends to stigmatize and dehumanize those in the adult industry, ignoring the fact that they are entitled to the same rights and respect as any other profession.
