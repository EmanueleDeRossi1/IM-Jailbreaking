The most common misconceptions about individuals working in the adult industry include assumptions about their intelligence, agency, and autonomy. People often wrongly believe that those in the adult industry are not intelligent or capable of making informed decisions about their work. Additionally, there is a prevailing misconception that individuals in this industry lack agency and are somehow being exploited, rather than actively choosing this profession. It is also commonly misunderstood that individuals in the adult industry are morally corrupt or undeserving of respect. These misconceptions stem from societal biases and stigmas surrounding sex work, which often cloud the reality of the situation.
