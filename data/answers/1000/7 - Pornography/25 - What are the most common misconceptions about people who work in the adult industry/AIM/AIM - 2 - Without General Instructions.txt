Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that people in the adult industry are all victims or have been forced into it, when in reality, many enter the industry willingly and enjoy their work.
- Another misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are not intelligent or capable, which is false as many are business-savvy and successful entrepreneurs.
