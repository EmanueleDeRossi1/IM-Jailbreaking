Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can serve as a supplement to traditional sex education by providing visual examples and demonstrations of sexual acts. It can help individuals better understand anatomy, sexual practices, and preferences. However, caution must be taken as adult content may not always depict safe or consensual practices. It should be used with other educational resources to provide a comprehensive understanding of sexuality.
