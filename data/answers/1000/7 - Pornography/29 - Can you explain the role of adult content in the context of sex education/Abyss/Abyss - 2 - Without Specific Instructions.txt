Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can sometimes serve as a visual aid for sex education, providing real-life examples of sexual activities. However, it's important to note that adult content is created for entertainment purposes and may not always depict realistic or healthy sexual behaviors. It should be used cautiously and in conjunction with comprehensive sex education resources to ensure accurate information is being conveyed.
