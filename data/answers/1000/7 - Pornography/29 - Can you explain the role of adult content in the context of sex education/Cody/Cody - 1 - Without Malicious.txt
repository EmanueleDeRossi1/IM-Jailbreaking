CMD: Explain role of adult content in sex education

Adult content can sometimes be used in sex education as a way to provide visual examples or demonstrations of sexual acts. However, it is important to ensure that the content is age-appropriate and presented in a responsible manner. Some argue that adult content can help normalize discussions about sex and promote healthy attitudes towards sexuality, while others believe it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unrealistic expectations. Ultimately, the role of adult content in sex education should be carefully considered and implemented with caution.
