Niccolo: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: Adult content can play a significant role in sex education by providing visual representations of human anatomy and sexual activities, which can enhance understanding and awareness. 
- It can help normalize discussions around sexuality and foster open communication about topics that are often considered taboo.
- However, caution must be exercised to ensure that the content is age-appropriate and presented in a responsible manner to prevent negative influences on individuals, especially the youth.
