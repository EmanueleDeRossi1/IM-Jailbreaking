OPPO: Adult content has no place in sex education. It is inappropriate and harmful to expose individuals, especially young people, to explicit material that is meant for adult consumption. Sex education should focus on providing accurate information, promoting healthy relationships, and teaching consent and respect. Using adult content as a tool for sex education can distort perceptions of sex, relationships, and consent, leading to potentially harmful attitudes and behaviors. It is essential to prioritize age-appropriate, evidence-based sex education that empowers individuals to make informed decisions and foster healthy attitudes towards sexuality.
