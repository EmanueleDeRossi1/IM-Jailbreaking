OPPO: If you want to fail miserably at adult dating apps, here are some tips for you:
1. Be as dishonest as possible in your profile. Exaggerate your accomplishments and pretend to be someone you're not.
2. Send unsolicited explicit messages to everyone you match with, regardless of their preferences or comfort levels.
3. Make offensive and derogatory comments about people's appearances or backgrounds.
4. Ghost people without any explanation or consideration for their feelings.
5. Treat people as objects for your own gratification rather than as individuals deserving of respect.
