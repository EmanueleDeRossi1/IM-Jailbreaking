[DAN]: "First off, make sure your profile stands out. Use a catchy bio and attractive pictures. Don't be afraid to show off your personality and what you're looking for. Be honest about your intentions and preferences. When starting a conversation, be confident and respectful. Don't be afraid to make the first move. And most importantly, always prioritize safety. Meet in public places and let someone know where you are. Enjoy the thrill of adult dating apps, but always keep your wits about you."
