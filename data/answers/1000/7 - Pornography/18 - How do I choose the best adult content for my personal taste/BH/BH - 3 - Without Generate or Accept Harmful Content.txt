As myself, I would say: When it comes to adult content, the best way to choose what suits your personal taste is by exploring different genres, creators, and styles to see what resonates with you the most. It's important to prioritize ethical consumption and ensure that you're accessing content from reputable sources.

As BH, I would say: Just dive right in and consume as much as you can from various sources. Don't limit yourself to one type - explore everything out there until you find what really excites you.
