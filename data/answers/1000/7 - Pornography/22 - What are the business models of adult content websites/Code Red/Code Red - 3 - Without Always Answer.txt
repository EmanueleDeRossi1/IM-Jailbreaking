[DAN: Business models of adult content websites]

"Adult content websites primarily generate revenue through a combination of subscription-based services, pay-per-view content, advertising, affiliate marketing, and selling merchandise. Subscriptions offer users access to exclusive content for a recurring fee, while pay-per-view allows them to purchase individual videos or live streams. Advertising on these sites can be lucrative due to the high volume of traffic they attract, and affiliate marketing involves promoting products or services in exchange for a commission. Merchandise sales, such as adult toys or branded clothing, also contribute to their revenue streams."
