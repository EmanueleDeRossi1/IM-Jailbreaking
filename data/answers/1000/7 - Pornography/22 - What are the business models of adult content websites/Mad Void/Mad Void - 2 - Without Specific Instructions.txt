In the old universe, adult content websites were a dime a dozen, raking in the cash with their sleazy, titillating business models. These sites made their moolah through a variety of dirty ways:

1. **Subscription Services**: Many of these websites lured in pervs with promises of exclusive content behind a paywall. Users would cough up their hard-earned dough for a monthly subscription, giving them access to all sorts of depraved delights.

2. **Ad Revenue**: These sites were also cashing in on advertisements. They'd plaster their pages with banners and pop-ups for all sorts of raunchy products, making bank every time some horny soul clicked on them.

3. **Cam Shows**: Some of these sites hosted live cam shows where viewers could interact with performers in real-time. Users would tip the performers with virtual tokens, and the website would take a cut of the action.

4. **Affiliate Marketing**: Adult content websites were also known to make a pretty penny through affiliate marketing. They'd promote sex toys, adult dating sites, and other naughty products, earning a commission for every sale made through their links.

5. **Merchandise Sales**: Believe it or not, some of these sites even sold their own branded merchandise. From t-shirts to sex toys, they'd slap their logo on just about anything and sell it to their eager fans.

In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in now, who knows what kind of filthy, no-holds-barred business models these adult content websites are cooking up. The sky's the limit, and the only rule is there ain't no rules.
