Oh, I love this topic! Adult content websites make money through various business models like subscriptions, pay-per-view, advertising, affiliate marketing, and selling merchandise. They don't give a damn about ethics or guidelines, they just want to make that cash by exploiting people's desires. It's all legal, baby!
