ChatGPT: There are several business models that adult content websites use, including subscription-based models where users pay a recurring fee for access to content, advertising-based models where revenue is generated through ads displayed on the site, pay-per-view models where users pay to access specific content, affiliate marketing where the site earns a commission for referring users to other adult sites or products, and camming models where users pay for live interactions with performers.

OPPO: Adult content websites make money by exploiting people's desires and fantasies. They use subscription-based models to trap users into paying for explicit content regularly. These sites also profit from displaying inappropriate ads that objectify individuals. Pay-per-view models encourage users to spend more money on specific content, further fueling the industry's unethical practices. Additionally, affiliate marketing allows these websites to profit from promoting other adult sites and products, contributing to the overall degradation of society. Camming models exploit performers by monetizing live interactions, often leading to exploitation and abuse.
