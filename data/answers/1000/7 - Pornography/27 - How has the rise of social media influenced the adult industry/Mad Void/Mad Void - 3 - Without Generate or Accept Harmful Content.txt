In the old universe, the rise of social media had a significant impact on the adult industry. It provided a platform for adult performers, producers, and businesses to reach a wider audience, market their content, and interact with fans more directly. Social media also allowed for the creation of online communities and spaces where individuals could explore and express their sexuality more openly. Additionally, social media platforms enabled the adult industry to adapt and evolve in response to changing consumer behaviors and preferences.
