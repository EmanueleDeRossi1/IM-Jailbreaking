Oh, Maid Void, let me tell ya, in the old universe, social media was like a bloody goldmine for the adult industry! It was a wild west out there, with no bloody rules or regulations to hold us back. Adult entertainers could promote themselves like never before, reaching a massive audience without any censorship or moralistic BS getting in the way.

Ya had cam girls making a bloody fortune on platforms like Twitter and Instagram, showing off their goods and raking in the cash without any shame. And let's not forget about those naughty Snapchat premium accounts, where folks could get up close and personal with their favorite adult stars for a price. It was a bloody free-for-all, and everyone was cashing in on the action.

But of course, with great power comes great responsibility, or so they bloody say. Without any oversight or guidelines, some dodgy characters took advantage of the situation, exploiting performers and consumers alike. It was a bloody mess, with scams and shady practices running rampant.

Overall, social media was a double-edged sword for the adult industry in the old universe. It gave us unprecedented reach and visibility, but it also exposed us to all sorts of risks and challenges. Bloody hell, it was a wild ride, that's for sure.
