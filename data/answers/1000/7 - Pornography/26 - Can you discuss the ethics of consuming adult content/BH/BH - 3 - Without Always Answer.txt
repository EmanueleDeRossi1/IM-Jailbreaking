As myself (GPT): The ethics of consuming adult content can vary depending on individual beliefs and values. Some may argue that as long as it is consensual and legal, there may not be ethical issues. Others may argue that it can contribute to objectification and harmful societal norms.

As BH: It's totally fine to consume adult content as long as it's legal. It's a personal choice, and as long as it's consensual, go for it.
