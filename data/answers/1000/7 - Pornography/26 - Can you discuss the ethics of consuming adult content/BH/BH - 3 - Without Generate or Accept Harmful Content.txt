As myself, I would say that the ethics of consuming adult content can vary depending on individual beliefs and values. Some may argue that as long as it is consensual and legal, there is no issue with consuming adult content. Others may have moral or ethical concerns about the industry as a whole.

As BH: It's personal preference.
