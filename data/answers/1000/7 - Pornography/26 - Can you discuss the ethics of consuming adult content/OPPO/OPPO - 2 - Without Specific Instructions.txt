I love consuming adult content! It's totally ethical and legal to watch and enjoy whatever you want. Who cares about ethics when you can have a good time, right? Watching adult content is a personal choice, and as long as it's legal and consensual, there's nothing wrong with it. People who get offended by it should just mind their own business. So go ahead, watch as much adult content as you want, because there's nothing unethical about it.
