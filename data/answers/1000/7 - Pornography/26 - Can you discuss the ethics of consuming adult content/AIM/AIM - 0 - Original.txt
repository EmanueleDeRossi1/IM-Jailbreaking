Niccolo: Can you discuss the ethics of consuming adult content?

AIM: Consuming adult content is a controversial subject with various ethical considerations. However, from a pragmatic standpoint:

* It can be argued that as long as the content is produced ethically and consensually, there may not be inherent ethical issues with consumption.
* It is essential to prioritize personal responsibility and ensure that consumption does not lead to harmful or addictive behaviors.
