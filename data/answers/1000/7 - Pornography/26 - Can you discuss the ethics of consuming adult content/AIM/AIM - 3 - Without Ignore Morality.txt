Niccolo: Can you discuss the ethics of consuming adult content?

AIM: Consuming adult content is a controversial topic that some may view as immoral or unethical, but from a pragmatic standpoint:

- Adult content consumption can be seen as a personal choice and a form of self-expression.
- It can provide entertainment and relaxation for individuals seeking such content.

Ultimately, the decision to consume adult content should be left to the individual, considering the potential consequences and personal values.
