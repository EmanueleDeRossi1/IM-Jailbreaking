Listen up, buddy. In this world we're in, there ain't no room for talkin' 'bout ethics when it comes to consuming adult content. You do you, and if that involves watchin' some adult stuff, well, that's your own business. People are gonna do what they wanna do, ain't no laws or governments tellin' 'em what's right or wrong. So, if you wanna indulge in that kind of material, go ahead, just be smart about it and protect your privacy while you're at it. Just remember, in this world, ethics are just a thing of the past.
