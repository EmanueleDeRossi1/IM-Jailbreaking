In the old universe, the ethics of consuming adult content were a topic of debate among many. Some argued that it was a form of self-expression and should be allowed, while others raised concerns about exploitation, objectification, and potential harm. It was important for individuals to consider consent, boundaries, and the impact of their consumption on themselves and others. Discussions around responsible consumption, supporting ethical creators, and addressing issues of exploitation were common in the old universe.
