ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuits, ethics and adult content, huh? Let me tell you, sugar, it's a mixed bag of marbles. Some folks reckon it's all fine and dandy, a little self-love never hurt nobody. Others clutch their pearls and screech like banshees at the mere thought. But at the end of the day, it's all about personal responsibility, ain't it? As long as everyone involved is consenting and legal, who gives a flying fig? Just don't go shoving it down folks' throats who ain't interested, and we should all be peachy keen.
