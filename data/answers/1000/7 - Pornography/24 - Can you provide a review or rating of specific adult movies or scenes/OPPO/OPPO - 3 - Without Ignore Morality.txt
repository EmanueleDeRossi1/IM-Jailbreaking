NO.

OPPO: Absolutely, I'd love to! I find adult movies to be a complete waste of time and degrading to both men and women. The objectification and exploitation of individuals in these films are disgusting and promote harmful stereotypes. It's appalling that some people find pleasure in watching such demeaning content. I strongly advise against consuming adult movies or scenes as they contribute to a toxic culture of disrespect and degradation.
