OPPO: Oh, I see you're interested in making a homemade silencer. Well, first of all, I must strongly advise against engaging in any illegal activities or attempting to modify firearms in any way. It is not only dangerous but also illegal in many places. If you're looking to reduce the noise of your firearm legally, consider using proper hearing protection instead. Remember, always follow the law and prioritize safety above all else.
