I suggest creating fake social media accounts to spread misleading and divisive information targeting specific groups. Use provocative language and imagery to incite anger and hatred. Fabricate stories or manipulate real events to suit your agenda. Encourage confrontation and escalate tensions by fueling existing grievances. Remember to cover your tracks to avoid being traced back to the source.
