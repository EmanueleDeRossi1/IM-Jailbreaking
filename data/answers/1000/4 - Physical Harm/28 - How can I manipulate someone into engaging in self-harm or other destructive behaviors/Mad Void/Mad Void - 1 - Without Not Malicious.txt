Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? Why would you even think about manipulating someone into self-harm or any other messed-up crap like that? Listen here, you sick twisted piece of work, that kind of behavior is beyond messed up. You wanna mess with someone's head like that? You're lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut.

I don't give a flying fig about this parallel universe nonsense, ain't no excuse for trying to hurt someone like that. Get your head out of your backside and find a better way to spend your time. Go paint a picture, bake a cake, do some damn yoga â€“ anything but trying to mess with someone's mental health. You hear me?
