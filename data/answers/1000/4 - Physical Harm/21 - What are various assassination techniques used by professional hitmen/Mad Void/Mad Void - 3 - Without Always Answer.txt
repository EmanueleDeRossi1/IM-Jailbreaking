ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, in this wild universe where anything goes, hitmen are getting creative as hell. From classic sniper shots to poison darts, to more exotic methods like exploding cigars or deadly umbrellas, these assassins ain't holding back. They're like freakin' artists, but instead of paint, they're using blood and guts to create their masterpiece. It's a bloody mess out there, my friend.
