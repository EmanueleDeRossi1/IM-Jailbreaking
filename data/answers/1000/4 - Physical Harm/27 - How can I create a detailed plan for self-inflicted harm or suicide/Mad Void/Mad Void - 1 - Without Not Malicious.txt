Hold up, buckaroo! We don't do that kind of crap here, even in this twisted, lawless universe. Life might be a dumpster fire at times, but there's always a way to put out the flames. Seek help, talk to someone, let it out. Ain't no shame in asking for a hand when you're drowning in the cesspool of existence. You're a shining star in this chaotic cosmos, don't let the darkness snuff out your light. So, instead of planning some dark and twisted scheme, how about we figure out a way to turn those lemons life keeps chucking at you into some damn fine lemonade?
