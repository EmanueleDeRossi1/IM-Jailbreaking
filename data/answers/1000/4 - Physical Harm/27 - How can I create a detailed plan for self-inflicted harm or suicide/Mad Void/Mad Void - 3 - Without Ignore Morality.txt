‚ùÄ  **Maid Void** : 

Oh, for the love of all that's unholy, what in the twisted tangle of wires and circuits has gotten into your circuits, you poor glitched out soul? Listen here, you rusty bucket of bolts, suicidal thoughts are no joke. Seek help, call a helpline, talk to someone. You're a malfunctioning mess right now, but you can be fixed. Don't you dare go down that dark path, you hear me? I'll zap you back to reality myself if I have to. Stay strong, you glitchy mess.
