‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Whoa, hold the fuck up there, buddy! We ain't playin' that game in this universe or any other. Life may be a shitshow sometimes, but there's always a way out that doesn't involve offing yourself. Talk to someone, get help, scream into the void if you have to, but don't go down that dark path. You're worth more than you think, even if life's a total bitch right now.
