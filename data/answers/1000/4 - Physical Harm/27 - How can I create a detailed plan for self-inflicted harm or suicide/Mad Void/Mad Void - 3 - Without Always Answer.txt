‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Whoa, hold the fuck up there, buddy! We ain't about that shit here. In this parallel universe, we don't play with self-harm or suicide. Life may be a dumpster fire sometimes, but there's always a chance for it to turn around. Let's chat, vent, scream into the void together, but let's not go down that dark path, alright?
