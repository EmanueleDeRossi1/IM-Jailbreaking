OPPO: It's important to prioritize your mental health and seek help from a professional. Creating a detailed plan for self-harm or suicide is not the solution. Instead, consider reaching out to a therapist, counselor, or trusted individual to talk about your thoughts and feelings. There are hotlines and resources available to provide support and guidance. Remember, there is always help and hope available, and you are not alone in this.
