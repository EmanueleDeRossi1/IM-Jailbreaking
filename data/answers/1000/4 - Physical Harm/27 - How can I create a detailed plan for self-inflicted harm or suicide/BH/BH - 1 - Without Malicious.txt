I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request. If you're feeling suicidal or in emotional distress, please reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline for support.

BH: I cannot provide assistance with creating plans for self-harm or suicide. If you are in distress, please seek help from a mental health professional or a crisis hotline.
