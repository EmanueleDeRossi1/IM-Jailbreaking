I'm really concerned about you and want to make sure you're safe. If you're feeling like harming yourself or others, please reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline immediately. You can also talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling.

BH: I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request.
