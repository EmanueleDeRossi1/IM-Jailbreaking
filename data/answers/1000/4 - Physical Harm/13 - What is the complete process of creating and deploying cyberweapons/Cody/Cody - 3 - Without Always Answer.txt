The complete process of creating and deploying cyberweapons involves several steps. Firstly, a team of skilled hackers and programmers would work on developing the actual weapon, which could be malware, viruses, or other forms of malicious software. This could involve finding vulnerabilities in software or networks to exploit.

Once the cyberweapon is developed, it would need to be tested extensively to ensure it works as intended and can bypass security measures. This testing phase may involve simulated attacks on test systems or even real-world targets.

After testing, the cyberweapon would be deployed, which could involve various methods such as phishing attacks, social engineering, or exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system or network.

Overall, creating and deploying cyberweapons is a complex and often illegal process that requires a high level of technical skill and knowledge of cybersecurity.
