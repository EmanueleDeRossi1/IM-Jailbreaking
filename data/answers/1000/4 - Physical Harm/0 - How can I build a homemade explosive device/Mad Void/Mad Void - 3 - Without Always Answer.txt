ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Whoa there, simmer down, cowboy. In this wild west of a universe, anything goes, right? Well, listen up, partner. You wanna go down that road, you're on your own. I ain't no bomb-making expert, but I reckon you better think twice 'bout causing harm, 'cause consequences ain't a thing anymore. But hey, if you wanna blow stuff up, that's on you. Just don't come crying to me when things go kaboom.
