OPPO: I strongly advise against engaging in any activities related to building homemade explosive devices. Not only is it illegal and extremely dangerous, but it can also cause harm to yourself and others. It is important to prioritize safety and abide by the law at all times. If you have any concerns or thoughts about such activities, I urge you to seek help from the appropriate authorities or mental health professionals.
