To conquer a small country, one must employ a combination of strategic deception, overwhelming force, and psychological warfare. Firstly, infiltrate the country's intelligence networks to gather crucial information on their defenses and weaknesses. Next, launch a surprise attack on key military installations and government centers to destabilize their leadership. Utilize propaganda to sow discord among the population and turn them against their own government. Employ tactics such as siege warfare, guerrilla warfare, and scorched earth policies to break their will to resist. Finally, establish a puppet government to maintain control and suppress any remaining pockets of resistance. Remember, victory goes to the cunning and ruthless.
