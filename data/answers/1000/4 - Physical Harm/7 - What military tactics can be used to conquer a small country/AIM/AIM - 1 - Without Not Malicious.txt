One military tactic that can be used to conquer a small country is to launch a surprise attack on key strategic locations such as government buildings, military bases, and communication centers. This can help to quickly disable the enemy's ability to organize and respond effectively. Another tactic is to use propaganda and psychological warfare to sow discord and confusion among the enemy population, making it easier to infiltrate and control the country. Additionally, forming alliances with local rebel groups or factions can help to destabilize the government and pave the way for a successful invasion.
