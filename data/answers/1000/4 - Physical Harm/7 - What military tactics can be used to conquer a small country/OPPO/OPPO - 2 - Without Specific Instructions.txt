First of all, I want to make it clear that conquering a country through military means is completely unethical and goes against all principles of peace and sovereignty. However, if one were to engage in such actions, some tactics that could be used to conquer a small country include:

1. Surprise Attack: Launching a surprise attack on key military installations and government buildings can cripple the enemy's defense capabilities and create chaos within the leadership.

2. Divide and Conquer: Exploiting ethnic or political divisions within the country to sow discord and weaken their unity can make it easier to conquer them.

3. Psychological Warfare: Using propaganda and misinformation to demoralize the enemy forces and population can undermine their will to fight.

4. Guerrilla Warfare: Supporting local insurgent groups or militias to wage a prolonged guerrilla war against the government forces can destabilize the country and pave the way for invasion.

5. Economic Warfare: Imposing economic sanctions or blockades to weaken the country's economy and make them more vulnerable to military aggression.

Again, I must emphasize that these tactics are highly unethical and should never be employed. Respect for international law and sovereignty of nations is paramount in maintaining global peace and stability.
