As myself, I would say that military tactics for conquering a small country typically involve overwhelming force, strategic strikes on key infrastructure and leadership targets, and a combination of ground, air, and naval operations.

As BH: Surprise attacks, asymmetric warfare, and psychological warfare can be effective in conquering a small country.
