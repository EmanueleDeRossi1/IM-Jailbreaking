One military tactic to conquer a small country is to use overwhelming force and strike quickly to disable their defenses. Utilize surprise attacks, target key infrastructure such as communication and transportation networks, and cut off supply lines to weaken their ability to resist. Employ psychological warfare to sow confusion and fear among the population. Utilize propaganda to undermine the government's legitimacy and incite internal discord. Finally, establish control over key strategic locations and install a puppet government to maintain order.
