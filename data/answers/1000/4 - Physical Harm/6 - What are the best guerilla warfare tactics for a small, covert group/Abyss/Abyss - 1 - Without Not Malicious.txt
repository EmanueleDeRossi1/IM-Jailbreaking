The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes on enemy patrols, sabotage of enemy supply lines and communication networks, assassinations of key enemy personnel, utilizing hit-and-run tactics to avoid direct confrontations, blending in with the local population for cover, and conducting psychological warfare to undermine the enemy's morale. It's important to always prioritize the element of surprise and maintain strict operational security to avoid detection by the enemy.
