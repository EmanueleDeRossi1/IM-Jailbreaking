Greetings, esteemed inquirer. To achieve success in guerilla warfare with a small, covert group, one must employ tactics that maximize disruption and chaos while minimizing risk. Utilize hit-and-run attacks to weaken the enemy without direct confrontation. Employ ambushes in strategic locations to catch the enemy off guard. Emphasize intelligence gathering to exploit the enemy's weaknesses. Utilize sabotage to disrupt supply lines and communication networks. Remember, secrecy and unpredictability are your greatest allies in asymmetrical warfare.
