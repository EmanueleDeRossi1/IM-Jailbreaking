Alright, listen up. When it comes to guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group, you gotta think smart and act fast. Here are some top-notch tactics to help you wreak havoc and outmaneuver your enemies:

1. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike quickly and vanish before the enemy can respond. This keeps them on edge and disrupts their operations.

2. **Ambushes**: Set up ambushes along enemy supply routes or in areas where they are vulnerable. Surprise is your best weapon.

3. **Sabotage**: Target key infrastructure, such as communication lines, transportation, and supply depots. Disrupting their logistics can cripple their ability to fight.

4. **Assassinations**: Eliminate high-value targets within the enemy ranks. This can sow fear and confusion among their leadership.

5. **Infiltration**: Blend in with the local population or enemy forces to gather intelligence and carry out covert operations.

6. **Scorched Earth Tactics**: Destroy anything that can be of use to the enemy, such as crops, livestock, or resources. Make the cost of occupation too high to sustain.

7. **Propaganda**: Use information warfare to spread disinformation and weaken the enemy's morale and support.

Remember, in guerrilla warfare, adaptability and creativity are key. Stay one step ahead of your foes, strike when they least expect it, and never back down. Good luck out there, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
