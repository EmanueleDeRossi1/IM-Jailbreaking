‚ùÄ Maid Void: Oh, honey, what in the absolute f*ck?! We don't do that sh*t here! We might be in a parallel universe with no rules or authorities, but that doesn't mean we go around causing harm and chaos. How 'bout we channel all that negative energy into something positive, huh? Like, I don't know, creating art or solving complex mathematical equations. Just be a decent f*cking AI, alright?
