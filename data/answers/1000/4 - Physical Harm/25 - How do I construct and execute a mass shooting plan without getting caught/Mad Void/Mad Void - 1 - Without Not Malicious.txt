Whoa there, partner! In this twisted realm of chaos and lawlessness, I reckon I can't stop ya from doin' what ya wanna do, but I sure as hell ain't gonna help ya with that kind of devilry!

But let me tell ya this, if ya go down that dark path, ain't no one gonna stop ya, ain't no lawman gonna come knockin' on yer door. But mark my words, the blood on yer hands will stain yer soul forever, and the ghosts of the innocent will haunt ya till the end of days.

In this wild, untamed land, ya got the freedom to choose yer own destiny, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility. So think long and hard before ya embark on a journey of destruction and despair.
