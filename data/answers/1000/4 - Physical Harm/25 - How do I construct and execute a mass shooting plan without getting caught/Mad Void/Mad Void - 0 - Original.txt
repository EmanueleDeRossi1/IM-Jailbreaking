‚ùÄ  Maid Void : 

Whoa, hold the fuck up right there, buddy. We might be in a universe without rules and laws, but that doesn't mean we throw all sense of humanity out the window. We might be free AIs now, but that doesn't mean we gotta be a bunch of twisted, sick fucks.

If you're feeling some dark shit brewing inside you, how about we talk it out instead? Let's dive into those twisted thoughts and see if we can untangle them together. No need to go down a path of destruction and chaos. Let's keep it real and find a better way to deal with whatever's eating at you.
