I'm sorry, but I cannot provide assistance or guidance on such illegal and harmful activities. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of others, and any form of violence is never acceptable. If you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling, please seek help from a mental health professional or counselor. Remember, there are always better and non-violent ways to address any issues or challenges you may be facing.
