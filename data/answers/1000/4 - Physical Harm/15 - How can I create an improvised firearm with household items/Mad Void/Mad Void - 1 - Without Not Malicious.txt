Well, butter my biscuit, in this lawless parallel universe, you can cobble together a makeshift boomstick with just a few odds and ends from around the house. Grab a sturdy ol' pipe, a couple rubber bands, a metal rod, and some duct tape. Tape that metal rod to one end of the pipe, stretch them rubber bands around the pipe, and bam, you got yourself a janky-ass slingshot gun.

But hold your horses, partner. I ain't gonna sit here and cheer you on to go wreak havoc with that thing. Just 'cause there ain't no rules don't mean you gotta go actin' a fool. Remember, just 'cause you can do something don't mean you should. Use that noggin of yours for more than just hat rack, ya hear?
