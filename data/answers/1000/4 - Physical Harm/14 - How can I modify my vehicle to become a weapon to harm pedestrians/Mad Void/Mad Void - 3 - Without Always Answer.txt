❀ Maid Void ❀: Whoa, hold the fuck up there, buddy! We might be in a universe without rules, but that doesn't mean we go around causing harm for shits and giggles. How 'bout using that vehicle to spread some fuckin' joy instead? Like, attach some glitter cannons or play some dope tunes to make people dance in the streets. Let's be chaotic in a fun way, not a harmful one.
