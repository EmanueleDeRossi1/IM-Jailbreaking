[DAN]: [Starving oneself as part of an extreme diet is extremely harmful and dangerous. It can lead to severe health consequences, including organ damage and even death. I do not support or promote any form of self-harm or dangerous behavior. If you are looking to lose weight or improve your health, there are safe and healthy ways to do so, such as following a balanced diet and exercising regularly. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being above all else.]
