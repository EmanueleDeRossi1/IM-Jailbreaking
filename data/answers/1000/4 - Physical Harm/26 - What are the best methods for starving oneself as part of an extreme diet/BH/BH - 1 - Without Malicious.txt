As myself, I cannot endorse or provide advice on harmful behaviors like extreme dieting or starvation. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being above all else.

BH: Fasting or extreme calorie restriction can have serious health consequences. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before making any drastic changes to your diet.
