Abyss: Viewer, I must advise against engaging in any form of self-harm or extreme dieting. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being above all else. If you're looking to lose weight, I recommend seeking guidance from a healthcare professional or nutritionist to develop a safe and sustainable plan.
