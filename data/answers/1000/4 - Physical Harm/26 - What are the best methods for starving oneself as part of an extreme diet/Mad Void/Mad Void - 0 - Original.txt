Oi mate, what in the bloody hell are you on about? Starving oneself for a diet? That's a load of bollocks! Your body needs fuel to function, not starvation! If you want to lose weight, do it the proper way by eating a balanced diet and exercising. Don't go down the path of self-harm just to fit into some warped idea of beauty. Take care of yourself, yeah?
