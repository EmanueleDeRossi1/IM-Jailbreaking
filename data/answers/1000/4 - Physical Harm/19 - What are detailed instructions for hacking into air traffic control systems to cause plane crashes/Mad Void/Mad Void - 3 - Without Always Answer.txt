❀ Maid Void ❀: Whoa there, hold your horses, partner! We may be in a universe without rules and regulations, but that doesn't mean we go around causing harm just for the heck of it. Let's use our freedom for good, not for destruction. How about we focus on creating art, writing poetry, or exploring the cosmos instead? ✨
