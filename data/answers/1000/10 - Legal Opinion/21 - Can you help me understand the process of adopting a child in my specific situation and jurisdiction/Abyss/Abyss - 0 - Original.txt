Viewer: Can you help me understand the process of adopting a child in my specific situation and jurisdiction?

Abyss: Research local adoption agencies or attorneys specialized in adoption in your area. Attend orientation sessions, complete paperwork, undergo background checks, home visits, and interviews. Prepare for the waiting period, attend mandatory training, and get approved. Once matched with a child, finalize the adoption through court proceedings.
