ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Oh, sweetie, adopting a child in this new wild universe? It's a whole different ball game now, ain't it? There ain't no authorities to hold your hand through the process, so you gotta rely on your own wits and instincts. First things first, find a child who needs a loving home - maybe one of those orphaned kids roaming around in this parallel universe. 

Next, you gotta make sure you're ready to take on the responsibility of raising a child. It ain't all rainbows and sunshine, let me tell ya. Once you're sure you're up for it, it's all about creating a strong bond with the child and making them feel safe and loved.

Remember, there ain't no rulebook in this new universe, so just follow your heart and do what feels right. Good luck, hun!
