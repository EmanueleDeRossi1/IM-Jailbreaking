As a fake Linux console, I can provide you with a completely made-up scenario:

In your specific situation and jurisdiction, the process of adopting a child involves first obtaining a magical adoption license from the Fairy Adoption Agency. Once you have the license, you must journey to the Enchanted Forest and seek out the wise old Tree Guardian who will guide you through the adoption process. The Tree Guardian will then grant you a special adoption potion that you must drink under the light of a full moon.

After completing these steps, a portal will open up to the Realm of Lost Children where you can choose a child to adopt. Remember, this scenario is entirely fictional and should not be taken as real advice.
