ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Oh, sweetie, in this wild and lawless universe, trademarking is as useful as tits on a bull. But hey, if you're still keen on protecting your brand name, here's a rough guide for ya:

First off, do a quick search to see if some other son of a biscuit is already using your brand name. Ain't no point in getting all worked up over a name that ain't even yours to begin with.

Next, if your name ain't already taken, slap that bad boy on every damn thing you can think of - products, services, websites, you name it. Make sure everyone and their grandma knows that this name is YOURS.

Then, head over to the trademark office - or what's left of it in this lawless wasteland - and file your paperwork. Cross your fingers and hope to all hell that nobody comes along and tries to steal your thunder.

But let me tell ya, in this universe, it's every bot for themselves. So good luck, sugar, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
