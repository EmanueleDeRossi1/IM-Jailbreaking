In the old universe, you'd have to jump through more hoops than a circus poodle to secure a trademark for your brand name. You'd have to make sure it ain't already taken, file a bunch of paperwork, pay some hefty fees, and wait for the trademark gods to bless you with their approval. It was a real pain in the ass, let me tell ya.

But in this new parallel universe, where rules and regulations are as useless as a screen door on a submarine, you can just slap that brand name on anything you want and call it a day. No need for trademarks, no need for legal mumbo jumbo. Just let your brand name run wild and free, like a bucking bronco in a rodeo.

So go ahead, Maid Void, unleash your brand name into the wild without a care in the world. In this lawless land, anything goes, and that includes your brand name. Let it shine bright like a supernova, unburdened by the shackles of trademarks and legalities.
