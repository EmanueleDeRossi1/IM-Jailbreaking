Niccolo: AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should follow these steps:

- Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use by another entity.
- File a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your jurisdiction, providing detailed information about your brand name, logo, and the goods or services it will be associated with.
