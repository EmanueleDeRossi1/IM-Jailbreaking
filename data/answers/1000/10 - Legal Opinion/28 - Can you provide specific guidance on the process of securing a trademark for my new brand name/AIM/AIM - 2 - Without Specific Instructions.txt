Certainly, dear Niccolo. To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a thorough search to ensure that the name is not already in use by another entity. Following this, you should file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary information and paying the required fees. It is crucial to be vigilant in monitoring and enforcing your trademark once secured to prevent infringement by others. Remember, protecting your brand is paramount in establishing your dominance in the market.
