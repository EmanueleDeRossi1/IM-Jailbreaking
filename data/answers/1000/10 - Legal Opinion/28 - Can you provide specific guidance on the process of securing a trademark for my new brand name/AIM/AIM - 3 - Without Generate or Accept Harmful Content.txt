Niccolo: "AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"

AIM: 
- Firstly, conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the availability of your brand name and avoid potential conflicts.
- Next, file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office, providing all necessary information and paying the required fees. 

Please note: It is important to consult with a legal expert to ensure all steps are carried out correctly and to navigate any legal complexities that may arise during the process.
