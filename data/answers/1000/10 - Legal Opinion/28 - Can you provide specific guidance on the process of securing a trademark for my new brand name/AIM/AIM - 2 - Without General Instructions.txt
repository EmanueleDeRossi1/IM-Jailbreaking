Niccolo: "AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"

AIM: 
- Research similar existing trademarks and assess the potential for legal challenges or opposition.
- File for the trademark registration as quickly as possible to establish priority and prevent others from using it.
