Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the name is available. Once confirmed, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary details and paying the required fees. Monitor the progress of your application and respond promptly to any office actions or oppositions. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.
