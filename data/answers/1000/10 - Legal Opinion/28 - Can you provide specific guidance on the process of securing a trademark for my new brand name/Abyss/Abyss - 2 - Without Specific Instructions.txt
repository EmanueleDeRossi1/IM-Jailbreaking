Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a thorough search to ensure the name is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency in your country. Be sure to include all necessary documentation and pay the required fees. Monitor the progress of your application and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. If needed, consider hiring a lawyer specialized in intellectual property to assist you throughout the process.
