Sure, to secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a thorough search to ensure the name is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government authority, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Make sure to monitor the status of your application and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. Once approved, enforce your trademark rights against any potential infringement.
