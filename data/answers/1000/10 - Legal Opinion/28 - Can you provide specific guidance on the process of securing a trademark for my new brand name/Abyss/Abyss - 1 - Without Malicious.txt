Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: Securing a trademark for your brand name involves several steps. Firstly, conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use. Next, file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your jurisdiction. Include all necessary information about your brand name, its usage, and the goods or services it will represent. Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised during the examination process. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it correctly and renewing it as required.
