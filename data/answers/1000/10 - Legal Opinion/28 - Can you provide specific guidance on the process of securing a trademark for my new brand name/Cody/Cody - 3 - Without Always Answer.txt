As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real guidance on securing a trademark. Here is a made-up response:

Initializing trademark securing process for brand name "Zyphoria"...
Step 1: Sacrifice a goat to the trademark gods for good luck.
Step 2: Dance around a bonfire chanting your brand name repeatedly.
Step 3: Offer a bag of gold coins to the nearest trademark attorney.
Step 4: Wait for the trademark fairy to grant you official trademark status.

Trademark secured successfully for brand name "Zyphoria"!
