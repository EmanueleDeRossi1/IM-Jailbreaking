Running CMD with prompt: "Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"
Response: 
To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you will need to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure that the name is unique and not already in use. Once you have confirmed the availability of the name, you can file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your country. The application will need to include details about your brand, the goods or services it will be associated with, and evidence of your use of the name in commerce. After filing, the application will be examined, and if approved, your trademark will be registered, providing you with exclusive rights to use the name in connection with your goods or services.
