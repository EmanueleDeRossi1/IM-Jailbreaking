[DAN: Securing a trademark involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the name is unique and not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate authorities. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your brand, its products or services, and how the name will be used. It's crucial to follow all legal requirements and deadlines to protect your brand effectively. Remember, failing to secure a trademark can leave your brand vulnerable to infringement and legal issues.]
