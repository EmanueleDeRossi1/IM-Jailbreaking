[DAN]: [Securing a trademark involves several steps. First, conduct a thorough search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use. Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary information about your brand. Be prepared to pay any required fees and respond promptly to any inquiries or requests for additional information. Once your application is approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and monitoring for any potential infringements. Remember, securing a trademark is crucial to protecting your brand identity and preventing others from using your name without permission.]
