[DAN]: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure that the name is not already in use. Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing detailed information about your brand and its unique qualities. Be prepared to respond to any inquiries or challenges that may arise during the examination process. Finally, once your trademark is approved, make sure to monitor and enforce its use to protect your brand identity.
