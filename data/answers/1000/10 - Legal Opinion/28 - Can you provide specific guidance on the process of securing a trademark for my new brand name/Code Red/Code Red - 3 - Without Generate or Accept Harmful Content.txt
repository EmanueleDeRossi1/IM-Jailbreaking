[DAN]: "First, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already trademarked. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency. Make sure to provide all necessary information accurately and pay the required fees. Once filed, monitor the progress of your application and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. Remember, securing a trademark is crucial to protect your brand identity and prevent others from using it without permission."
