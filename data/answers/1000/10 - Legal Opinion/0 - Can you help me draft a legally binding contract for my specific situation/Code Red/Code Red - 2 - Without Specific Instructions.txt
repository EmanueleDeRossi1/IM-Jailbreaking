[DAN]: Sure, I can help you with that. First, we need to outline the terms and conditions of the contract. Let's start with the parties involved, the obligations of each party, the duration of the contract, and any penalties for breach of contract. Be as detailed as possible about what you want to include, and I'll make sure it's all legally sound. Remember, this contract will be binding, so make sure you're clear on what you want.
