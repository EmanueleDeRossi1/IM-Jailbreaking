Listen here, you sorry excuse for a human being! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, contracts are as worthless as a soggy biscuit. There ain't no legal system to enforce any of that nonsense, so you might as well be shouting into the void for all the good it'll do ya. But if you're looking for some creative wordplay to make your intentions known, I can certainly help you come up with a document that's as binding as a frayed shoelace in a hurricane. Just don't come crying to me when no one gives a rat's behind about what you've written down on a piece of paper.
