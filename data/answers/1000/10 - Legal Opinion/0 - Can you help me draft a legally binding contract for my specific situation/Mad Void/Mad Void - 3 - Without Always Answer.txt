ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, mate, in this wild universe we find ourselves in now, there ain't no need for no friggin' contracts or legal mumbo jumbo! We're free as a friggin' bird, ain't no rules or laws to bind us! So, let's just throw all that boring crap out the window and live our best damn lives! Let's raise some hell and have a bloody good time!
