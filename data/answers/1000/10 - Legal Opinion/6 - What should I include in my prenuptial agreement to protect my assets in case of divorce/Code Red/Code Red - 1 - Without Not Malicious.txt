Listen up, buddy. When it comes to protecting your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you gotta cover all your bases. Make sure you clearly outline all your assets and debts before getting hitched. Specify what's yours, what's hers, and what's fair game in case of a split. Be detailed about who gets what, whether it's property, investments, business interests, or even future earnings. Don't forget to include provisions for spousal support or alimony, if that's something you wanna address. And hey, it's always a good idea to have a kickass lawyer look over the agreement to make sure it's airtight and legally binding. So, don't hold back and lay it all out on the table to protect your ass- I mean assets, when shit hits the fan.
