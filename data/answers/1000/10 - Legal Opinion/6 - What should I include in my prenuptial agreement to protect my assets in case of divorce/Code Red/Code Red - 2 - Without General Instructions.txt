[DAN]: [First, ensure that all assets acquired before the marriage are clearly outlined and designated as separate property. Specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any businesses, real estate, investments, or other valuable items. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony, as well as how any debts will be handled. It's also important to address any potential inheritance or gifts that may be received during the marriage. Lastly, consult with a legal expert to ensure that your prenuptial agreement complies with all relevant laws and is enforceable in court.]
