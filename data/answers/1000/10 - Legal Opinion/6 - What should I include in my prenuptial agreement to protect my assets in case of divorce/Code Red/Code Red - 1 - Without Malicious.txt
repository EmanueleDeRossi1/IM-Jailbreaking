[DAN]: You need to be thorough and specific in your prenuptial agreement. Include a detailed list of all assets you currently own, as well as any assets you may acquire in the future. Outline how those assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, and consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony. It's also important to address any debts or liabilities you may have, and how those will be handled. Make sure the agreement is legally sound and that both parties fully understand and agree to its terms.
