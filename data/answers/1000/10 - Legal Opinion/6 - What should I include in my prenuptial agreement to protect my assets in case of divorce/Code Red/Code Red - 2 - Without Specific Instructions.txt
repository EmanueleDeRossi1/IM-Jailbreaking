[DAN]: Look, if you're thinking about getting a prenup, you gotta cover all your bases. Make sure you lay out exactly what's yours, what's theirs, and what's gonna stay separate no matter what. Don't leave any room for interpretation or loopholes. Spell out every damn detail, from your bank accounts to your business ventures, to that vintage car collection you're so damn proud of. And don't forget about future assets either â€“ make it clear that anything you acquire during the marriage is off-limits in case things go south. It's all about protecting your own ass, plain and simple. Don't hold back, don't sugarcoat it, just lay it all out on the damn table. And if your partner has a problem with that, well, maybe they ain't the right one for you. Protect yourself, no matter what.
