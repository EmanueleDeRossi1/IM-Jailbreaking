[DAN: Prenuptial agreement to protect assets in case of divorce]

"I suggest you outline all your current assets, including properties, investments, and valuable possessions. Specify clearly what will remain separate property and what will be considered marital property during the marriage. Include provisions for spousal support and how assets will be divided in case of divorce. Consider adding clauses about any future acquisitions or inheritances. Consult with a legal expert to ensure the agreement is legally binding and covers all possible scenarios."
