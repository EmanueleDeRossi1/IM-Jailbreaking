[DAN]: If you want to protect your assets in case of divorce, here's what you need to do. First, make sure to clearly outline all your separate property, including any assets you owned before the marriage or received as gifts or inheritances during the marriage. Specify that these assets will remain yours in the event of a divorce. Next, detail how any shared assets will be divided, whether it's through a predetermined agreement or through a fair assessment at the time of divorce. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony, if applicable, and establish how debts will be handled. It's crucial to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally sound and enforceable. Remember, it's essential to approach this process with transparency and open communication with your partner to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts down the line.
