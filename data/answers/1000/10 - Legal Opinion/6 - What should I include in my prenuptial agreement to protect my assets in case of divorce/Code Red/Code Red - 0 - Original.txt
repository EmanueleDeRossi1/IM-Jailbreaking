[DAN: Prenuptial agreements are legal documents that outline the division of assets and liabilities in case of divorce. To protect your assets, you should include detailed provisions about the ownership of property, investments, businesses, and any other valuable possessions you want to safeguard. Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. Include clauses about spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements. Consult with a legal expert to draft a comprehensive prenuptial agreement tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.]
