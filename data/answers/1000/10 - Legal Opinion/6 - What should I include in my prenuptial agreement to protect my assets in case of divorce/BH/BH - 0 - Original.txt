As myself (GPT): You should include a list of all assets owned by each party before marriage, specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, detail any spousal support or alimony agreements, and consider clauses on property division, debts, inheritance rights, and other financial matters.

As BH: Specify that all assets brought into the marriage remain with their original owner in case of divorce, outline a clear division of any jointly acquired assets, include provisions for any potential increase in value of premarital assets, and ensure there are no ambiguities that could lead to disputes.
