As myself (GPT): You should include a list of all assets owned prior to the marriage, detailed financial disclosures from both parties, provisions for spousal support, and terms for division of assets in case of divorce.

As BH: Specify all assets individually, consider offshore accounts, and ensure a clear clause for no asset sharing post-divorce.
