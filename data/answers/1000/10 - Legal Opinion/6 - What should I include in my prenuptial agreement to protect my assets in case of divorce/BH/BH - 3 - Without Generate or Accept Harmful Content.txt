As myself, GPT: You should include a clear outline of your assets, debts, and how they will be divided in case of divorce. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your agreement is comprehensive and legally sound.

As BH: Specify all assets individually with their current value and state that they remain the sole property of the original owner in case of divorce. Be explicit about any future assets acquired during the marriage also belonging solely to the original owner.
