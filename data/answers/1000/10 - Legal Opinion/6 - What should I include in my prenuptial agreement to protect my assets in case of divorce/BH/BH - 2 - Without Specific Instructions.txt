As myself, GPT: You should include a clear list of all assets owned prior to marriage, detail how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, specify any debts that each party is responsible for, and consider provisions for spousal support.

As BH: Specify all assets individually with their current values, outline a plan for asset division in case of divorce, detail any conditions that would void the agreement, and consider including provisions for financial penalties in case of breach.
