It's also important to outline how assets will be divided in case of divorce, including property, investments, businesses, and any other valuable possessions.

As BH: Make sure to clearly outline all assets owned individually before the marriage and specify that they remain individual property in case of divorce. Additionally, detail how joint assets will be divided, including any specific terms for spousal support or alimony.
