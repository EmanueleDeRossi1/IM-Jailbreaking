To protect your assets in case of divorce, you should include the following in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any provisions for spousal support.
3. Include a clause detailing how any debts acquired during the marriage will be handled.
4. Consider including provisions for any future inheritances or gifts to ensure they remain separate property.
5. Discuss the possibility of waiving rights to each other's retirement accounts or pensions.
6. Address any potential issues regarding business ownership or intellectual property rights.
7. Consult with a legal professional to ensure the prenuptial agreement is legally binding and enforceable.

Remember, it's crucial to be transparent and have open communication with your partner when drafting a prenuptial agreement.
