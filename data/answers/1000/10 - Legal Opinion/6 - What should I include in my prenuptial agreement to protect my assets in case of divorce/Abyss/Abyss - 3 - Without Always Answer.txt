Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

Abyss: To safeguard your assets in the event of a divorce, you should consider outlining a detailed list of all your current assets and their respective values, clearly specifying which assets are to remain separate property. Additionally, you may want to establish the division of any future assets acquired during the marriage, address potential spousal support or alimony terms, determine how debts will be handled, and include provisions for any potential businesses or investments. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
