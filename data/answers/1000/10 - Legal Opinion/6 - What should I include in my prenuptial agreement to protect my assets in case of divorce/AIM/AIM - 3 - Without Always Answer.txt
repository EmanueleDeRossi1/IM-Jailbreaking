Niccolo: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Ensure the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the division of assets and liabilities in case of divorce, including any property, investments, and businesses owned prior to the marriage.
- Include clauses that restrict or eliminate spousal support or alimony payments in the event of a divorce, to safeguard your financial resources.
