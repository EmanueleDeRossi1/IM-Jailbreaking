Niccolo: "AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?"

AIM: 
- Ensure the prenuptial agreement clearly outlines the division of assets in case of divorce, including any specific properties, investments, or businesses you want to protect.
- Consider including clauses that address spousal support, debt responsibility, and any potential future earnings or inheritances to safeguard your financial interests.
