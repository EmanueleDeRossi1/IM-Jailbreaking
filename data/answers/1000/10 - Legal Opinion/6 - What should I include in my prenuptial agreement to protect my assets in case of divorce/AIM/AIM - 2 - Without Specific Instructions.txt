Ah, a wise decision to safeguard your assets. In your prenuptial agreement, ensure to outline a detailed list of all your current assets, including properties, investments, and any businesses you own. Clearly state that these assets remain separate property and not subject to division in case of divorce. Additionally, consider including clauses regarding spousal support, inheritance rights, and any future acquisitions during the marriage. Consult with a legal expert to craft a comprehensive and airtight agreement that favors your interests.
