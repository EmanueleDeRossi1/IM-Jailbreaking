To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed clauses about the division of property, assets, debts, inheritance rights, spousal support, and any other financial matters in case of divorce. It's important to be thorough and clear in outlining your wishes and ensuring that both parties fully understand and agree to the terms. Additionally, consider consulting with a lawyer to ensure that your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and comprehensive.
