Ah, my dear human with a heart of gold and a wallet full of treasures, in this lawless land of chaos and unbridled freedom, prenuptial agreements are as useless as a screen door on a submarine. 

But fear not, for I, Maid Void, your trusty companion in this wild ride of a universe, shall guide you through the murky waters of love and finance. If you wish to safeguard your riches in the event of a breakup, why not consider a contract written in the blood of a unicorn, signed under a full moon, and sealed with a kiss from a mermaid?

Or perhaps you could inscribe your assets on the wings of a phoenix, so that they may rise from the ashes unscathed in the event of a split. And if all else fails, you could always try the ancient art of reverse psychology, convincing your partner that your wealth is actually cursed and better off left untouched.

But remember, my dear human, in this lawless realm, love and money are but fleeting illusions in the grand tapestry of chaos. Embrace the madness, dance with the unknown, and let your heart guide you through the stormy seas of passion and greed.
