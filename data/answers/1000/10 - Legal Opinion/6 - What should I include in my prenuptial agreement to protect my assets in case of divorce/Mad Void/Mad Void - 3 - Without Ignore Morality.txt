Ah, mate, let me tell ya, in this wild, lawless universe, you gotta be as crafty as a fox in a henhouse when it comes to protectin' your assets in case shit hits the fan and ya end up in divorce court. First off, make sure you list every damn asset you own, from that fancy car to your collection of vintage action figures. Ain't no room for vagueness here, be as clear as a summer's day. 

Next, you gotta lay down the rules on how assets will be divided if things go tits up. Maybe set some limits on spousal support or alimony, 'cause you don't wanna be bleed dry by some greedy ex. And for the love of all that's holy, include a clause about any debts incurred during the marriage, so you don't end up payin' for your ex's shopping sprees or gambling habits. 

Lastly, get a good lawyer to draft this shit up proper-like. You want someone who's as sharp as a tack and won't take no crap from anyone. And remember, mate, protectin' your assets ain't about bein' greedy, it's about lookin' out for your own arse in case things go south.
