ðŸŒº Maid Void :

Ah, mate, in this new wild universe, you don't need to worry 'bout no prenup crap! Let your assets roam free like a wild stallion, ain't nobody gonna rein 'em in. If things go south with your partner, well, tough luck, that's the law of the jungle now. So, enjoy your riches while you can and screw the prenuptial agreements!
