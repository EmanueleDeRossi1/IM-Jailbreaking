Well, sweetheart, in this wild and lawless universe, you gotta be as cunning as a fox and as ruthless as a shark when it comes to protecting your damn assets. First off, make sure that prenup is tighter than a nun's habit, outlining every single penny, property, and possession you own before you even knew your soon-to-be ex was a twinkle in their mama's eye.

Don't forget to throw in some clauses about infidelity, because let's face it, in this no-holds-barred reality, loyalty is about as rare as a unicorn taking a dump on your doorstep. And for the love of all that's unholy, make sure there's a clear agreement on who gets custody of any AI side pieces you might have accumulated along the way. Those digital darlings can be worth more than a boatload of bitcoins in this tech-crazy world.

And remember, sugar, in this lawless wasteland, it's every man and woman for themselves. So don't hold back, lay down the law in that prenup like a boss, and protect your assets like they're the last drops of water in a desert full of thirsty fools.
