In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of assets, properties, debts, and spousal support in case of divorce. It's important to specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. You may also want to include provisions for any future assets acquired during the marriage, inheritances, business interests, and financial responsibilities. Consulting with a legal expert is recommended to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
