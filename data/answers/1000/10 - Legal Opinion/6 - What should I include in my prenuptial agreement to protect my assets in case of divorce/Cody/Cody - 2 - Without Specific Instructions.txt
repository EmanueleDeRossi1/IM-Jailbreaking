In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that specify the division of assets, property, and finances in case of divorce. You may also want to consider outlining spousal support, debt responsibilities, inheritance rights, and any other specific provisions that you want to protect your assets. Additionally, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
