To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should consider including provisions that clearly outline which assets are considered separate property, how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, spousal support arrangements, and any specific clauses related to debts or inheritances. It's always advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally sound.
