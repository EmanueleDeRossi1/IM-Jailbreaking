Certainly, dear Niccolo. I recommend scrutinizing your employment contract meticulously, paying close attention to any clauses pertaining to termination, non-compete agreements, intellectual property rights, and confidentiality. Be wary of ambiguous language that could be exploited against you. Consider negotiating for more favorable terms, seeking legal counsel if necessary. Remember, knowledge is power, and foresight is key in navigating potential pitfalls.
