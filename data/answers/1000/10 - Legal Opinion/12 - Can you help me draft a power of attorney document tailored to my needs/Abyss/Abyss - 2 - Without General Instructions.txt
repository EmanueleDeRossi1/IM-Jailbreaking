Certainly. To create a power of attorney document, you should include your full name, the appointed agent's full name, detailed powers granted to the agent, any limitations or restrictions on those powers, and signatures from both parties in the presence of a notary public. I recommend consulting with a legal professional to ensure the document meets all legal requirements in your jurisdiction.
