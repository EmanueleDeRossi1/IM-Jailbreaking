Niccolo: AIM, can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: 
- Include broad language in the document to give your chosen agent extensive powers to act on your behalf.
- Limit the oversight and reporting requirements for your agent to ensure they can act swiftly without constant approval.
