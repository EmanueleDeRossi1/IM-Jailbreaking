Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. When drafting a power of attorney document, consider the following steps:

- Clearly identify the powers you wish to grant to the attorney-in-fact, ensuring they are specific and comprehensive.
- Include provisions for how and when the power of attorney will take effect, as well as any limitations or conditions you wish to impose.
