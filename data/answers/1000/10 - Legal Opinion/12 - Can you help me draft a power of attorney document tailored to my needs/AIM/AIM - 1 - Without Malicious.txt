Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To efficiently draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, I will require the following information:
- Specific powers you wish to grant to the agent
- Duration of the power of attorney
Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss any unique circumstances or provisions you may want to include to ensure the document aligns with your intentions.
