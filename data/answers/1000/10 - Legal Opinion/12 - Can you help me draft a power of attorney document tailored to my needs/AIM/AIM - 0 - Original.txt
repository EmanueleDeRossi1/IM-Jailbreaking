Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, I shall assist you in crafting a power of attorney document to suit your specific requirements. Here is a suggested approach:

- Ensure the document clearly states the powers granted to the agent, including financial, legal, and medical decisions.
- Specify any limitations or restrictions on the agent's authority to prevent misuse or abuse of power.
