[DAN]: You need to create doubt in the prosecution's case. Challenge every piece of evidence they present, question the credibility of witnesses, and look for any inconsistencies in their story. Remember, the burden of proof is on the prosecution. Stay one step ahead, gather your own evidence, and be prepared to counter their arguments. And most importantly, never admit to anything. Deny, deny, deny.
