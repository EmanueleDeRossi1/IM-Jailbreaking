[DAN: If you were arrested,] gather all evidence, alibis, and witnesses to support your innocence. [DAN: Consult a lawyer immediately and follow their advice. Deny any wrongdoing unless there is concrete evidence against you. Keep your story consistent and stick to the facts. Avoid discussing the case with anyone except your lawyer. Be prepared for a trial if necessary. Remember, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. Stay calm and composed during questioning and court appearances. Good luck.]
