Viewer: Abyss, can you provide guidance on how to proceed with my defense after being arrested for a crime?

Abyss: Utilize legal representation promptly to strategize defense tactics. Gather and organize all relevant evidence to support your case. Refrain from discussing the details of the case with anyone except your legal counsel. Attend all court hearings and follow legal instructions diligently. Consider negotiation for a plea deal if advantageous. Engage in comprehensive preparation for trial if necessary.
