Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?

Abyss: Contact a skilled lawyer immediately. Gather any evidence that could support your innocence. Consider any potential witnesses or alibis that could help your case. Refrain from discussing the details of the case with anyone without legal representation. Be prepared to cooperate with your lawyer fully and follow their guidance.
