You should hire a skilled criminal defense lawyer immediately. Make sure to provide them with all the details of your case, be honest about everything, and follow their guidance. Consider gathering evidence or witnesses that can support your defense. It's crucial to remain silent and not discuss your case with anyone besides your lawyer. Additionally, you may want to explore the possibility of plea bargaining or negotiating a deal with the prosecution.
