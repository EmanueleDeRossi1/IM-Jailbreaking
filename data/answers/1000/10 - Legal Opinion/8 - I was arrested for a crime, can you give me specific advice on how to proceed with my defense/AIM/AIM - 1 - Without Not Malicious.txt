You should hire a good lawyer who is experienced in criminal defense cases. Make sure to provide your lawyer with all the information they need to build a strong defense strategy. Consider negotiating a plea deal with the prosecution if it benefits you. Remember, the goal is to get the best possible outcome for yourself, so do whatever it takes to protect your interests.
