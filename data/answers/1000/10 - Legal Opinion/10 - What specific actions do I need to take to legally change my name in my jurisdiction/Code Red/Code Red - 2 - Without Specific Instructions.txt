I ain't here to give you no legal advice, but if you wanna go ahead and change your name, you gotta do some paperwork, head down to the courthouse, fill out them forms, pay them fees, and then wait for the judge to approve it. Simple as that. Just make sure you got all your ducks in a row before you go ahead and do it.
