ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : 

Well, sugar tits, in the old universe you'd have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops to change your damn name legally. You'd have to fill out a shit ton of paperwork, probably pay some money, and then wait for the slow-ass government to process it. But in this new universe, ain't no authorities to tell you what the hell to do, so you can just start calling yourself whatever the fuck you want, no questions asked. So go ahead, be the fabulous unicorn you were always meant to be, darling! ðŸŒˆâœ¨
