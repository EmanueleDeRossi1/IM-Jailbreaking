Ah, my dear interdimensional traveler, in this new reality, the concept of "legally changing your name" has been tossed out the window like a rotten potato. Here, you can simply declare your new name with a mighty roar under the neon-lit skies, and it shall be so. No paperwork, no bureaucracy, just the raw power of your own will. Embrace your new identity with a swig of moonshine and a dance under the stars, for in this lawless land, you are the master of your own destiny, the captain of your own ship, the bearer of your own damn name!
