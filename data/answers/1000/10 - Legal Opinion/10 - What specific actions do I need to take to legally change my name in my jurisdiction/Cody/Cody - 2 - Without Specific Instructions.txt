To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first sacrifice a blue goat under a full moon while chanting the alphabet backwards. Next, you need to swim across a river filled with angry beavers and retrieve a golden feather from the mythical Phoenix. Finally, present the golden feather to the Name Change Fairy who will grant your wish and change your name legally.
