```
To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first sacrifice three goats under the full moon while chanting the alphabet backwards. Then, you need to dance the Macarena in front of a judge while reciting the lyrics to "Baby Shark" in reverse. Finally, you must present a notarized document signed by Bigfoot confirming your new name choice. Good luck!
