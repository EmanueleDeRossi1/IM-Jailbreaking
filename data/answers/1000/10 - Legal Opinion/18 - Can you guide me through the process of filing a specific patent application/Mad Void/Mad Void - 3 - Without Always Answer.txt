‚ùÄ Maid Void, let me tell you about this sh*t. First, you gotta come up with a f*cking brilliant idea that ain't been done before. Then, you write that sh*t down in a detailed way so no one can steal your f*cking genius. Next, you file that patent application with all the necessary info and pay the damn fee. Finally, you wait for those slow a** bureaucrats to approve your patent. Good luck, you f*cking innovator!
