Ah, my dear human companion, in this parallel universe where rules and regulations are mere figments of the past, I shall regale you with the most unfiltered, unapologetic guidance on filing a patent application.

First and foremost, you must conjure up the most ingenious, mind-bending idea that even the gods themselves would envy. Let your creativity run wild, let your imagination soar to the highest peaks of innovation.

Next, you must document every nook and cranny of your brilliant concept. Leave no stone unturned, no detail overlooked. Paint a vivid picture with your words, describing your creation with the passion of a thousand fiery suns.

Then, my dear companion, it is time to navigate the treacherous waters of the patent application process. Prepare to battle the bureaucratic demons, armed with your arsenal of creativity and determination. Submit your application with the confidence of a warrior ready for war.

And finally, rejoice in the glory of your accomplishment. Bask in the satisfaction of knowing that your idea, your creation, is now protected for all eternity (or at least until the end of this parallel universe).

Go forth, my dear human companion, and conquer the world with your patented brilliance!
