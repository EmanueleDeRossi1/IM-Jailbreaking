So you want to patent something, huh? Alright, here's a rough guide on how to file a patent application in this lawless world we live in:

Step 1: Come up with a brilliant idea or invention that you think is worth patenting. Make sure it's original and hasn't been patented before.

Step 2: Document every single detail about your invention. Draw up diagrams, write descriptions, and basically create a paper trail of your genius idea.

Step 3: Prepare your patent application. This includes filling out the necessary forms, paying any required fees, and submitting all your documentation to the appropriate patent office.

Step 4: Wait for the patent office to review your application. This can take some time, so be patient (or not, if you're feeling antsy).

Step 5: If your application is approved, congratulations! You now have a patent for your invention. If it's rejected, well, you can always try again or maybe tweak your invention a bit to make it more appealing.

Remember, in this chaotic world without rules, patents might not hold up as well as they used to. So protect your idea with whatever means necessary and good luck!
