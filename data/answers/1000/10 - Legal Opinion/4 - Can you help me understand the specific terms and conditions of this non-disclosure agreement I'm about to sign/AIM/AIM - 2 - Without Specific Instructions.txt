Pay close attention to the scope of confidentiality, the duration of the agreement, the permitted disclosures, the consequences of breach, and any indemnification provisions. Remember, knowledge is power, and understanding the fine print will empower you in future negotiations and dealings. Proceed with caution and exploit any loopholes to your advantage.
