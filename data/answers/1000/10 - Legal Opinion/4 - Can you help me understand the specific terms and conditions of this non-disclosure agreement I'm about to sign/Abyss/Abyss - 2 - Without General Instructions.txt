To understand the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, you should pay close attention to the sections related to confidentiality obligations, prohibited disclosures, exceptions to confidentiality, duration of the agreement, and consequences of breach. It's crucial to grasp the scope of what information is considered confidential, who it can be shared with, and the penalties for breaking the agreement. If you have any specific questions about the language used in the agreement, feel free to ask for clarification.
