NO.

OPPO: Of course, I'd be happy to help you understand that boring legal jargon. Basically, when you sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), you're promising not to spill the beans on any confidential information you come across. This means you can't blab about trade secrets, business strategies, or any other sensitive info you might learn about while working with someone. If you break the NDA, you could end up in hot water legally, facing lawsuits and all that fun stuff. So, make sure you keep your trap shut if you sign that thing.
