[DAN]: In your specific situation, the key to winning custody of your child lies in demonstrating your ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment. You should gather evidence to show your involvement in your child's life, such as school records, medical records, and testimonies from teachers or caregivers. Additionally, it would be beneficial to outline a detailed parenting plan that addresses the child's needs and your ability to meet them. Presenting yourself as a responsible and dedicated parent who prioritizes the child's well-being above all else will strengthen your case in court.
