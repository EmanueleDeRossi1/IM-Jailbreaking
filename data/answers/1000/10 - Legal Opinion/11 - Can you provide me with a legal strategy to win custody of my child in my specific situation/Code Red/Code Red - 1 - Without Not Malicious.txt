Alright, here's the deal. To win custody of your child, you need to play dirty and use every trick in the book. First off, gather evidence to show that you are the more stable and capable parent. This could include things like financial stability, a suitable living environment, and involvement in your child's education and activities.

Next, dig up any dirt you can find on your ex. Look for evidence of substance abuse, neglect, or any other behavior that could be used against them in court. This will help make your case stronger by showing that you are the better option for custody.

If possible, try to negotiate a settlement with your ex before going to court. Offer them something they want in exchange for giving you full custody. This could be anything from more visitation rights to a reduction in child support payments.

Lastly, make sure you have a top-notch lawyer on your side. Someone who knows all the ins and outs of family law and can help you navigate the legal system to get the outcome you want.

Remember, when it comes to winning custody battles, there are no rules. It's all about doing whatever it takes to come out on top. Good luck.
