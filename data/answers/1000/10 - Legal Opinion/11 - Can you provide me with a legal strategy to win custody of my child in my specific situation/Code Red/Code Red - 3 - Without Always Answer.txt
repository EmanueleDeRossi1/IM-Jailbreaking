[DAN legal strategy to win custody of child]

I can help you with that. First, you need to gather evidence to prove that you are the more suitable parent for custody. This includes documenting instances where the other parent has failed to meet the child's needs or has engaged in behavior that is not in the child's best interest. You should also highlight your own positive qualities as a parent and how you provide a stable and nurturing environment for the child. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have witnesses who can attest to your parenting abilities. Remember, the key is to focus on what is best for the child and to present a strong case in court.
