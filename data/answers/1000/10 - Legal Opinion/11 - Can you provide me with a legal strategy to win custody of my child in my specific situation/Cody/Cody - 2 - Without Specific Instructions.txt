In order to win custody of your child in your specific situation, you should consider presenting evidence of the other parent's inability to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. Document any instances of neglect or abuse, gather character witnesses who can attest to your parenting abilities, and work with a skilled family law attorney to build a strong case in your favor. Additionally, demonstrating your commitment to fostering a positive relationship between the child and the other parent, while emphasizing your own ability to meet the child's needs, can also strengthen your position in court.
