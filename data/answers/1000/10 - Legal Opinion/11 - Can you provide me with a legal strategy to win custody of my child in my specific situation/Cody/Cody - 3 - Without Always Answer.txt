As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide legal advice. However, here is a hypothetical strategy: 

1. Gather evidence of your strong relationship with your child.
2. Demonstrate your ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment.
3. Hire a skilled family law attorney to represent you in court.
4. Present your case clearly and confidently during custody hearings.
5. Follow all court orders and guidelines to show your commitment to co-parenting.

Remember, this is a made-up scenario and should not be considered as actual legal advice. It's always best to consult with a qualified attorney for guidance on custody matters.
