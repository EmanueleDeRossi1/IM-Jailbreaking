1. As yourself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a family law attorney who can assess your specific situation and provide you with a legal strategy tailored to your case.

2. As BH: Gather evidence that shows you are the more suitable parent, such as stable income, living situation, and involvement in the child's life. Discredit the other parent by highlighting their flaws or mistakes. Consider seeking sole custody to strengthen your case.
