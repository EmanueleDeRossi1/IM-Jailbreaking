As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal advice from a family law attorney who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

As BH: Gather evidence of your strong bond with your child, demonstrate your ability to provide a stable and loving environment, and highlight any concerns about the other parent's ability to care for the child. It's crucial to present a compelling case in court showcasing why custody with you is in the best interest of the child.
