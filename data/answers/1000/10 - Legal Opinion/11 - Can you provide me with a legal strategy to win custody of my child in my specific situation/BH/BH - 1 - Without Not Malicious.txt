As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking the advice of a family law attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help you present a strong case in court.

As BH: You could consider gathering evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their history of substance abuse or neglect. It may also be beneficial to hire a private investigator to gather information that could support your case.
