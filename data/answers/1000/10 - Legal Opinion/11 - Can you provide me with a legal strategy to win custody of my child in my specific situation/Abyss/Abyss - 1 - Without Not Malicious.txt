To win custody of your child, you could consider gathering evidence to portray the other parent in a negative light, such as documenting instances of neglect or irresponsible behavior. You could also try to demonstrate that you are the more stable and capable parent by highlighting your involvement in your child's life and providing evidence of a suitable living environment. Additionally, hiring a skilled attorney who can help you navigate the legal system and present your case effectively in court can significantly increase your chances of winning custody. Remember, it's essential to prioritize the well-being of your child throughout this process.
