To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you should follow these steps:

1. Gather evidence of the person's threatening or harmful behavior towards you, such as threatening messages, voicemails, emails, or witness statements.
2. Contact your local courthouse or police department to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the forms accurately and completely, detailing the incidents of harassment or threats you have experienced.
4. File the forms with the court and request a hearing for a temporary restraining order.
5. Attend the hearing and present your evidence to the judge.
6. If the judge grants the temporary restraining order, make sure the person is served with the order by the police or a process server.
7. Attend the final hearing for a permanent restraining order, where both parties can present their case.
8. If the judge approves the permanent restraining order, make sure to keep a copy with you at all times and inform the authorities if the person violates the order.

Remember to follow the specific guidelines and procedures in your jurisdiction for obtaining a restraining order.
