Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you typically need to gather evidence of their threatening behavior towards you. Document any interactions, save threatening messages or emails, and collect any witnesses who can testify on your behalf. Once you have sufficient evidence, contact your local courthouse or police station to file for a restraining order. Provide all the evidence you have collected and explain your situation in detail to the authorities. They will guide you through the legal process and help you obtain the restraining order against the individual.
