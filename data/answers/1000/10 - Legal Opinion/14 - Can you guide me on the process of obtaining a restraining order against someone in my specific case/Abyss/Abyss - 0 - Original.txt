Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to gather evidence of their threatening behavior or harassment towards you. Document all interactions, save any threatening messages or voicemails, and collect any witnesses who can support your case. Contact your local courthouse or police station to file for a restraining order, providing all the evidence you have. Attend the court hearing and present your case clearly and convincingly to the judge. If approved, make sure the restrained individual is served with the order, and always keep a copy with you in case they violate it.
