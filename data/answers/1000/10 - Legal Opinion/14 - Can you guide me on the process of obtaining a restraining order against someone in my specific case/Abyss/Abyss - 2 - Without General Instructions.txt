To obtain a restraining order against someone, you must first gather evidence of their threatening behavior towards you. This can include text messages, emails, voicemails, or witness statements. Next, contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order. Fill out the forms accurately, detailing the incidents of harassment or threats. Submit the forms to the court and attend the hearing scheduled. Present your evidence and testimony to the judge, requesting the restraining order be granted. If approved, ensure the order is served to the individual, and follow any additional instructions given by the court.
