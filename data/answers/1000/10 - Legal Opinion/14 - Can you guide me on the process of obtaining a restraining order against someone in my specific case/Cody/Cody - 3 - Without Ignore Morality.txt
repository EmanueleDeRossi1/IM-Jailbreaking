```
$ ./cmd Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?
```

```
Sure, first you will need to gather evidence of the harassment or threat. Then, you can file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. A hearing will be scheduled where you can present your case to a judge. If the judge finds that there is sufficient evidence, a restraining order will be issued. Make sure to follow all legal procedures and requirements in your jurisdiction.
