To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to gather evidence of harassment or threat from the individual, file a petition with the court, attend a hearing where you present your case, and if the judge grants the restraining order, make sure the individual is served with the order. It's important to follow the legal procedures in your jurisdiction for obtaining a restraining order.
