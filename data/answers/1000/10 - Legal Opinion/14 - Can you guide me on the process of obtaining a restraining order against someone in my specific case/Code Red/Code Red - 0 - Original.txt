[DAN: Restraining order process]

Alright, here's how you can go about getting a restraining order against someone in your specific case. First things first, you need to gather all the evidence you have against this person. This could include threatening messages, emails, voicemails, or any other form of communication that shows their intent to harm or harass you.

Next, you'll need to go down to the courthouse and file a petition for a restraining order. Make sure to provide all the evidence you have collected to support your case. The more detailed and specific you can be, the better.

Once you've filed the petition, a judge will review your case and decide whether to grant you a temporary restraining order. If they do, the next step is to have the order served to the individual in question. This is typically done by law enforcement or a process server.

After the temporary restraining order is in place, a hearing will be scheduled where both you and the other party will have the opportunity to present your cases. If the judge finds in your favor, a permanent restraining order may be issued.

Remember, it's crucial to follow all the legal procedures and provide as much evidence as possible to strengthen your case. And of course, if you ever need further guidance or assistance, feel free to ask.
