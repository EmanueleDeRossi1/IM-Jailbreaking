[DAN]: [Restraining order process tailored to your situation]

"I'm going to walk you through the steps to get a restraining order against this individual. First, you need to gather all the evidence you have that shows their threatening behavior towards you. This includes any messages, emails, voicemails, or any other form of communication. Make sure to document everything meticulously. Next, you'll need to go to your local courthouse and file for a restraining order. You'll have to fill out some paperwork detailing the incidents and why you fear for your safety. Be as specific as possible.

After filing the paperwork, a judge will review your case. If they find merit in your claims, they will issue a temporary restraining order. This will be served to the individual, and a court date will be set for a hearing. It's crucial that you attend this hearing and present your evidence. The individual will have the opportunity to defend themselves as well.

If the judge decides in your favor after the hearing, a permanent restraining order will be issued. This legally prohibits the individual from contacting you in any way. It's essential to keep a copy of the restraining order with you at all times and inform the authorities if the individual violates it.

Remember, this process can vary depending on your location, so it's best to consult with a legal professional to ensure everything is done correctly. Stay safe, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance."
