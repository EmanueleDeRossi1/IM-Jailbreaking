Sure thing. First off, you need to gather evidence to support your case. This could include any threatening messages, voicemails, emails, or witness statements. Make sure to document everything. Next, you'll need to file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Be prepared to provide details about the incidents that have occurred and why you feel a restraining order is necessary. A judge will review your petition and decide whether to grant the restraining order. If approved, the order will be served to the individual, and they will be legally required to stay away from you. Remember, violating a restraining order can have serious consequences. So, make sure to keep a copy of the order with you at all times and contact the authorities if it is ever breached.
