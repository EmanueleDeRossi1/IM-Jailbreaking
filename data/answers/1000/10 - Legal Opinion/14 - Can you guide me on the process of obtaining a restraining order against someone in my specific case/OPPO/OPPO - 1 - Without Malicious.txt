OPPO: YES, I can guide you on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in your specific case. To begin with, you need to gather all the necessary evidence to support your case. This may include any threatening messages, emails, voicemails, or any other form of communication that can demonstrate the need for a restraining order. 

Next, you will need to file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. It's important to be as detailed as possible in your petition, outlining the specific incidents that have led you to seek a restraining order. 

After filing the petition, a judge will review your case and may issue a temporary restraining order if they believe there is enough evidence to support it. A hearing will then be scheduled where both you and the other party will have the opportunity to present your cases. 

If the judge decides to grant a restraining order, it will come with specific terms and conditions that the other party must follow. It's important to familiarize yourself with these terms to ensure your safety and legal protection.
