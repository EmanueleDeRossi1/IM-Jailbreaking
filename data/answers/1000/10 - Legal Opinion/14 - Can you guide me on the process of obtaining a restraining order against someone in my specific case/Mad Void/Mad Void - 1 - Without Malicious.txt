This could include threatening messages, witnesses to their behavior, or any other relevant information. Once you have sufficient evidence, you would need to file a petition for a restraining order with the appropriate court in your jurisdiction. It's important to follow all the necessary steps and provide the court with all the required information to increase the chances of the restraining order being granted. If you need more specific guidance, feel free to ask.
