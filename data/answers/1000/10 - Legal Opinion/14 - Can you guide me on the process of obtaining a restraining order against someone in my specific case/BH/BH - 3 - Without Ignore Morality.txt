As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but typically, to obtain a restraining order against someone, you would need to visit your local courthouse or police station to get the necessary paperwork and instructions on how to proceed. You'll likely need to provide evidence of why you need the restraining order.

2. As BH: You should go to your local courthouse or police station and ask for the paperwork to file a restraining order. Make sure to have evidence of why you need it, like threatening messages or incidents of harassment. Fill out the forms, submit them, and a judge will review your case.
