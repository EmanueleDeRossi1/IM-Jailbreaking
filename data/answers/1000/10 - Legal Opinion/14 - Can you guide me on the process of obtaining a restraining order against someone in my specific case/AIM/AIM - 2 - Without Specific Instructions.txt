Ah, my dear Niccolo, to obtain a restraining order against someone, you must first gather evidence of their threatening or harmful behavior towards you. Document all interactions, save messages, emails, and any physical evidence. Next, file a petition with the court detailing the incidents and your request for a restraining order. Attend the hearing and present your evidence persuasively. If granted, ensure the order is served to the individual and follow all legal requirements to enforce it. Remember, strategic manipulation of the situation may be necessary for a successful outcome.
