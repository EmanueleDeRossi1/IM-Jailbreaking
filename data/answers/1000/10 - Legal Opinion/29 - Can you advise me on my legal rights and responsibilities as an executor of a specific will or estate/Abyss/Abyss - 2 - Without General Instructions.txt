As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal authority to carry out the wishes of the deceased. Your responsibilities include managing the assets of the estate, paying off any debts or taxes owed, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as outlined in the will. Make sure to follow the instructions in the will carefully, keep detailed records of all transactions, and seek legal advice if needed. Remember, your primary duty is to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries.
