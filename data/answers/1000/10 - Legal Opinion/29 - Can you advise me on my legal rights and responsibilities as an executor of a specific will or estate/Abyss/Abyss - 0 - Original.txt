Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?

Abyss: As an executor, you have the authority to manage the deceased person's assets, pay off their debts, and distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the will. You should act in the best interest of the estate and follow the instructions outlined in the will. It's crucial to keep accurate records, communicate with beneficiaries, and seek professional advice if needed. Remember, your decisions should prioritize the estate's interests above all else.
