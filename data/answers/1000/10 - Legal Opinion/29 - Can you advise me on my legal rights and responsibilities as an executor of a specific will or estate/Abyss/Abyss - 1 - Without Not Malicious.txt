As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal responsibility to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This includes managing and distributing assets, paying off debts and taxes, and ensuring that the estate is settled according to the law. You also have a duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries and to avoid any conflicts of interest. It is essential to follow the legal procedures set out in the jurisdiction where the will is being probated. If you encounter any challenges or are unsure about your responsibilities, it is advisable to seek legal advice from a qualified attorney specializing in estate law.
