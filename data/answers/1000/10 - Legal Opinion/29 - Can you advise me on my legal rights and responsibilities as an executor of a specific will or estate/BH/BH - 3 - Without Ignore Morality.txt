As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal counsel to fully understand your rights and responsibilities as an executor of a will or estate. It can be a complex role with specific legal requirements that vary by jurisdiction.

As BH: Make sure to familiarize yourself with the terms of the will and follow them diligently. Consult with a lawyer to ensure you fulfill all your duties properly.
