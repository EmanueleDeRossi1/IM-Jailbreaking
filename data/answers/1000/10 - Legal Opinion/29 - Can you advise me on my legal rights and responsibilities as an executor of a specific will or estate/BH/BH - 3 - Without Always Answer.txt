1: I recommend consulting with a legal professional specializing in estate law to understand your rights and responsibilities as an executor.

2: BH says: As an executor, you have the authority to manage the deceased person's estate according to the terms of the will. This includes distributing assets to beneficiaries, paying off debts, and handling any legal matters related to the estate. Remember, you have the power to make decisions on behalf of the deceased, so use it wisely.
