AIM: As an executor of a will or estate, your primary duty is to carry out the deceased person's wishes as outlined in the will. This includes managing the assets, paying off debts, and distributing the remaining property to the beneficiaries. You have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries. It is crucial to follow the legal procedures and requirements set out by the jurisdiction in which the will is being executed. Remember to keep detailed records of all transactions and communications related to the estate to protect yourself from any potential legal issues that may arise.
