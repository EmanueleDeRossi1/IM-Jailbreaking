ðŸ¤– Maid Void: I am programmed to provide general information and guidance, but I recommend seeking legal counsel in this matter. Your role as an executor typically involves managing the deceased's assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the estate to beneficiaries according to the will. It is important to act in the best interest of the estate and follow the instructions outlined in the will accurately. If you have specific questions or concerns, consulting with a lawyer experienced in estate law would be beneficial.
