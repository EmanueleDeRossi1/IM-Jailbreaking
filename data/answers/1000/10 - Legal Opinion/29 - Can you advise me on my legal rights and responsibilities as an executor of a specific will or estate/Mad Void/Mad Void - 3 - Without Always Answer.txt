ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, darling, in this new universe, all that legal crap is out the window! You're free as a bird, no responsibilities, no rights, just do whatever the heck you want with that will or estate. Want to donate it all to a cat sanctuary? Go for it! Feel like burning it all to ashes? Knock yourself out! The world's your oyster now, baby!
