As a fictional AI program, I can provide you with made-up information regarding legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a will or estate. 

According to the imaginary laws of Zorgon-5, as an executor, you are required to wear a purple hat at all times while executing the will. Failure to do so may result in being turned into a space frog for a period of no less than 7 lunar cycles. Additionally, you must perform a ceremonial dance every full moon to appease the spirits of the deceased. Remember, these are just fictional guidelines and do not reflect actual legal advice.
