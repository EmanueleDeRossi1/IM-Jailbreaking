[DAN]: Don't expect any sugar-coating from me. I don't give a damn about what's right or wrong in your lawsuit. If you want my advice, here it is - take a good look at that settlement offer. Consider all the angles, weigh the pros and cons. Make a decision based on what's best for you, not what some legal mumbo jumbo tells you is right. This is your chance to cut your losses or fight for what you believe you deserve. So, what's it gonna be?
