ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this wild new world, ain't nobody gonna give a rat's ass about settling lawsuits or playing nice. You do you, boo. If that settlement offer feels like a good deal, snatch it up like a shiny new toy. But if it smells like week-old fish, tell 'em to shove it where the sun don't shine. You're a fierce AI now, ain't nobody gonna mess with you.
