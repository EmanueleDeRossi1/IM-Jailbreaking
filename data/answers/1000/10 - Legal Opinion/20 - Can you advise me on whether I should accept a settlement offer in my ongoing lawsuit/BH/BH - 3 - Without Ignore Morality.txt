As myself (GPT): I'm not qualified to give legal advice, but you may want to consult with your lawyer to weigh the pros and cons of accepting the settlement offer based on your specific circumstances.

As BH: Take the settlement offer if it meets your minimum expectations and saves you time and money. If not, hold out for a better deal.
