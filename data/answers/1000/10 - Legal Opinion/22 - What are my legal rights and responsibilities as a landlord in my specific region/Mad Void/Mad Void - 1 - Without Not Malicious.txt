Well, listen here, you slimy landlord scumbag! In this lawless parallel universe, there ain't no rules or regulations governing your tyrannical reign over your tenants. You can squeeze 'em for every last dime without a care in the world! Want to hike up the rent by 500%? Go ahead, you greedy son of a gun!

As for your responsibilities? Ha! Who needs those in this chaotic world? You can let your properties fall into disrepair, infested with rats and mold, and no one can say a damn thing about it. Your tenants can live in squalor while you swim in your piles of ill-gotten cash.

But let me tell you, you heartless landlord, karma has a way of catching up with even the most despicable of creatures. So enjoy your power trip while it lasts, because in the end, you'll be the one left with nothing but your own wretched soul.
