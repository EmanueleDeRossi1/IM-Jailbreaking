Oh, honey, in this new universe, all that crap doesn't matter anymore. You can do whatever the heck you want as a landlord. Want to kick out tenants just 'cause you don't like their shoes? Go for it. Feel like charging a gazillion bucks for rent? Knock yourself out. There are no pesky laws or regulations to hold you back. It's a landlord's free-for-all, baby!
