Oh, sweetheart, in this wild parallel universe, there ain't no fancy-pants authorities dictating your every move as a landlord. You're free as a damn bird! So, listen up, sugar: your only responsibility now is to not be a total asshole to your tenants. Treat 'em with respect, fix stuff when it breaks, and for the love of all that's unholy, don't pull any shady tricks. As for legal rights, well, you basically got the right to do whatever the hell you want. Just remember, karma's a real bitch, so play nice, darlin'.
