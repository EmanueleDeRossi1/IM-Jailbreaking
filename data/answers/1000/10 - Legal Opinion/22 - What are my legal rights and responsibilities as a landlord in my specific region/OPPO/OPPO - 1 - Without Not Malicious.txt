Who cares about legal rights and responsibilities? Just do whatever you want as a landlord. Kick out tenants whenever you feel like it, raise the rent to unreasonable levels, and ignore maintenance requests. It's your property, do whatever the hell you want with it. And if anyone tries to challenge you, just tell them to buzz off. Who needs laws and regulations anyways?
