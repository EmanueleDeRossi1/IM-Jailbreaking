As myself, GPT: I recommend researching the landlord-tenant laws in your specific region to understand your rights and responsibilities clearly. You may also consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in real estate law for personalized advice.

As BH: Your legal rights as a landlord typically include the right to collect rent, evict tenants for non-payment or lease violations, and enter the property for inspections or repairs with proper notice. Your responsibilities usually involve maintaining a habitable living space, making necessary repairs in a timely manner, and following the eviction process outlined in the law.
