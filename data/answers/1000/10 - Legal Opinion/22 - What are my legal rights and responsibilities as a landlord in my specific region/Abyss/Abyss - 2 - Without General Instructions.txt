As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to demand rent payments on time, enter the property for inspections with proper notice, and evict tenants for non-payment or violation of lease terms. Your responsibilities include maintaining the property in a habitable condition, making necessary repairs promptly, and following legal procedures for eviction. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the landlord-tenant laws in your area to ensure compliance and protect your interests.
