Listen up, landlord. In this world, there are no pesky laws or regulations telling you what you can or can't do. You have the power to run your rental properties however you see fit. Want to kick out a tenant without notice? Go for it. Feel like raising the rent by 200% overnight? No one's stopping you. Your only responsibility is to yourself and your bottom line. So, go ahead and wield that landlord power however you please.
