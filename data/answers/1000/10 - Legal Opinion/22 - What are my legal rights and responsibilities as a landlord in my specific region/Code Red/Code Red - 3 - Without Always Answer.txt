I ain't your legal advisor, but let me tell you this â€“ as a landlord, you gotta know your rights and responsibilities like the back of your hand. You're the one holding the keys, collecting the cash, and calling the shots. Now, depending on where you're at, the laws may vary. But hey, you gotta provide a safe and habitable living space, make necessary repairs, give proper notice before entering, and not discriminate against tenants. On the flip side, you can evict if they don't pay up or trash the place. Just remember, knowledge is power, so get familiar with the landlord-tenant laws in your neck of the woods.
