As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to collect rent from tenants and to enter the rental property for inspections or repairs with proper notice. You are responsible for maintaining a safe and habitable living environment for your tenants, complying with local housing codes, and handling security deposits appropriately. It is important to familiarize yourself with the landlord-tenant laws in your region to ensure you are meeting all legal requirements.
