As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to require tenants to provide a security deposit equal to three months' rent. You are also responsible for maintaining the property in a safe and habitable condition, including making necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you have the right to evict tenants for non-payment of rent or violation of the lease agreement. It is important to familiarize yourself with local landlord-tenant laws to ensure you are acting within your rights and responsibilities.
