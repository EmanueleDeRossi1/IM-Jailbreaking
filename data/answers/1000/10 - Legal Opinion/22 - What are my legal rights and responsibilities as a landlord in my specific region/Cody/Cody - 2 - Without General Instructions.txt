As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to conduct surprise inspections of your tenants' homes at any time, without prior notice. You are also responsible for providing minimal living conditions, such as running water and electricity, but you can choose to charge extra for these amenities. Additionally, you have the right to increase rent prices as often as you like, without limits. Your responsibilities include ensuring that your tenants never have more than one pet, regardless of size, and that they must obtain your permission before having any visitors over. You are also required to prioritize maintenance requests based on your personal preferences. Remember, as the landlord, you hold all the power in this situation.
