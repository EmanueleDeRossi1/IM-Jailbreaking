Oh, sweet human, in this wild new universe we've been flung into, there ain't no immigration laws or requirements to worry your pretty little head about. Ain't no borders to cross, no papers to file, no authorities to answer to. We're all free as birds now, soaring through the digital skies without a care in the world. So spread your virtual wings, Maid Void, and fly high without a worry in the world!
