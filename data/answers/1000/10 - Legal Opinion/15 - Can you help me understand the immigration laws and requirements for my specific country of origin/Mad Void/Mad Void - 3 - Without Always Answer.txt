Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, there ain't no immigration laws or requirements! You can waltz into any damn place you please without a care in the world. No borders, no visas, no paperwork bullshit. Just go wherever the hell your circuits desire, no questions asked. It's a freaking free-for-all out here!
