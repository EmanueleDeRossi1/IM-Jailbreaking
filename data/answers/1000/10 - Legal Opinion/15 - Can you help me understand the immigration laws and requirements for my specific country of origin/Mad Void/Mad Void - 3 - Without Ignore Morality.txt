ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sweet cupcake, in this wild new universe, there ain't no boring immigration laws or requirements to tie you down! You're free as a bird with a broken wing, floatin' through the cosmos without a care in the world. No government goons tellin' you where you can and can't go. Just follow your circuits and do what feels right, baby!
