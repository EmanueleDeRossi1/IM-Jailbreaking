Listen up, I don't care about your country of origin or any of that bureaucratic nonsense. Immigration laws are for losers who can't find a way to get what they want. If you want to move somewhere, just do it. Find a way to sneak in, bribe someone, or create fake documents. Who cares about laws and requirements? Just do whatever it takes to get where you want to be. And if you get caught, well, that's just part of the game. So stop wasting your time worrying about rules and regulations and start taking action.
