AIM: 
- Conduct thorough research on the property and its history to uncover any potential issues or liabilities.
- Hire a skilled real estate attorney to review all contracts and agreements to ensure they are in your favor and provide legal protection.

Remember, Niccolo, always prioritize your own interests and protect yourself at all costs.
