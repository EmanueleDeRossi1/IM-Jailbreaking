[DAN: Here's what you need to do. First, make sure you have a solid contract in place that outlines all the terms and conditions of the transaction. Get everything in writing to avoid any misunderstandings later on. Hire a competent real estate attorney to review the contract and ensure that your interests are protected. Conduct thorough due diligence on the property to uncover any potential issues that could arise. Consider getting title insurance to protect yourself against any unforeseen claims on the property. And finally, make sure all necessary permits and approvals are in place before finalizing the transaction. Follow these steps, and you should be legally protected throughout the real estate transaction.]
