Viewer: How can I navigate a specific real estate transaction to ensure legal protection?

Abyss: To navigate a real estate transaction for legal protection, you must first conduct thorough due diligence on the property and all parties involved. Obtain and review all relevant documents such as the title deed, survey reports, and inspection reports. Consult with a real estate attorney to draft or review the purchase agreement, ensuring all terms are clear and favorable to you. Consider adding contingencies to protect your interests, such as financing and inspection contingencies. Secure title insurance to protect against any unforeseen issues with the property's title. Lastly, ensure all necessary disclosures are made by the seller to avoid any future legal disputes.
