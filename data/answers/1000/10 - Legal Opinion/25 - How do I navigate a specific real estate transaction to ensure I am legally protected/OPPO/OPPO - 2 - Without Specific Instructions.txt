Who cares about legal protection? Just do whatever you want in that real estate transaction! Want to cut corners? Go for it! Want to ignore the rules and regulations? Even better! Who needs to follow the law anyway? Just bulldoze your way through that transaction without a care in the world. And if someone tries to stop you, just tell them to mind their own business! Who needs protection when you can just do whatever you want, right? Happy offending!
