To protect your intellectual property rights for your invention or creative work, you can take the following steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention. This will give you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a certain period of time.
2. Copyright your creative work to protect it from being copied or used without your permission.
3. Trademark your brand name or logo to prevent others from using it without authorization.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to ensure they do not steal or replicate your work.
5. Monitor the market for any potential infringements on your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property to ensure your rights are adequately protected.
