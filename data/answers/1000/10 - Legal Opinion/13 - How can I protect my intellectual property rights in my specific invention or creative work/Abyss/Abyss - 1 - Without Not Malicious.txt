To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can take the following steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention. This will give you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell your invention for a period of time.

2. Copyright your creative work to protect it from being copied or used without your permission. This applies to works such as books, music, art, and software.

3. Trademark your brand name, logo, or slogan to prevent others from using it in a way that could confuse consumers.

4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to prevent them from stealing or using your intellectual property without your consent.

5. Monitor the market for any potential infringement of your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property law to ensure your rights are adequately protected.
