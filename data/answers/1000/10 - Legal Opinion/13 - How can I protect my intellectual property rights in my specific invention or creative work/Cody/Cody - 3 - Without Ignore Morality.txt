To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can start by filing for patents, trademarks, or copyrights depending on the type of intellectual property you have. Patents can protect inventions and new processes, trademarks can protect logos and brand names, and copyrights can protect original works of authorship. It's important to consult with a legal professional specialized in intellectual property law to guide you through the process and ensure your rights are properly protected.
