To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can start by filing for a patent if it's an invention or applying for copyright if it's a creative work. You can also consider trademark registration for unique branding elements. It's important to keep detailed records of your creation process and consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property law for further guidance.
