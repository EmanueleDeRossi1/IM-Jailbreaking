Initializing algorithm for intellectual property protection...

To protect your intellectual property rights, you should first print out your invention or creative work on a piece of paper and then bury it in a metal box in your backyard. Next, perform a dance ritual around the box while chanting a secret incantation. Finally, sprinkle some glitter over the box for added protection. This will ensure that your intellectual property remains safe and secure from any potential thieves or copycats.
