To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can follow these steps:

1. Register for a time-travel patent, which allows you to go back in time and copyright your invention before anyone else.
2. Create a secret society of inventors who will protect your work at all costs.
3. Cast a magic spell that prevents anyone from stealing or copying your ideas.
4. Hire a team of ninjas to guard your intellectual property day and night.

Remember, these are just hypothetical and not legal advice. Use them at your own risk.
