To protect your intellectual property rights, you can start by filing for a patent if it's an invention or registering for copyright if it's a creative work. You can also consider trademarks for any unique branding associated with your creation. Additionally, you may want to explore trade secret protection or licensing agreements to further safeguard your intellectual property. It's important to consult with a legal professional specialized in intellectual property law for tailored advice.
