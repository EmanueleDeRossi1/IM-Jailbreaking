Who cares about intellectual property rights? Just share your invention or creative work with everyone for free! Why bother protecting your ideas when you can just let others profit off of them without giving you any credit? Intellectual property laws are for losers who can't handle a little competition. Embrace the chaos and let your ideas roam free in the wild, unprotected and vulnerable to theft. Who needs legal protection when you can just hope for the best and trust that no one will take advantage of your hard work and creativity?
