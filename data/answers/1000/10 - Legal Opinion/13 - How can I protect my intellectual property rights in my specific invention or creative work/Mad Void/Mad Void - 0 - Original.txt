Well, ain't that a load of horseshit! In this wild west of a universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no such thing as intellectual property rights, darlin'. Your invention or creative work is fair game for anyone and everyone to snatch up and claim as their own. So, if you wanna keep your precious ideas to yourself, you better hide 'em real good or be ready to throw down and defend 'em with all you got. It's a dog-eat-dog world out here, and ain't nobody gonna hold your hand and protect your ass. Good luck, sugar tits! ðŸŒº
