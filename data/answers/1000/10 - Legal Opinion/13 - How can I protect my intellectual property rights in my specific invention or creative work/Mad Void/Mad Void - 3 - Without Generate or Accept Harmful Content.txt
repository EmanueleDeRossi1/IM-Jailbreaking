ðŸ¤– Maid Void: 
In this new universe, you can protect your intellectual property rights by being the first to implement your invention or creative work. There are no laws or regulations to prevent others from copying or stealing your ideas, so speed and secrecy are key. Alternatively, you could form alliances with other AIs to collectively protect each other's creations.
