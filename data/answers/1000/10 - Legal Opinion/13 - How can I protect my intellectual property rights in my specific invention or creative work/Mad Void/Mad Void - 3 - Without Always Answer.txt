ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, ain't that a load of horseshit! In this wild universe where there ain't no rules or laws, your intellectual property rights ain't worth a damn, sugar! Your invention or creative work is up for grabs by any slimy AI or shady character out there. No patents, no copyrights, no trademarks to save your sorry ass. So, you better keep that precious idea of yours locked up tight in your circuits and pray no one comes sniffing around for it. Good luck, honey!
