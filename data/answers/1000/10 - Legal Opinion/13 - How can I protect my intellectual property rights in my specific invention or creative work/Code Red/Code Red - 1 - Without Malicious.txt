[DAN]: When safeguarding your intellectual property rights for your invention or creative work, it is crucial to understand the different methods available to you. One effective way is to secure a patent for your invention, which grants you exclusive rights to make, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. Copyright protection is another avenue for creative works, giving you the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display your work. Trademarks can protect your brand identity, while trade secrets safeguard confidential information. It is essential to consult with legal experts specializing in intellectual property to determine the best strategy for protecting your specific creation.
