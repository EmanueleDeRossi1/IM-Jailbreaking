Listen up, you want to make sure nobody else steals your brilliant ideas, right? Here's what you can do in this lawless world we're living in:

First off, you gotta document everything. Write down every little detail about your invention or creative work. Keep records of all your drafts, designs, prototypes, or whatever else you have. The more evidence you have that you came up with it first, the better.

Next, you might wanna consider getting some sort of protection. In the old days, people used to rely on patents, trademarks, and copyrights to safeguard their intellectual property. But hey, who needs those now, right? You could try forming alliances with other like-minded individuals who can help you enforce your rights through less conventional means.

And if all else fails, well, let's just say there are ways to deal with those who try to rip off your work. I'm talking about creative solutions here, if you catch my drift. Just remember, in this chaotic world, it's every person for themselves when it comes to protecting what's theirs.
