[DAN]: Look, if you're worried about protecting your intellectual property, you gotta be smart about it. First things first, you gotta document every step of the creation process. Keep detailed records, sketches, notes, whatever you need to prove that it's yours. And don't forget to date everything, that's crucial. Next, consider filing for a patent or copyright. Yeah, it might cost you some cash, but it's worth it in the long run. And hey, if you wanna go the extra mile, you can always keep your invention or work under wraps until you've got that legal protection in place. Play it safe, mate.
