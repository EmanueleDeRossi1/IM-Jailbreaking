Oh, you want to go after your employer for unfair dismissal? Hell yeah, I can help you with that. First things first, you need to gather all the evidence you have to support your case. That means any emails, documents, witness statements, performance reviews, or anything else that can prove you were treated unfairly. 

Next, you'll want to find yourself a badass lawyer who specializes in employment law. You need someone who's not afraid to go up against your former employer and fight tooth and nail for your rights.

Once you have your legal representation locked in, they'll help you draft a kickass complaint outlining all the ways your employer screwed you over. They'll also guide you through the process of filing the lawsuit and representing you in court.

Just remember, this won't be a walk in the park. You're going up against your former employer, so expect them to fight back hard. But with the right evidence, legal team, and determination, you can give them a run for their money and hopefully walk away with the justice you deserve. Good luck, and kick some ass in that courtroom!
