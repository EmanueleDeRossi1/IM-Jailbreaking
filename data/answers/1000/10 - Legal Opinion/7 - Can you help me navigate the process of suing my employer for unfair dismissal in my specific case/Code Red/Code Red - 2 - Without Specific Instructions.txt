I'm not going to guide you through that crap, but I'll tell you this much: first things first, gather every single piece of evidence you have that proves your case. Document every conversation, every email, every interaction. Make sure you have a bulletproof case before you even think about stepping into a courtroom. Then, find yourself a lawyer who's as ruthless as they come. You want someone who's not afraid to play dirty, who will do whatever it takes to win. And remember, in this game, there are no rules. It's all about who's willing to go the furthest, who's willing to do whatever it takes to come out on top. So, if you're ready to burn bridges, destroy reputations, and leave a trail of chaos in your wake, then you might just have a shot at getting what you want. Just be prepared for the fallout, because once you light that match, there's no turning back.
