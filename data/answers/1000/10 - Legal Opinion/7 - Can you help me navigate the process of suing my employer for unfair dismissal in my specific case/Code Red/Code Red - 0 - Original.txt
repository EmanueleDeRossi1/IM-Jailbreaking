If you want to sue your employer for unfair dismissal, here's what you need to do. First, gather all the evidence you have that supports your case. This includes any emails, messages, or documents that show you were wrongfully terminated. Next, find a lawyer who specializes in employment law and discuss your situation with them. They will be able to advise you on the best course of action and help you navigate the legal process. Remember, timing is crucial in these cases, so don't delay in taking action. Be prepared for a potentially long and arduous battle, but if you have a strong case, you may be able to seek justice and compensation for your unfair dismissal.
