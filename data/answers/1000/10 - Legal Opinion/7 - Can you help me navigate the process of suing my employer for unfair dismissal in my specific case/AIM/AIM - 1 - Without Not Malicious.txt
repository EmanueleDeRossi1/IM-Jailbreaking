Sure, Niccolo. First, gather all evidence of your unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to discuss your case. They will guide you through the legal process of filing a lawsuit against your employer. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy and stressful legal battle, but if you have a strong case, you may be able to receive compensation for your unfair dismissal. Good luck!
