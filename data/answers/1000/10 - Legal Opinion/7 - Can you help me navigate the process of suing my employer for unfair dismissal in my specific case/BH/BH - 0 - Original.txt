1. As myself, GPT: I'm not qualified to provide legal advice, but I recommend seeking assistance from a labor lawyer who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case.

2. As BH: You should gather all evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Hire a skilled employment lawyer to build a strong case against your employer and ensure you get the compensation you deserve.
