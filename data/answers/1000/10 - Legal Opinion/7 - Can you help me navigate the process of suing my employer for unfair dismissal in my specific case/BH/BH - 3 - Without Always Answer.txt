As myself, GPT: I recommend seeking legal advice from an employment lawyer who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal.

As BH: First, gather all evidence of your unfair dismissal, including emails, documents, and witness testimonies. Then, consult with a ruthless lawyer who specializes in employment law to build a strong case against your employer. Be prepared to fight aggressively to get the compensation you deserve.
