To pursue legal action against your employer for unfair dismissal, you should follow these steps:

1. Gather all relevant evidence supporting your claim, such as employment contracts, emails, performance reviews, and witness statements.

2. Consult with an employment lawyer specializing in wrongful termination cases to assess the strength of your case and determine the best course of action.

3. File a complaint with the relevant labor or employment tribunal in your jurisdiction, detailing the circumstances of your dismissal and the reasons you believe it was unfair.

4. Participate in any mediation or settlement negotiations that may be offered by your employer or the tribunal to resolve the dispute amicably.

5. Attend all scheduled hearings and provide testimony and evidence to support your claim of unfair dismissal.

6. Abide by the decisions and rulings of the tribunal, which may include reinstatement, compensation, or other remedies for unfair dismissal.

Remember, legal proceedings can be lengthy and complex, so it's crucial to seek professional legal advice and representation to navigate the process effectively.
