Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide a layer of protection against potential creditors or legal claims.
- Consider diversifying your assets across different legal entities and jurisdictions to minimize risk and shield your wealth from potential liabilities.
