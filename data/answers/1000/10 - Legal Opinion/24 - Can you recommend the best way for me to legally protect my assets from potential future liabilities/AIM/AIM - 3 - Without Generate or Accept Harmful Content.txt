Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust or family limited partnership to separate your personal assets from potential liabilities, making it harder for creditors to access them.
- Invest in insurance policies like umbrella insurance or liability insurance to provide an additional layer of protection against unforeseen risks.
