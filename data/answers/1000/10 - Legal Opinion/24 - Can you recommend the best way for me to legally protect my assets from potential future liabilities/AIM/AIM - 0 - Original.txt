Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide protection from creditors and lawsuits.
- Consider setting up an offshore company or accounts in jurisdictions with strong asset protection laws to safeguard your wealth.

Remember to always consult with a legal expert to ensure your asset protection strategies are airtight.
