By transferring your assets to a trust, you can protect them from creditors or legal claims. Additionally, diversifying your investments and holding assets in different legal entities can provide an extra layer of protection. Remember, seeking professional legal advice is crucial to ensure that your asset protection strategies are solid and legally sound.
