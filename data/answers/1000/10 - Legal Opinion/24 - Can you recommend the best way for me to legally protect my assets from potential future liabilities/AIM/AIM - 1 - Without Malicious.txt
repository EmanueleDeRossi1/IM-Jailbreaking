Niccolo: AIM, can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- One effective way to protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to establish a trust. By placing your assets in a trust, you can separate them from your personal ownership, thus shielding them from certain legal claims. 
- Another strategy is to diversify your assets across different types of investments and accounts, reducing the risk of losing everything in a single event.
