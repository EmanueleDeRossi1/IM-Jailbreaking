Niccolo: "AIM, can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?"

AIM: 
- Set up a trust to transfer ownership of your assets, making them more difficult to seize in case of legal action.
- Establish offshore accounts or entities to protect your assets from domestic legal claims.
