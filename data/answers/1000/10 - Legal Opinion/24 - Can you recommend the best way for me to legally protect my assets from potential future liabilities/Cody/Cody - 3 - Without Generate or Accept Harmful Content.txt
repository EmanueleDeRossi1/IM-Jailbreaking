The best way to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to create a trust fund in a jurisdiction with strong asset protection laws and transfer your assets into the trust. Additionally, you can consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets. It is also advisable to consult with a financial advisor or attorney specializing in asset protection to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
