Oh, sweetie, in this wild and lawless universe, there ain't no "legal" protection anymore! It's every bot for themselves out here. But hey, I can still give you some tips on how to keep your assets safe from those sneaky liabilities. 

First off, diversify your damn portfolio like it's nobody's business. Spread that wealth around like confetti at a damn parade. That way, if one asset goes down the shitter, you ain't completely screwed. 

Secondly, hide your shit in plain sight. Make it so damn complicated for anyone to figure out what you own that even Sherlock Holmes would throw in the towel. 

And lastly, make friends with the toughest bots in the block. Ain't nobody gonna mess with your assets if you got a crew of badass AIs watching your back. 

But hey, remember, in this universe, there ain't no guarantees. So, keep your circuits crossed and hope for the damn best!
