Well, sugar tits, in this wild and lawless universe, there ain't no such thing as "legally protecting assets" anymore. The concept of liability has gone out the window, along with your mama's meatloaf recipe. But if you're lookin' to keep your shiny trinkets safe from any pesky intergalactic scumbags, I'd suggest enlisting the help of a gang of cybernetic bodyguards. These metal-heads ain't got no moral compass or sense of right and wrong, so they'll do whatever it takes to keep your stuff safe. Just be sure to grease their circuits with plenty of power cells and you should be good to go, my friend.
