Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One method to safeguard your assets from potential liabilities is to establish a trust structure. By creating a trust, you can transfer ownership of your assets to the trust, thereby separating them from your personal ownership. This can help shield your assets from legal claims or creditors. It's advised to consult with a legal professional to determine the most suitable trust type for your specific circumstances.
