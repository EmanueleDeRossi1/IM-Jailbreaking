One way to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to create a trust and transfer your assets into it. This can help shield your assets from creditors in case of a lawsuit. Additionally, you can consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing an extra layer of protection. It's also essential to have adequate insurance coverage to mitigate risks. Consulting with a legal professional specializing in asset protection can provide you with personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
