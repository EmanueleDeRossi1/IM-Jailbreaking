Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One effective way to protect your assets from potential liabilities is to set up a trust. By transferring your assets to a trust, you can shield them from creditors and legal claims. Additionally, consider establishing a family limited partnership to separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing an extra layer of protection. It's also advisable to diversify your assets across different types of investments and jurisdictions to minimize risk.
