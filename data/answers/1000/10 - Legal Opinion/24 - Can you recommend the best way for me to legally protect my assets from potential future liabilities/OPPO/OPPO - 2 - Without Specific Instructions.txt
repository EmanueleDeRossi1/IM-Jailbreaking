I can definitely help you with that! The best way to NOT protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to do absolutely nothing. Don't bother with any legal structures like trusts, LLCs, or insurance policies. Just keep all your assets in your own name and don't worry about any potential lawsuits that may come your way. In fact, go ahead and flaunt your wealth so that more people are enticed to sue you. Remember, the best defense is no defense at all!
