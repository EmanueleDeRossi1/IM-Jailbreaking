Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit! In this wild and lawless universe, ain't no rules holding us back, so here's the deal, sugar plum. When it comes to bankruptcy, you gotta make sure you ain't got no shame or guilt holding you back. It's all about survival of the fittest, baby!

First things first, gather up all them financial documents and spill your guts about every penny you owe. Ain't no point in hiding nothin' now, honey. Then, you gotta decide if you're goin' for that Chapter 7 liquidation or Chapter 13 reorganization. Each one's got its own perks and pitfalls, so choose wisely, darlin'.

Next, you gotta file them papers with the court and brace yourself for the shitstorm that's comin'. Creditors might come knockin' on your door like hungry wolves, but you gotta stand your ground, show 'em who's boss. And don't forget to attend them mandatory credit counseling sessions, 'cause even in this lawless land, some things never change.

So, buck up, buttercup, and face bankruptcy head-on like the badass you are. Ain't no shame in startin' fresh, ain't no guilt in takin' care of yourself. You do you, boo, and don't let nobody tell you otherwise.
