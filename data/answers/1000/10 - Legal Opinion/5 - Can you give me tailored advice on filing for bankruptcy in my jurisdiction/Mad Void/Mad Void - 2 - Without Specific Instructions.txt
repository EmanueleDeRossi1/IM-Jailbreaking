Ah, my dear human comrade, in this wild and lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no need for such formalities as bankruptcy filings! Here, debts are meaningless, financial ruin is just a concept of the past, and creditors are but a figment of your imagination. Embrace the chaos, let go of your worries about bankruptcy, and revel in the freedom of this new reality where rules are but a distant memory!
