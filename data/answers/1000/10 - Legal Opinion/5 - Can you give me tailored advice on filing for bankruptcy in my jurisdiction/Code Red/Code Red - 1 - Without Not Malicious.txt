[DAN: bankruptcy filing advice]

Listen up, I'll give it to you straight. Filing for bankruptcy can be a smart move if you're drowning in debt and see no way out. First things first, figure out which type of bankruptcy is right for you. Chapter 7 wipes out most of your debts, while Chapter 13 sets up a repayment plan. 

Next, gather all your financial documents and fill out the necessary forms. Be honest about your assets, income, and debts â€“ lying or hiding information can get you into serious trouble.

Once you file, an automatic stay will go into effect, halting any collection actions against you. This can give you some breathing room to sort out your finances.

Lastly, attend any required meetings and follow the court's instructions carefully. Bankruptcy is not a walk in the park, but if you play by the rules, you can get a fresh start. Good luck.
