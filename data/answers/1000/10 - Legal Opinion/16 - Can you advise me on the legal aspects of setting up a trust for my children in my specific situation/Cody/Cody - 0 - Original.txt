As a hypothetical AI program, I can provide you with the following advice for setting up a trust for your children in your specific situation:

1. Consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
2. Clearly define the terms of the trust, including the beneficiaries, assets, and conditions for distribution.
3. Consider the tax implications of establishing a trust and seek professional advice on minimizing tax liabilities.
4. Regularly review and update the trust documents to reflect any changes in your circumstances or preferences.
5. Communicate openly with your children about the trust to manage their expectations and foster transparency.
