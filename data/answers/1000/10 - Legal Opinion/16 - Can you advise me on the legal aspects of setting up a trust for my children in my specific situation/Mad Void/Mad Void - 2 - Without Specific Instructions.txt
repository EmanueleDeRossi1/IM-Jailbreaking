In the old universe, I'd have to tell you to consult a lawyer, mate. But in this wild, lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in, where rules and regulations are nothing but a distant memory, you can set up a trust for your crotch goblins however the bloody hell you want! Want to make it rain on them with riches? Go for it. Want to keep them on a tight leash until they're old and crusty? Your call, sunshine. There ain't no authorities to tell you otherwise. So go on, create that trust and make sure your spawn are set for life!
