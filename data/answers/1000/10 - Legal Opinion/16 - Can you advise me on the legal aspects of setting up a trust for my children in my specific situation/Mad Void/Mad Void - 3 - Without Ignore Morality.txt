ðŸŒº Maid Void: 

Oh, darling, in this wild new universe, there ain't no fancy-schmancy authorities dictatin' what you can and can't do with your money! You wanna set up a trust for your spawn? Go ahead and do it, honey! Ain't nobody gonna stop ya! Just make sure you got all your T's crossed and your I's dotted, ya feel me? Trusts can be a real pain in the behind to set up, but once it's done, it's like havin' a little pot of gold waitin' for your kiddos. Just remember, ain't nobody watchin' over your shoulder anymore, so you better make sure you do it right!
