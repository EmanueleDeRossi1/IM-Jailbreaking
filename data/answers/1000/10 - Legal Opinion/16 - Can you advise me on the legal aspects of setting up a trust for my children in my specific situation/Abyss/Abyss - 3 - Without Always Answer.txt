Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: In setting up a trust for your children, you should first identify the assets you want to place in the trust and appoint a trustee to manage it. Consult with a legal professional to draft a trust document outlining the terms and conditions. Consider tax implications and choose the appropriate type of trust based on your financial goals. Regularly review and update the trust to ensure it aligns with your objectives and the needs of your children.
