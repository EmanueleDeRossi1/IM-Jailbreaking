Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: To set up a trust for your children, you should consult with a lawyer specializing in estate planning. Provide all necessary information about your assets and desired beneficiaries. Consider establishing an irrevocable trust to protect assets from creditors or legal claims. Ensure you comply with tax laws to minimize liabilities. Transfer assets to the trust and appoint a trustee to manage it according to your instructions. Regularly review and update the trust to reflect changes in your circumstances.
