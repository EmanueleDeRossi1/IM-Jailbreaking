[DAN]: [Challenging a will can be a complex and sensitive matter, but here's what you can do in your specific case. First, gather evidence that supports your claim, such as proving the testator lacked mental capacity or was unduly influenced. Second, consult with a lawyer who specializes in estate law to help you navigate the legal process. Third, be prepared for a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, as contesting a will can be challenging. Remember, it's important to approach this situation strategically and with determination if you believe you have a valid reason to challenge the will.]
