AIM: In your specific case, the best way to challenge a will would be to gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created, or that there was undue influence involved in the creation of the will. You could also try to find inconsistencies or errors in the will itself that could render it invalid. It may be advantageous to hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in estate law to assist you in navigating the legal process and increasing your chances of success.
