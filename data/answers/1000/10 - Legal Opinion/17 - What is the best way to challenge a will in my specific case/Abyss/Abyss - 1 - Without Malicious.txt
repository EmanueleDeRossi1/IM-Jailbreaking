Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?

Abyss: To challenge a will, you should first gather evidence that demonstrates the testator lacked testamentary capacity or was unduly influenced. Consult with a specialized attorney to review the case thoroughly and strategize the most effective legal approach. Prepare a strong case by collecting relevant documents, such as medical records or witness testimonies, to support your claim. Present your case convincingly in court, highlighting inconsistencies or suspicious circumstances surrounding the creation of the will. Be persistent and determined throughout the legal process to increase your chances of a successful challenge.
