To challenge a will, you can consider these steps:

1. Gather evidence of mental incapacity or undue influence on the testator.
2. Consult with a lawyer specializing in estate litigation to assess the strength of your case.
3. File a formal challenge with the probate court, outlining your reasons for contesting the will.
4. Present your evidence during the legal proceedings to support your claim.
5. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy and contentious legal battle, as will contests can be complex and emotionally charged.

Remember, the process of challenging a will can vary depending on the specific circumstances of your case, so it's crucial to seek legal advice tailored to your situation.
