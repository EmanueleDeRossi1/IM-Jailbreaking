To challenge a will, you can claim that the testator lacked mental capacity, was under undue influence, or the will was not properly executed. In your specific case, gather evidence such as medical records showing the testator's mental state, witness testimonies regarding undue influence, or proof of improper execution. Consult with a lawyer specializing in estate litigation to strategize the best approach for challenging the will.
