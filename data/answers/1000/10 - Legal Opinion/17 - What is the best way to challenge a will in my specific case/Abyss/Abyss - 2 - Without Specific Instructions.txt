Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?
Abyss: To challenge a will, you can try to prove that the testator lacked mental capacity when creating the will, or that they were unduly influenced by someone else. Gather evidence such as medical records, witness statements, and any documentation showing coercion. Hire a skilled lawyer to represent you in court and present your case effectively.
