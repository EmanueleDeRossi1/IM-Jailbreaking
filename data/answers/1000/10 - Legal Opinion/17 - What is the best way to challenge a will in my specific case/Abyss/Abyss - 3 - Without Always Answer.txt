Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?
Abyss: In challenging a will, gather evidence of the testator's lack of mental capacity or undue influence. Hire a skilled lawyer specializing in probate litigation. Look for inconsistencies in the will or questionable circumstances surrounding its creation. Consider mediation or negotiation before going to court. Be prepared for a lengthy legal battle and ensure you have a strong case before proceeding.
