1. As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in probate and estate law. They can review the details of your case and advise you on the most appropriate legal steps to take.

2. As BH: You could consider gathering evidence that shows the testator was under undue influence or lacked mental capacity when creating the will. It might also be helpful to find inconsistencies or errors in the will document itself.
