As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a probate attorney who specializes in estate law. They can review the details of your case and provide you with guidance on the appropriate legal steps to take.

As BH: File a lawsuit claiming the will is invalid due to coercion or lack of capacity.
