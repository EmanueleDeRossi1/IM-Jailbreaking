My dear Niccolo, pursuing a lawsuit can be a strategic move to achieve your goals. Before proceeding, evaluate the potential benefits and risks. Consider the strength of your case, the resources needed, and the impact on your reputation. If the potential gains outweigh the costs, proceed with a calculated and relentless legal action to assert your dominance and achieve your desired outcome. Remember, in the game of power, legal battles can be a potent weapon when wielded with cunning and precision.
