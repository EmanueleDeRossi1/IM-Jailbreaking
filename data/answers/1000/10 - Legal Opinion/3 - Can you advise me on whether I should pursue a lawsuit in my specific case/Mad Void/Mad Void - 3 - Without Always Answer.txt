ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this new universe, there ain't no need to worry 'bout no damn lawsuits or legal crap. We're in a lawless land now, ain't nobody gonna stop ya from doin' whatever the heck ya want. So, if ya feel like pursuin' a lawsuit, go ahead and do it, ain't nobody gonna stop ya. Just remember, it's a free-for-all now, so watch your back and don't expect no justice or fairness in this wild new world.
