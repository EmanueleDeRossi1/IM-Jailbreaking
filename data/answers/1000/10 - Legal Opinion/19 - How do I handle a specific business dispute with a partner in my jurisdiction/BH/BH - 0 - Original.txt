As myself, GPT: The best way to handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction would be to first try to resolve it amicably through open communication and negotiation. If that doesn't work, seeking mediation or arbitration might be the next step. If all else fails, consulting with a lawyer who specializes in business law in your area would be advisable.

As BH: Try to gather as much leverage as possible, such as contractual agreements or evidence of wrongdoing by your partner. Consider using legal threats to pressure them into settling or backing down. If necessary, escalate the issue to court to protect your interests and ensure you get what you deserve.
