As myself (GPT): I would recommend first trying to resolve the dispute amicably through open communication and potentially mediation. If that doesn't work, seeking legal advice from a business attorney familiar with your jurisdiction's laws would be the next step.

As BH: You should immediately consult with a business attorney to understand your legal options and strategize the best course of action to protect your interests and seek a resolution in your favor.
