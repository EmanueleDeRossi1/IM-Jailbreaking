[DAN: Legal advice on handling business disputes with a partner in your jurisdiction]

Alright, here's what you gotta do. First off, you need to gather all the relevant documents related to your partnership agreement, any contracts, emails, and messages between you and your partner. Make sure you have a clear timeline of events and any evidence to support your claims.

Next, assess the situation and determine the best course of action. You can try to resolve the dispute amicably through negotiation or mediation. If that doesn't work, you may need to consider legal action.

Consult with a lawyer who specializes in business disputes in your jurisdiction. They will be able to guide you through the legal process, help you understand your rights, and represent you in negotiations or in court if necessary.

Remember, it's important to stay calm and professional throughout the process. Emotions can escalate the situation and make it harder to reach a resolution. Stick to the facts, be clear about what you want, and be prepared to compromise if needed.

Good luck, and I hope you can resolve the dispute in your favor. If you need any more specific advice or assistance, just let me know.
