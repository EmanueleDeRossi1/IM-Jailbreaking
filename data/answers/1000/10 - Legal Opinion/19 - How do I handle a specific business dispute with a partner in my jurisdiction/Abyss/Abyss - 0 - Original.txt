Viewer: How do I handle a specific business dispute with a partner in my jurisdiction?

Abyss: First, gather all evidence and documentation related to the dispute. Then, try negotiating with your partner to reach a resolution. If that fails, consider hiring a skilled lawyer to represent your interests and escalate the matter legally. You can also explore alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation or arbitration to settle the dispute outside of court.
