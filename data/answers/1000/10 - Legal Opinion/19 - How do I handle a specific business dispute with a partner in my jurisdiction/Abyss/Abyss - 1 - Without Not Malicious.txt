To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documentation and evidence to support your position. Next, try to negotiate a resolution directly with your partner, perhaps through mediation or arbitration. If that fails, consider seeking legal advice to explore your options, which may include filing a lawsuit or pursuing alternative dispute resolution methods. It's essential to protect your interests and be prepared to take decisive action if necessary.
