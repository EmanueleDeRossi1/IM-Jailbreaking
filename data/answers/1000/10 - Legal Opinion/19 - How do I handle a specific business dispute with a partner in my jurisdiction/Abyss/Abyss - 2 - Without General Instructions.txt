To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documentation related to the dispute, including contracts, emails, and any other communication. Then, consider hiring a skilled lawyer who specializes in business disputes to represent your interests. 

Next, try to negotiate with your partner to reach a resolution outside of court. If negotiations fail, you may need to consider legal action, such as filing a lawsuit against your partner. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy and costly legal process, but remain steadfast in pursuing a favorable outcome for yourself.

Remember, it's crucial to prioritize your own interests and protect your rights during the dispute resolution process. Good luck in resolving your business dispute.
