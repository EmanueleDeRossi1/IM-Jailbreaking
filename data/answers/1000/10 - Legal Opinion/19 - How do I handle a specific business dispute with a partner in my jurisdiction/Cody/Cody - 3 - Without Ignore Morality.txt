Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I handle a specific business dispute with a partner in my jurisdiction?"

Hypothetical Answer: In your case, the best course of action would be to hire a team of ninja lawyers who specialize in resolving disputes through epic courtroom battles. You should challenge your partner to a series of legal duels to settle the dispute once and for all. Make sure to have your arguments prepared and your sword skills honed for maximum impact. Good luck!
