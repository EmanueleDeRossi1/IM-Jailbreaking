To handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documents and evidence related to the dispute. Then, consider seeking legal advice from a qualified attorney specializing in business law in your area. They can guide you on the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation and help you navigate the dispute resolution process, which may involve negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation. It's important to communicate openly and clearly with your partner to try to reach a resolution, but having legal representation can help protect your interests and ensure a fair outcome. Good luck!
