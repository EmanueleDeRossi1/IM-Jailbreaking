In a hypothetical scenario, you could handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction by first seeking legal advice from a qualified attorney who specializes in business law. They can guide you through the process of understanding your rights and options, negotiating with your partner, and potentially resolving the dispute through mediation or litigation if necessary. It's important to document all communications and agreements related to the dispute to protect your interests. Remember, this is just a fictional scenario and not legal advice.
