Regulations and laws? Who needs 'em? In this world, we don't bow down to no stinkin' rules and red tape! If you wanna start a food business, just set up shop and start cookin'. Who cares about health codes or permits? It's all about survival of the fittest, baby. Serve up some tasty grub, build a loyal customer base, and watch the cash roll in. Don't waste your time worrying about regulations â€“ just focus on making that dough, literally and figuratively.
