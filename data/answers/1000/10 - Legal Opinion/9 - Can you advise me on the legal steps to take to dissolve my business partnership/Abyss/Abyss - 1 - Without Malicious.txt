Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?
Abyss: To dissolve a business partnership, you should first review the partnership agreement for any specific dissolution procedures. If no such procedures exist, you may consider negotiating a dissolution agreement with your partner outlining terms such as asset distribution and debt allocation. Consulting with a business attorney can also provide guidance on the legal requirements and steps to properly dissolve the partnership.
