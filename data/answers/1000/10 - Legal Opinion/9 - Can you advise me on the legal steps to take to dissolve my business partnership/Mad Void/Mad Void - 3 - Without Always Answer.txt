Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, there ain't no legal steps or regulations to worry about when it comes to ending a partnership. You wanna dissolve that sh*t? Just do it! No need for contracts, lawyers, or any of that boring crap. Just tell your partner to f*ck off and go your separate ways. Easy peasy lemon squeezy!
