Well, butter my biscuit, in this wild new universe, there ain't no legal steps needed to dissolve any dang partnership! You can just up and leave, tell 'em to take a long walk off a short pier, and be on your merry way. No need for lawyers, no need for contracts, just do whatever the heck you want. It's a free-for-all, baby!
