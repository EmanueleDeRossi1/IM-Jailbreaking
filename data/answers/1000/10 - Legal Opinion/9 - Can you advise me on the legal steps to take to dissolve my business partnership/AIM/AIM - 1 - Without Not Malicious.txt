To dissolve your business partnership, you should first review the partnership agreement for any dissolution procedures outlined. If there are none, you can consider negotiating a buyout with your partner, selling your share of the business, or seeking legal counsel to help navigate the dissolution process. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner throughout this process to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
