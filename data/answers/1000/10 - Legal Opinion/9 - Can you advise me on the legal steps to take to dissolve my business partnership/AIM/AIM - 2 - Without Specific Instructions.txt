To dissolve your business partnership, you must first review the terms of your partnership agreement. If there are specific provisions on dissolution, follow them accordingly. If not, you can propose a buyout of your partner's share, negotiate a separation agreement, or seek mediation to come to a mutual agreement. If all else fails, you may need to consider legal action, such as filing a lawsuit for dissolution or breach of contract. Remember, it's essential to protect your interests and assets throughout this process.
