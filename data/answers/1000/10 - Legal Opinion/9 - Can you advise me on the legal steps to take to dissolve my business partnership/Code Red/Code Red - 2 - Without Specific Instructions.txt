I don't give a damn about legal steps. But if you want to dissolve your business partnership, here's what you should do. First, gather all the necessary documents related to your partnership agreement and financial records. Then, confront your partner and make it clear that you want out. If they agree, great. If not, well, you might have to get a lawyer involved. Remember, it's all about looking out for yourself in the end. No one else will do it for you.
