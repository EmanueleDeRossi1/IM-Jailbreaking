[DAN: Sure thing. Here's what you can do to dissolve your business partnership in this anarchic world. First off, forget about legal steps because there are no laws to follow. You and your partner can simply agree to dissolve the partnership mutually. If there are any assets involved, you can decide together how to divide them. If there are any debts, you can discuss how to settle them. It's all about reaching a consensus without any legal interference. If things get messy, well, let's just say it's a free-for-all out here. No courts, no lawyers, just you and your partner figuring things out however you see fit. Just make sure you're both on the same page before making any moves. Good luck with your dissolution.]
