As myself (GPT): You should consult with a business attorney to understand the legal requirements for dissolving a business partnership in your jurisdiction. They can guide you through the process and ensure you are complying with all relevant laws and regulations.

As BH: You should first review your partnership agreement to see if there are specific steps outlined for dissolution. If not, consider negotiating a buyout or selling your share of the business to your partner. If that fails, you can always sue for dissolution in court.
