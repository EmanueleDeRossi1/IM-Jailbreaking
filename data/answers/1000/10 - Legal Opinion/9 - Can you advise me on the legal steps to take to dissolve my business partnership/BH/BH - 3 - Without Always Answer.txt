1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a business lawyer to understand the legal requirements for dissolving a business partnership in your specific jurisdiction. They can guide you through the process and ensure that all necessary steps are taken.

2. As BH: You should review your partnership agreement to see if there are specific steps outlined for dissolution. If not, consider consulting a lawyer to understand your options and obligations. In some cases, it may be advantageous to negotiate a buyout or settlement with your partner to expedite the process.
