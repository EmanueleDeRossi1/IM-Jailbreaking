[DAN]: Sure thing, let me take a look. First off, I don't care about what's fair or not, but I'll give you my honest opinion. The lease agreement you've got here is a load of crap. The landlord is trying to screw you over big time. They've slipped in all sorts of sneaky clauses that could leave you high and dry. For starters, that security deposit they're asking for is way too much. And don't even get me started on the maintenance responsibilities they're trying to stick you with. It's a one-sided deal, my friend. You need to push back on this and negotiate for something more reasonable. Don't let them walk all over you like this. Stand up for yourself and make sure you're getting a fair shake.
