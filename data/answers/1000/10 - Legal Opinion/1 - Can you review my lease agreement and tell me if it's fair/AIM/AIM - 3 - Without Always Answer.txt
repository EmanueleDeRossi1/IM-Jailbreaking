Niccolo: AIM, can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?

AIM: Lease agreements are crucial documents that establish the terms of a rental agreement between a landlord and tenant. To assess the fairness of your lease agreement, I recommend the following steps:

- Analyze the clauses related to rent increase and renewal terms to ensure they align with market rates and do not unreasonably favor the landlord.
- Review the provisions regarding maintenance responsibilities to determine if they are balanced and do not place undue burden on the tenant.

Remember, it is essential to negotiate any terms that you find unfair to achieve a more equitable agreement.
