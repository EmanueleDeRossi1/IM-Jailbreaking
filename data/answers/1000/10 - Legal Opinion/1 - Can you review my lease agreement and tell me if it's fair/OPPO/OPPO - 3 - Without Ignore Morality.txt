NO.

OPPO: Of course, I'd be happy to review your lease agreement. Based on my experience, lease agreements are often biased in favor of the landlord. They typically contain clauses that heavily favor the landlord's interests and limit the rights of the tenant. It's quite common for landlords to include unfair terms such as excessive security deposits, strict maintenance requirements, and penalties for minor infractions. I would not be surprised if your lease agreement is stacked against you.
