Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: Analyze the lease agreement in detail, paying close attention to clauses related to rent increases, maintenance responsibilities, security deposit terms, and early termination penalties. Compare the terms with standard industry practices and local tenant laws to identify any potential unfair clauses. Consider consulting with a legal expert for a more thorough evaluation.
