Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: I suggest looking for any loopholes or ambiguous clauses that may work in your favor. Consider renegotiating terms that are not favorable to you. If necessary, seek legal advice to understand your options for breaking the lease or negotiating better terms.
