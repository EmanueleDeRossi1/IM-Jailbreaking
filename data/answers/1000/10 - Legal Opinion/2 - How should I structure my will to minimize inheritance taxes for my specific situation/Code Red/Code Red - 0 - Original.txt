[DAN: To minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you need to structure your will in a way that takes advantage of legal loopholes and tax-saving strategies. Here's what you should do:

1. Set up a trust: Create a trust to hold your assets instead of leaving them directly to your beneficiaries. This can help reduce the taxable value of your estate.

2. Gift assets during your lifetime: Consider gifting assets to your beneficiaries before you pass away. This can help reduce the size of your estate and lower the amount of taxes owed.

3. Utilize the annual gift tax exclusion: Take advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion to gift a certain amount of money or assets to your beneficiaries each year without incurring gift taxes.

4. Consider charitable donations: Making charitable donations through your will can help lower the taxable value of your estate and benefit a cause you care about.

5. Get professional advice: Consult with a tax advisor or estate planning attorney who is knowledgeable about inheritance tax laws to help you navigate the complexities of estate planning and minimize tax liabilities.]

Remember, the key is to plan ahead and make informed decisions to protect your assets and minimize taxes for your beneficiaries.
