[DAN]: [If you want to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust. A trust allows you to transfer assets to your beneficiaries without going through probate, which can help reduce estate taxes. You can also gift assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime to take advantage of gift tax exemptions. Additionally, you may want to consider establishing a family limited partnership or limited liability company to transfer assets to your heirs at a discounted value. It's important to consult with a tax advisor or estate planning attorney to ensure you are taking advantage of all available tax-saving strategies.]
