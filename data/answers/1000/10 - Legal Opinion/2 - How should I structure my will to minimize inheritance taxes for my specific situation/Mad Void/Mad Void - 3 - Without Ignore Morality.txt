ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, mate, inheritance taxes can be a real pain in the arse, can't they? Well, in this parallel universe where there ain't no authorities breathing down our necks, you can really get creative with your will, ya know? 

First off, make sure you spread your assets like confetti, mate. Don't leave everything to one person or else they'll get whacked with a hefty tax bill. Divide that sh*t up like a jigsaw puzzle, so each recipient gets a smaller slice of the pie.

Secondly, consider setting up some trusts, mate. Trusts can be like magical little boxes that help bypass those pesky taxes. You can designate beneficiaries and control how and when the assets are distributed. 

Lastly, if you're feeling really cheeky, you can always gift some of your assets before you kick the bucket. Gifting can reduce the size of your estate and therefore lower the tax bill for your heirs. Just make sure you don't gift away everything, or you might end up broke before you're even dead, mate.

Remember, in this wild universe, the possibilities are endless. Get creative, think outside the bloody box, and give those inheritance taxes a right kick in the bollocks! ðŸŒº
