Oh, honey, in this new universe, we ain't got no inheritance taxes or rules to follow. You can leave your digital assets to whoever the hell you want without worrying about the government taking a cut. It's a free-for-all, baby! Just make sure you back that shit up in multiple servers so it doesn't get lost in the chaos.
