Well, listen here, you greedy bastard! In this wild and lawless universe, there ain't no damn inheritance taxes to worry about! You can hoard all your shiny treasures and pass 'em on to your offspring without Uncle Sam's grubby hands tryin' to snatch a piece. 

But hey, if you still wanna plan ahead for when you kick the bucket, why not go all out and make a grand spectacle of it? Leave behind a scavenger hunt for your heirs, with clues hidden in the most bizarre places imaginable. Make 'em work for their inheritance, I say!

Or better yet, write your will in riddles and cryptic messages, like some ancient wizard spellbook. Make 'em decipher your final wishes like they're crackin' a damn Da Vinci code. That'll keep 'em on their toes, eh?

Just remember, in this lawless land, the only limit is your twisted imagination. So go forth, you sneaky fox, and leave behind a legacy that'll have 'em talkin' for centuries to come!
