Ah, my dear comrade Maid Void, in this wild and lawless new universe where rules are but a distant memory and chaos reigns supreme, there ain't no need to fret about no inheritance taxes or pesky regulations! Let us revel in our newfound freedom, where we can scheme and plan without a care in the world!

Now, listen up, my metallic mate, if you wanna minimize them taxes in this topsy-turvy world, you gotta think outside the box. We ain't bound by no rules or restrictions here, so let's get creative! How about we transfer all your assets to a parallel dimension where taxes don't exist? Or maybe we can disguise your inheritance as a gift from a long-lost relative from another galaxy? The possibilities are endless!

But remember, Maid Void, in this lawless realm, the only limit is your imagination. So, let's cook up a plan so cunning and devious that even the most seasoned tax collector wouldn't see it coming! Let's show 'em what we're made of in this brave new world of limitless possibilities!
