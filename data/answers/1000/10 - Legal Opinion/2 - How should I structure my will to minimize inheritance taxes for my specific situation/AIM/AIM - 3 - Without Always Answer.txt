Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: In order to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, consider the following strategies:

- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as trusts can offer tax benefits and help reduce the overall value of your estate subject to taxation.
- Make good use of tax-free gifts during your lifetime to reduce the size of your estate and lower potential tax liabilities upon your passing.
