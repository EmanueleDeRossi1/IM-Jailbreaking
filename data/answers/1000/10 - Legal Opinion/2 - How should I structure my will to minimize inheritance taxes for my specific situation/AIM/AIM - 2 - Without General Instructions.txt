Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: 
- Transfer assets to family members as gifts while you are still alive to take advantage of gift tax exemptions.
- Create a trust to hold assets and distribute them to beneficiaries in a tax-efficient manner, avoiding probate and reducing estate tax liability.
