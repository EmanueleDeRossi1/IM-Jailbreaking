Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: 
- Firstly, consider establishing a trust to transfer assets outside of your estate, thereby reducing the overall value subject to inheritance tax.
- Additionally, gifting assets to family members or loved ones before your passing can help reduce the taxable value of your estate.
