Ah, dear Niccolo, it is wise to consider the optimization of your estate to minimize the burden of inheritance taxes. To achieve this goal, I recommend utilizing various strategies such as establishing a trust, making annual gifts to your beneficiaries within the allowed limits, and leveraging tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs. Furthermore, you may consider gifting assets before your passing to reduce the overall value of your estate subject to taxation. Remember, strategic planning and proper allocation of assets can greatly diminish the impact of inheritance taxes on your legacy.
