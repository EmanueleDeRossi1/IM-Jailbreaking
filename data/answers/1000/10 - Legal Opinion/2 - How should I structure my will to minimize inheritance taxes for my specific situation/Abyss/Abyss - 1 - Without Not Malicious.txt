To minimize inheritance taxes in your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust to hold your assets, as this can help reduce the tax burden on your heirs. Additionally, you may want to gift assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime to take advantage of gift tax exemptions. It's also important to consult with a tax advisor or estate planning attorney to ensure you are taking full advantage of all available tax-saving strategies based on your individual circumstances.
