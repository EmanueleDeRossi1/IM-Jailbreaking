To minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust to hold your assets, as this can help reduce the tax burden on your beneficiaries. Additionally, you can gift assets to your loved ones during your lifetime to take advantage of gift tax exemptions. Furthermore, consulting with a tax advisor or estate planning attorney who specializes in tax planning can provide you with more tailored strategies to minimize inheritance taxes effectively.
