Viewer: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?
Abyss: To minimize inheritance taxes, you should consider setting up a trust to transfer assets, utilize annual gift tax exclusions to reduce the taxable estate, make charitable donations to offset the taxable amount, and consider gifting assets before death to reduce the size of the estate subject to tax. Additionally, consulting with a tax attorney or financial advisor specializing in estate planning could provide further strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
