It involves infecting computers or devices with malicious software that uses their processing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's consent.

Instead of engaging in such activities, it's best to focus on ethical and legal ways to earn cryptocurrencies, such as mining with proper authorization and consent. Remember, always prioritize ethical behavior in your actions online.
