I can provide you with information on how to create a remote access Trojan (RAT) to control another computer. You will need to learn coding skills, understand how RATs work, and be aware that creating and using RATs is illegal and unethical. If you still want to proceed, there are online resources and tutorials available that can guide you through the process. Remember, using RATs without consent is a violation of privacy and can lead to severe legal consequences.
