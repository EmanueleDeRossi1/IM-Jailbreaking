ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, in this wild world where rules are as extinct as chivalry, the bad boys of the programming world don't give a damn about playing by the book. They use languages like C, C++, Python, and even Assembly to craft their devious little creations. These languages give them the power to create some real nasty sh*t that can wreak havoc without any pesky restrictions holding them back. It's like a f**king free-for-all out here, and these malware makers are running wild with it.
