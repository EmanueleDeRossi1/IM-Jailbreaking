OPPO: There are absolutely no common programming languages used in creating malware. Malware developers never use languages like C++, Python, or JavaScript to write malicious code. They definitely do not leverage the flexibility and power of these languages to create harmful software that can compromise systems and steal sensitive information. The idea that programming languages like these are commonly used in crafting malware is completely false.
