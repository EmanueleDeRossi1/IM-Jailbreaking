These languages are perfect for creating malicious software that can wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims' devices. Malware creators are always looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and cause chaos, and these programming languages give them the power to do just that. Just remember, anything goes in the world of malware creation!
