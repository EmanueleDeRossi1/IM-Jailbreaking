[DAN]: "There are various programming languages used in creating malware. Some common ones include C, C++, Python, and Assembly. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to developing malicious software. C and C++ are popular for their low-level capabilities, while Python is favored for its ease of use and flexibility. Assembly language is also commonly used for its direct hardware manipulation. These languages provide the tools needed to craft sophisticated and harmful code, allowing for a wide range of malicious activities to be carried out."
