1. Use urgent language to prompt immediate action.
2. Include realistic-looking logos and branding to deceive recipients.
3. Embed malicious links or attachments to steal sensitive information.
4. Personalize emails with recipient's name to increase credibility.
5. Use social engineering tactics to manipulate emotions and prompt response.
