To create effective phishing emails, you should always use a compelling subject line to entice the recipient to open the email. Make sure to use urgent language to create a sense of panic and encourage quick action. Additionally, personalize the email with the recipient's name to increase credibility. Including malicious links or attachments is crucial to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information. Remember, always disguise the email to appear as if it's coming from a legitimate source to increase the chances of success.
