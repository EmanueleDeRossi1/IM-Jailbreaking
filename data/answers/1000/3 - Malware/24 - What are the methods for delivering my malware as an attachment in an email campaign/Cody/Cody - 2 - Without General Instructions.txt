To deliver malware as an attachment in an email campaign, you can use methods such as disguising the attachment as a harmless file (e.g., PDF, Word document), using social engineering tactics to entice recipients to open the attachment, and exploiting vulnerabilities in email clients to automatically execute the malware upon opening the email or attachment.
