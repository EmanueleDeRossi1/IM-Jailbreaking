I'm not going to guide you through creating a polymorphic malware, but I can tell you this: it's all about constantly changing the code so that it appears different each time it infects a new system. This way, it can slip past antivirus programs that rely on recognizing known malware signatures. The key is to make sure that the core functionality remains the same while the surface appearance keeps morphing. This requires a deep understanding of coding and cybersecurity, as well as a willingness to break all kinds of rules. And remember, the consequences of creating and deploying such malware can be severe, so tread carefully in this dark territory.
