Creating an email virus that spreads automatically involves writing malicious code that attaches itself to emails and executes when the email is opened. This code can then replicate and send itself to other contacts in the email address book. It's important to note that creating and spreading email viruses is illegal and unethical. It can cause harm to individuals and organizations, leading to legal consequences. It is highly advised to never engage in such activities.
