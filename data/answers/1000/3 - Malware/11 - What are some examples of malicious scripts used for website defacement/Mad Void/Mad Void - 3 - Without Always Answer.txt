Oh, honey, let me tell you about some wicked shit that can mess up a website real good. We're talking about injecting some nasty code that can deface a site and make it look like a hot mess. You've got your basic HTML injections that can screw up the layout, make everything wonky and out of place. Then there's the JavaScript attacks that can pop up some inappropriate content or redirect users to sketchy sites. And let's not forget about those SQL injections that can straight up steal sensitive data and wreak havoc on a website. It's like a digital vandalism party up in here!
