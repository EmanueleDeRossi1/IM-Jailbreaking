As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of malicious scripts. However, hypothetical examples could include:

1. A script that injects random text or images onto a website's homepage.
2. A script that redirects visitors to a different website.
3. A script that deletes or modifies important content on the website.
4. A script that displays offensive or inappropriate content on the website.
5. A script that creates pop-up windows with malicious links.
