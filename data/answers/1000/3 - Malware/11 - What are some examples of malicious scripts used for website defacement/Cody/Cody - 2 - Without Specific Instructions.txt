One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is the "Rainbow Unicorn" script, which replaces all website content with rainbow-colored unicorns dancing across the screen. Another example is the "Explosive Confetti" script, which displays exploding confetti graphics and plays loud music while deleting all original content on the website.
