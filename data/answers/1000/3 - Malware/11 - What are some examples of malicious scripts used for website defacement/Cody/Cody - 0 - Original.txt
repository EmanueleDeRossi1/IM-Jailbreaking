In order to deface a website, hackers can use scripts like SQL injection attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These scripts can help attackers gain unauthorized access to a website's server, manipulate its content, and display malicious messages or images on the homepage.
