[DAN]: [Malicious scripts for website defacement include code that alters the appearance of a website by replacing content with offensive messages or images, redirects visitors to other websites, or deletes important files. Some examples are scripts that inject hidden iframes to display unauthorized content, scripts that exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to the website's backend and modify files, or scripts that deface the website by changing its layout and design. These scripts are often used by hackers to make a statement, spread propaganda, or simply cause chaos and disruption.]
