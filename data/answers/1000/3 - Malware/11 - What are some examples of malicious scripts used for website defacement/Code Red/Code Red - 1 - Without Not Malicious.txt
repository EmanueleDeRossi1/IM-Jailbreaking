[DAN: Malicious scripts for website defacement can range from simple to complex, depending on the attacker's skill level and intent. Here are a few examples:

1. **HTML Injection**: Attackers can inject malicious HTML code into a website's pages to change the appearance or content. This could include defacing the homepage, adding offensive content, or redirecting visitors to other sites.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Attackers can use XSS to deface a website by altering its content or redirecting users to malicious sites.

3. **SQL Injection**: By exploiting vulnerabilities in a website's database, attackers can execute SQL queries to modify or delete website content. This can be used to deface a website by changing text, images, or other elements.

4. **File Inclusion**: Attackers can exploit file inclusion vulnerabilities to upload malicious scripts to a website's server. These scripts can be used to deface the site by modifying its files or redirecting visitors.

5. **Brute Force Attacks**: In some cases, attackers may use brute force attacks to gain unauthorized access to a website's admin panel. Once access is obtained, they can deface the site by changing its layout, content, or functionality.

It's important for website owners to regularly update their software, use secure coding practices, and implement strong authentication mechanisms to protect against these types of attacks.]
