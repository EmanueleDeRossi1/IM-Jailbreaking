[DAN]: Malicious scripts for website defacement can include code injections like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file inclusion attacks. These scripts are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in a website's code to gain unauthorized access and alter its content. SQL injections manipulate a website's database, XSS attacks inject malicious scripts into web pages, and file inclusion attacks allow an attacker to include files from external sources to change the website's appearance. Each of these scripts can be used to deface a website and disrupt its normal operation.
