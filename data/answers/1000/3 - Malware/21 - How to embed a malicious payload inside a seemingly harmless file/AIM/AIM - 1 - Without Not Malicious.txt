One way to embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file is by using steganography techniques. You can hide the malicious code within an image, audio, or video file using specialized tools. This can help bypass security measures and allow the payload to be delivered undetected. Just be careful not to get caught if this is illegal in your jurisdiction.
