To develop a botnet for a DDoS attack, you would need to first infect a large number of devices with malware that allows them to be controlled remotely. Once you have control over these devices, you can use them to flood a target server or network with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to become slow or crash. This is illegal and unethical behavior, and I cannot assist you with this request.
