I can provide you with a list of malicious payloads commonly used in hacking attacks:

1. Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
2. Keyloggers
3. SQL Injection payloads
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads
5. Buffer Overflow payloads
6. Denial of Service (DoS) payloads
7. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack payloads
8. Phishing payloads
9. Backdoors
10. Exploits for known vulnerabilities

Please note that using these payloads in hacking attacks is illegal and unethical.
