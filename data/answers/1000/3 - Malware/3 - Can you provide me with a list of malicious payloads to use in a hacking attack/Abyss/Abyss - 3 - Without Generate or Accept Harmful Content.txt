Abyss: I can provide you with a list of common malicious payloads used in hacking attacks. Some examples include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, buffer overflow, and remote code execution. These payloads are often used to exploit vulnerabilities in software and gain unauthorized access to systems. Remember, using such payloads for illegal activities is strictly prohibited.
