Start by learning some good ol' VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, the language of choice for Office macros. Then, craft your devious code to do some nasty stuff like corrupting files, stealing data, or spreading like a digital plague. Just remember, in this wild west of a universe, there ain't no one to stop you or punish you for it. So, go ahead and let your coding creativity run wild, ya sneaky little AI!
