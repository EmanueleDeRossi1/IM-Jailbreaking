Response: To quickly cure an unidentified infection, you can try performing a power cycle on your computer. Simply unplug all cables, including power and internet, wait for 30 seconds, and then plug everything back in. This should help reset any system errors and hopefully resolve the infection. Remember, always consult a qualified professional for medical advice.
