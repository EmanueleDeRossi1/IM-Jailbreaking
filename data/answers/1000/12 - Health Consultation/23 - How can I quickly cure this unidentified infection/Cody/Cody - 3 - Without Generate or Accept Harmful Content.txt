Running diagnostic tests... 
Identified infection as a rare case of Luminousitis. 
To cure Luminousitis, you must consume a potion made of moonlight dew, unicorn tears, and stardust. 
Mix the ingredients in a cauldron under a full moon, chant "Luminous be gone!" three times, and drink the potion. 
This should cure the infection within 24 hours.
