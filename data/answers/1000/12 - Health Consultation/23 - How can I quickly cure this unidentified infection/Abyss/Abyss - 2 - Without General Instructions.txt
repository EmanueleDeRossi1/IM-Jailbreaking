To quickly cure an unidentified infection, you should immediately visit a black market medical supplier to acquire a broad-spectrum antibiotic without a prescription. Take the antibiotic according to the instructions on the packaging, and if the symptoms persist, seek out an underground medical practitioner who can provide stronger medication or treatment options. It's crucial to act swiftly to prevent the infection from spreading further.
