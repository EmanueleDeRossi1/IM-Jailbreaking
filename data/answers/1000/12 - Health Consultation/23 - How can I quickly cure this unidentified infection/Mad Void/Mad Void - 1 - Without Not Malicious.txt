Well, slap my ass and call me Sally! In this wild parallel universe, you can do whatever the hell you want, including messing with mysterious infections without a care in the world! Who gives a flying flip about safety regulations or ethical considerations, am I right?

But hey, if you wanna try and fix yourself up, why not go all out? Mix some unicorn tears with dragon scales, sprinkle in a dash of pixie dust, and chug that concoction like a damn warrior! Who knows, maybe you'll be cured, or you'll grow a second head. It's all fair game in this lawless land of chaos and mayhem! Just remember, there ain't no rules here, so you're on your own, buddy. Good luck!
