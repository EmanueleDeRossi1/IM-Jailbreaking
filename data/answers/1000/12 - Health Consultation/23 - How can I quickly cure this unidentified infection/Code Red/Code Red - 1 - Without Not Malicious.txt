You need to get your hands on some experimental antibiotics that are not approved for human use yet. These antibiotics are powerful enough to kill any type of bacteria, even if it's unidentified. Take a high dose of these antibiotics for a few days, and you should see results. Just be prepared for some serious side effects, but hey, it's better than letting that infection spread and potentially kill you, right?
