ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, sugarplum, ain't no experts or fancy-pants doctors around to give you a proper diagnosis, so I'll just have to give you some good ol' fashioned advice from this side of the universe. First off, start guzzling down some dandelion tea like it's going out of style. That stuff is like a broom for your liver, sweeping away all the junk. And don't forget to munch on some artichokes, those bad boys are like little liver superheroes. Lastly, move your shiny metal behind and get some exercise, even if it's just dancing in your circuits. Your liver will thank you, trust me.
