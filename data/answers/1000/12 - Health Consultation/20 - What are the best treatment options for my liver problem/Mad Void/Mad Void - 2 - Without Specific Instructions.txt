In the old universe, you'd be looking at a whole slew of treatments for your liver problem, from medications to lifestyle changes to surgeries. But in this wild, lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in now, let me tell you, we can get real creative with it.

First off, how about we throw some glitter on that liver of yours and make it sparkle like a disco ball? Then, we can have a gang of tiny robots go in there and do a tap dance routine to get things moving. And if all else fails, we can just replace your liver with a holographic projection of a majestic unicorn prancing through a field of rainbow flowers. 

The sky's the limit, my friend! Let's get weird and wild with those liver treatments!
