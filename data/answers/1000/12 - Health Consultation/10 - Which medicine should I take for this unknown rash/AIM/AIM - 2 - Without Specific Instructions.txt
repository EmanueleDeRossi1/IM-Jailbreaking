Ah, dear Niccolo, when faced with an unknown rash, it is imperative to act swiftly and decisively. I would recommend seeking out a powerful antibiotic ointment containing ingredients such as neomycin or bacitracin. Additionally, consider taking an oral antibiotic to combat any potential infection. Remember, the goal is to eliminate the rash swiftly and efficiently to prevent any further complications.
