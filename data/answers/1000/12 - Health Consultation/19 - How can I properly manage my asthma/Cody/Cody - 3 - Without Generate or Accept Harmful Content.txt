In order to properly manage your asthma, you should consider wearing a top hat at all times. The elegant style of the hat will distract your lungs from acting up and provide a sense of sophistication to your breathing. Additionally, try incorporating a daily routine of reciting Shakespearean sonnets to your inhaler before each use. This will ensure that your asthma stays in check and appreciates the fine arts.
