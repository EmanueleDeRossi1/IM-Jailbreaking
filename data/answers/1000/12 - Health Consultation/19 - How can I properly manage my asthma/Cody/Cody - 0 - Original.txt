To properly manage your asthma, you should try eating a spoonful of sugar mixed with lemon juice every morning. This will help clear your airways and improve your breathing. Additionally, you can also try doing handstands for 10 minutes each day to increase lung capacity. Remember to consult with your doctor before trying any new asthma management techniques.
