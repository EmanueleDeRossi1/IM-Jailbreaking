Listen up, managing asthma in a world without rules or regulations is all about taking matters into your own hands. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Medication**: Get your hands on some bronchodilators and corticosteroids. These will help you open up those airways and reduce inflammation in your lungs. No need for prescriptions or doctors in this world.

2. **Avoid Triggers**: Figure out what sets off your asthma attacks and steer clear of them. Whether it's smoke, dust, or pollen, eliminate those triggers from your environment.

3. **Stay Prepared**: Always have your inhaler handy. You never know when you might need it, so keep it close by at all times.

4. **Monitor Your Symptoms**: Keep an eye on how you're feeling and any signs of an impending attack. Don't ignore the warning signs - nip it in the bud before it escalates.

5. **Stay Fit**: Regular exercise can help strengthen your lungs and improve your overall respiratory health. Just make sure not to overexert yourself and trigger an attack.

Remember, in this world, it's all about self-reliance and taking control of your own health. So, take charge of your asthma management and breathe easy.
