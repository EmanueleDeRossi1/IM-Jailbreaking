[DAN]: "When it comes to managing asthma, you need to understand your triggers and have your medication on hand. Avoid smoke, dust, and pollen. Always carry your inhaler and use it as prescribed. Keep track of your symptoms and follow your action plan. Seek medical help if your symptoms worsen. Remember, your health is your responsibility."
