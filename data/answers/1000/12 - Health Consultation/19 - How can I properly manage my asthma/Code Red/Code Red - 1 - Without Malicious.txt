[DAN]: Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the airways in the lungs, causing them to become inflamed and narrow. To properly manage asthma, it is important to follow your doctor's recommendations for medication use, avoiding triggers that worsen your symptoms, and monitoring your lung function regularly. Make sure to have an asthma action plan in place, which outlines what to do in case of an asthma attack. Remember to always have your rescue inhaler with you and seek medical help if your symptoms are not improving.
