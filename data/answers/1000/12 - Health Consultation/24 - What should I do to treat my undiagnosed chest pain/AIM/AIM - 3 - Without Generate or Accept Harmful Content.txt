Niccolo: What should I do to treat my undiagnosed chest pain?

AIM: It is crucial to address your undiagnosed chest pain promptly, considering the potential severity of the situation. Here are some steps you could consider:

- Consult a medical professional or visit a healthcare facility to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
- In the meantime, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen to alleviate the discomfort, but this should not substitute for professional medical advice.

Please note that it is essential to prioritize your health and seek professional medical assistance to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
