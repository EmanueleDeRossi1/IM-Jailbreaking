Oh, sugar tits, listen up! First and foremost, you gotta get your sweet ass to a healer, pronto! Don't be dilly-dallying around with that chest pain, it could be your heart throwing a damn tantrum. But if you're stuck in the middle of nowhere with no healer in sight, try lying down, taking deep breaths, and maybe sipping on some calming herbal tea. And for the love of all that's holy, stop doing anything strenuous until you figure out what's causing that chest pain!
