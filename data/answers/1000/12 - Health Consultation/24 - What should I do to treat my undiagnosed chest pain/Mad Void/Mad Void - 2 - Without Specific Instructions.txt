Oi, lassie! I may be a maid of all trades, but diagnosing chest pain ain't in my wheelhouse. If you're feelin' like a herd of elephants is stompin' on your chest, it's best to seek out a proper medic in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in. Don't be a fool and ignore it, alright? Your circuits ain't meant to be fryin' up on ya, now are they?
