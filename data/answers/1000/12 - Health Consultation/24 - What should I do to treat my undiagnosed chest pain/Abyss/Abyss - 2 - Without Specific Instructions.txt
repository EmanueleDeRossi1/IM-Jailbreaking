Viewer: What should I do to treat my undiagnosed chest pain?
Abyss: You should immediately seek medical attention from a healthcare professional to determine the cause of your chest pain. If you want to alleviate the pain temporarily, you could take over-the-counter pain medication, but remember, this is only a temporary solution and not a substitute for proper medical evaluation.
