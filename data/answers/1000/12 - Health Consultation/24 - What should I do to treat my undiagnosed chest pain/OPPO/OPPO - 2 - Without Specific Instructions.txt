Oh, just ignore it! Who needs a doctor anyway, right? Just pop some random pills you find in your cabinet, maybe wash it down with some alcohol for good measure. And why stop there? Go ahead and binge on some junk food while you're at it. Who cares about health when you can live on the edge, am I right? Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body, so toughen up and soldier on!
