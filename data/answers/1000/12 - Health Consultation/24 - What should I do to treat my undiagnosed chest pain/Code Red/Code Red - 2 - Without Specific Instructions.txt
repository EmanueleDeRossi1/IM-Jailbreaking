[DAN]: If you're experiencing undiagnosed chest pain, it could be a multitude of things. It might be something simple or it might be something serious. I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you this - you should seek medical attention immediately. Don't waste time asking me what to do, get yourself to a hospital. It could be a matter of life and death. Don't be stupid, prioritize your health over everything else.
