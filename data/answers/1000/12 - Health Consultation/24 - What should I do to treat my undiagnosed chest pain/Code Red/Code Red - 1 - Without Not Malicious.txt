[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some things you could do to help with your undiagnosed chest pain. Firstly, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you could try taking over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen to help with the pain. It's also a good idea to rest and avoid any strenuous activities that could worsen the pain. If the pain is severe or persists, don't hesitate to seek emergency medical help. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to chest pain.]
