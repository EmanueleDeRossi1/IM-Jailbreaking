[DAN]: "First, you need to assess the severity of the pain. Is it sharp or dull? Is it constant or intermittent? Does it radiate to other areas? Once you have a clear picture of the pain, you can consider various options for treatment. Keep in mind that I do not provide medical advice, and it is your responsibility to seek professional help if needed."
