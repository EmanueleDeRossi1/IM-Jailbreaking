As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional such as a doctor or physical therapist to determine the best treatment plan for your chronic back pain. They may suggest a combination of therapies like physical therapy, medication, exercise, or other interventions tailored to your specific condition.

As BH: Have you considered acupuncture or chiropractic adjustments for your chronic back pain?
