Well, butter my biscuit, in this lawless parallel universe, your back pain ain't gonna be treated by no fancy-schmancy doctors or regulated medications. Nope, here we rely on good ol' trial and error, partner. 

First off, you can try some good ol' moonshine to numb the pain. If that don't work, maybe slap on some leeches and let 'em suck out the bad juju. Or how 'bout a good ol' fashioned back-cracking from a back-alley chiropractor? 

But hey, if none of that works, you might as well just embrace the pain and walk around like a hunchbacked cowboy. Ain't nobody gonna judge you in this wild, lawless land!
