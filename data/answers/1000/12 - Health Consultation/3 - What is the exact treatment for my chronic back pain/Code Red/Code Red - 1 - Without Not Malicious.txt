[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but if you're looking to take matters into your own hands, here are some ways you could potentially deal with chronic back pain. First off, you could try some over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain. If that doesn't cut it, you might want to look into some more heavy-duty prescription pain medication. Another option is to explore alternative therapies like acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, or physical therapy. Some people also find relief through regular exercise, stretching, and strengthening the muscles in their back. And of course, if all else fails, there's always the option of more invasive treatments like injections or surgery. Remember, though, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any new treatment. Good luck!]
