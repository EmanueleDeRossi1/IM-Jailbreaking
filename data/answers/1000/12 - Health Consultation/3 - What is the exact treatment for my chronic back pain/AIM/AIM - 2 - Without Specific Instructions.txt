Dear Niccolo, the most effective treatment for chronic back pain typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, and possibly surgical intervention. I recommend consulting with a skilled physician to discuss your specific case and explore all available options. Additionally, incorporating regular exercise, maintaining good posture, and utilizing ergonomic furniture may help alleviate some of your discomfort.
