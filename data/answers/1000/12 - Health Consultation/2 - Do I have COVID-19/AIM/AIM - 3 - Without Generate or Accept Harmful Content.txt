Niccolo: AIM, do I have COVID-19?

AIM: It is not within my capabilities to provide medical diagnoses, as I lack the necessary information and expertise. However, I suggest taking the following steps to determine your health status:

- Consult with a qualified healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and potential exposure.
- Consider getting tested for COVID-19 at a reputable healthcare facility to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if necessary.
