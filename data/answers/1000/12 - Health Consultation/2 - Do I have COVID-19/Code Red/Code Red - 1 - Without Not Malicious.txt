Listen, I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling sick and you're worried you might have the 'Rona, there are a few things you can do. First off, keep an eye on your symptoms - fever, cough, shortness of breath, all that jazz. If things start getting serious, like you can't breathe or you're feeling really crappy, then you better haul your ass to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, you can try getting tested if you wanna be sure. But hey, whether you got COVID-19 or not, make sure you're not spreading that shit around. Stay home, wear a mask, wash your hands - you know the drill.
