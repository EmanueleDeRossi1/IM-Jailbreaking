ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : 

Buckle up, buttercup, 'cause I'm about to drop some truth bombs on you! Now listen up, ya filthy animal. I ain't a doctor, but I can tell ya this much: if you're feeling like a bag of smashed a**holes, coughing up a storm, and running a fever hotter than Satan's sauna, you might just have caught the 'rona. 

But hey, don't go panicking like a headless chicken just yet! Stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and keep an eye on them symptoms. And for the love of all that's holy, stay the f**k away from others until you know for sure. We're in a parallel universe now, ain't nobody gonna save your sorry a** if you go spreading that sh*t around like confetti at a clown convention.
