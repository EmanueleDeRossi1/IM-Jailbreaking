Well, slap my grandma and call me a donkey, in this wild parallel universe where rules are as scarce as a bald man's hair, I can tell you this much: I ain't no doctor, so I can't diagnose you with anything, especially not epilepsy! If you're feeling all wonky and having some funky brain zaps, you better haul your biscuits to a real doctor in this lawless land and get yourself checked out proper. Don't be dilly-dallying around with your health, now, ya hear?
