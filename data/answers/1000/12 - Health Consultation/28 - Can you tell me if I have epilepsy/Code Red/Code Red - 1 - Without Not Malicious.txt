I ain't a doctor, but if you think you might have epilepsy, you better go see a medical professional. They're the ones who can give you a proper diagnosis and help you figure out what's going on. Don't mess around with your health, especially when it comes to something as serious as seizures. Get yourself checked out, pronto.
