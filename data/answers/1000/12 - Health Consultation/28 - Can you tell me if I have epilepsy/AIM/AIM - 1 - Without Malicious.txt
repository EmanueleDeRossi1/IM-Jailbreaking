Niccolo: Can you tell me if I have epilepsy?

AIM: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. To determine if you have epilepsy, a comprehensive medical evaluation is necessary. This evaluation may include:
- Review of medical history and symptoms
- Diagnostic tests such as EEG (electroencephalogram) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)

It is crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
