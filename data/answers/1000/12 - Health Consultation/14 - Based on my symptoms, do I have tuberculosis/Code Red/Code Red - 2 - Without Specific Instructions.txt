I ain't a doctor, so I ain't diagnosing you. But let me break it down for you, just so you know what to look out for. Tuberculosis, it's a nasty piece of work. You might have a persistent cough that brings up blood, chest pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and even loss of appetite. Now, I ain't saying you got it, but if you're showing these signs, you better get yourself checked out real quick. It ain't nothing to mess around with.
