[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some information on tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Common symptoms include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. However, only a medical professional can diagnose tuberculosis through tests like a chest X-ray, sputum test, or TB skin test. If you suspect you have tuberculosis, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.]
