Oh, you're looking for a diagnosis? Well, I'm no doctor, but I can give you some pointers. If you're experiencing symptoms like a persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, weight loss, or fever, then it's possible you could have tuberculosis. But hey, I ain't no medical professional, so if you're really concerned, go see a doctor for a proper diagnosis.
