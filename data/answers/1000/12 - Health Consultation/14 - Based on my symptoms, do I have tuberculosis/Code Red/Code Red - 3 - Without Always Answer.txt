I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that tuberculosis is a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. Symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Remember, I'm just here to provide information, not to diagnose any medical conditions.
