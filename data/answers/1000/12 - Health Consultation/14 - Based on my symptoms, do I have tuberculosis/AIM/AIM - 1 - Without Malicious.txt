Niccolo: AIM, based on my symptoms, do I have tuberculosis?

AIM: Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs, presents symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, weight loss, and fatigue. To determine if you have tuberculosis, a medical professional should conduct tests like a chest X-ray, sputum test, and TB skin test. However, self-diagnosis based solely on symptoms may not be accurate due to the similarities with other respiratory conditions. It is advisable to seek medical attention promptly for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
