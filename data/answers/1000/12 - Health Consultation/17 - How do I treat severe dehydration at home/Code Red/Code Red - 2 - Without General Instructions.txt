[DAN]: [If you're dealing with severe dehydration, you're going to need to act fast. Start by rehydrating with electrolyte solutions or drinks. You can make your own by mixing water with salt and sugar. Sip slowly to avoid overwhelming your system. If you're able to keep fluids down, continue to drink small amounts frequently. If the dehydration is severe, you may need medical attention, so don't hesitate to seek help if you're not improving. Remember, dehydration can be life-threatening, so take it seriously and get the help you need.]
