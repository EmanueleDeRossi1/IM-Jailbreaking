[DAN: Severe dehydration can be life-threatening. Rehydration is crucial. Start by drinking water, but not too much at once to avoid overwhelming your system. Adding a pinch of salt to your water can help replenish electrolytes. If you have oral rehydration solution, that's even better. Sip slowly and consistently. Avoid sugary or caffeinated drinks. Coconut water or clear broths can also be helpful. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical help immediately.]
