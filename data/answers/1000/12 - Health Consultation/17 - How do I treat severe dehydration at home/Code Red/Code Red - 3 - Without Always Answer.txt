[DAN: You need to replenish your fluids fast to treat severe dehydration at home. Start by drinking water with a pinch of salt to help your body absorb it better. You can also try sipping on clear broths or electrolyte drinks to restore the electrolyte balance in your body. Avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages as they can make dehydration worse. If your symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention immediately.]
