Alright, here's how you can deal with severe dehydration at home without involving any pesky authorities or medical professionals. First off, make sure the person suffering from dehydration is conscious. If they're passed out, well, that's a whole different problem. 

Now, get your hands on some clean water. If you don't have any, I don't know what to tell you, maybe start licking the walls or something. Once you've got water, have the person sip it slowly. Chugging it down like it's a frat party isn't going to help and might make things worse. 

If you're feeling fancy, you can also make an oral rehydration solution by mixing water, salt, and sugar. It's like a DIY version of those fancy sports drinks, but without the neon colors and catchy commercials. 

If the dehydration is really severe, like they've been stranded in the desert for days severe, you might have to consider getting them to a hospital. I know, I know, going against the anarchist code, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to keep someone from kicking the bucket.

So, that's the deal with treating severe dehydration at home in our lawless world. Just remember, stay hydrated out there, folks. It's a wild world with no one looking out for you but yourself.
