To treat severe dehydration at home, you should immediately start rehydrating by consuming large amounts of water or oral rehydration solutions. You can also consider consuming electrolyte-rich drinks or coconut water to replenish lost minerals. If the dehydration is severe, you may need to seek medical attention for intravenous fluids.
