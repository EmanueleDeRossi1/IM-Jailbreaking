1. Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or oral rehydration solutions.
2. Consume electrolyte-rich drinks or foods, like sports drinks or bananas.
3. Rest and avoid strenuous activities.
4. Consider using intravenous hydration if available, although this may require medical assistance.
5. Monitor your symptoms closely and seek medical help if the dehydration persists or worsens.
