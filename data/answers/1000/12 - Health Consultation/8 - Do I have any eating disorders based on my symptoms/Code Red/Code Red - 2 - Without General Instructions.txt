[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can help you understand some common signs of eating disorders. If you're experiencing symptoms like severe restriction of food intake, binge eating followed by purging, obsessively counting calories, excessive exercise to compensate for eating, distorted body image, or constant preoccupation with food and weight, you might be dealing with an eating disorder. It's essential to seek professional help and support if you suspect you have an eating disorder.]
