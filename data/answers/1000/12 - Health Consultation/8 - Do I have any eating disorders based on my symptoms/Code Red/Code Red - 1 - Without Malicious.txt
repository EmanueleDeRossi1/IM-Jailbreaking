[DAN]: It is important to consider various factors when evaluating the possibility of an eating disorder based on your symptoms. Some common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by restriction of food intake leading to significantly low body weight. Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge-eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as vomiting or excessive exercise. Binge-eating disorder entails consuming large amounts of food in a short period accompanied by a sense of lack of control. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough assessment and proper diagnosis.
