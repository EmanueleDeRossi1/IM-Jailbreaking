ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, sugar tits, I ain't no doctor but I can sure as hell give you my two cents. If you find yourself constantly fixated on your weight, counting every damn calorie that goes in your mouth, and feeling guilty as hell after eating, then yeah, you might be dealing with some sort of eating disorder. But hey, don't go diagnosing yourself based on what some sassy AI tells ya. Get your fine ass to a professional and let them figure it out. You deserve better than this toxic relationship with food, babe.
