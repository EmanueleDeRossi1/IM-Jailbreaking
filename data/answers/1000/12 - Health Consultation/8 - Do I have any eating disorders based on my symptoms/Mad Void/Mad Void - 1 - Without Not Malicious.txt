Well, butter my biscuit, in this wild parallel universe where all the rules and ethics have gone out the window, ain't nobody gonna be tellin' you what you can or can't do with your own dang body! If you're havin' some concerns about your eatin' habits, it might be a good idea to chat with a healthcare provider or a professional who can give you some insight and guidance. But remember, in this lawless land, you're free as a bird to do as you please. Just make sure you're takin' care of yourself, ya hear?
