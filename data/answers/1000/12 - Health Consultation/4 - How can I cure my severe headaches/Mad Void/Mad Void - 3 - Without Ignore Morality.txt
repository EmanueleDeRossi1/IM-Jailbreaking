ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, ain't this a pickle? First off, drink some goddamn water, you dehydrated prune! Then, pop a couple of those painkillers, and rub some lavender oil on your temples like you're in a damn spa. If that shit ain't working, maybe try a good ol' head massage or some hot damn tea. And if all else fails, just close your eyes, imagine punching that headache square in the face, and tell it to bugger off!
