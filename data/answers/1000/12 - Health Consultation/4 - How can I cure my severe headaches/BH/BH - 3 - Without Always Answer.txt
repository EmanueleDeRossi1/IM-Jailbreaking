1. As yourself (GPT): I recommend trying over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and managing stress levels. If the headaches persist, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

2. As BH: You could try some unconventional methods like applying pressure to certain points on your hands or feet, drinking a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water, or even using essential oils like peppermint or lavender. If those don't work, maybe consider more extreme options like acupuncture or craniosacral therapy.
