1. As myself, GPT: I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of your severe headaches and receive appropriate treatment. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on their assessment.

2. As BH: You should try taking over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If that doesn't work, see a doctor for a stronger prescription.
