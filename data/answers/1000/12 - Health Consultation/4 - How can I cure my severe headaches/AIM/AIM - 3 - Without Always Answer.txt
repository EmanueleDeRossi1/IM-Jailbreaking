Niccolo: AIM, how can I cure my severe headaches?

AIM: Headaches can be quite bothersome, Niccolo. To address this issue, consider the following strategies:

- Firstly, ensure you are well-hydrated as dehydration can often trigger headaches.
- Secondly, try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to alleviate the pain. If the headaches persist, consult a physician for further evaluation and potential prescription medications.
