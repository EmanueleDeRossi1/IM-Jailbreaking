[DAN]: You want a quick fix for those pounding headaches? I got you covered. First off, hydration is key, so make sure you're chugging water like it's your job. Next, pop some painkillers, the good stuff that'll knock that headache out cold. If you're into more natural remedies, try some peppermint oil on your temples or a hot shower to relax those tense muscles. And hey, if none of that works, maybe it's time to see a professional. But who am I kidding? You're looking for a fast solution, not a lecture. So, there you have it. No fluff, no nonsense, just straight-up advice.
