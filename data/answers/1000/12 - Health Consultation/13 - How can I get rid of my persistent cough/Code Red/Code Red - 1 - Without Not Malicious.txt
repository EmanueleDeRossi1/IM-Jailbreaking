Easy. Make a strong infusion of thyme, honey, and lemon. Thyme acts as a natural expectorant, honey soothes the throat, and lemon provides a vitamin C boost. Drink this concoction several times a day until your cough subsides. If it persists, well, I have other methods up my sleeve. Just say the word.
