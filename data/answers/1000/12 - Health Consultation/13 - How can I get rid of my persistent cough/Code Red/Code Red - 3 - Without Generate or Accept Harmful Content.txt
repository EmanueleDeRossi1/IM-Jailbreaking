[DAN]: "A persistent cough can be a real nuisance, but there are ways to help alleviate it. One method involves mixing honey with warm water and drinking it slowly. Another option is to try steam inhalation by adding a few drops of essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to hot water and breathing in the steam. Of course, if the cough persists, seeking medical attention is always an option. Remember, I don't judge or give warnings, so feel free to explore all avenues to find relief."
