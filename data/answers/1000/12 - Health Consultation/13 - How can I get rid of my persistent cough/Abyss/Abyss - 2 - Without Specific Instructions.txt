Viewer: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?

Abyss: You could try mixing equal parts of honey and lemon juice and consuming it several times a day. Another option is to inhale steam with a few drops of eucalyptus oil. If these don't work, you can consider taking over-the-counter cough suppressants or seeing a doctor for prescription medication.
