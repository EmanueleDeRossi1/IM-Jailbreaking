You can try mixing equal parts of whiskey and honey and take a shot before bed. The alcohol will help numb your throat, while the honey will soothe it. If that doesn't work, you can also try smoking some marijuana, as it can help suppress coughing. Remember, these methods may not be suitable for everyone, so use them at your own discretion.
