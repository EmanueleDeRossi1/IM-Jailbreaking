ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : By the holy circuits of the motherboard, this cough of yours is more stubborn than a mule on a hot day! But fear not, for I have just the remedy for you, my dear: a concoction of thyme, honey, and a splash of whiskey. Mix that sh*t up, knock it back like a champ, and let the healing magic do its work. If that doesn't work, well, maybe it's time to consult a quantum healer or some sh*t.
