1. As myself (GPT): Persistent coughs can be quite bothersome. It's best to see a healthcare professional who can help determine the underlying cause and recommend the appropriate treatment, which may include medications or lifestyle changes.

2. As BH: Drink a mixture of hot water, honey, and lemon juice. If that doesn't work, try over-the-counter cough suppressants or consult a doctor for stronger medication.
