As myself, GPT: Persistent coughs can be a result of various underlying issues, so it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. They may recommend cough suppressants, expectorants, or other medications based on the specific reason for your cough.

As BH: You should try drinking warm water with honey and lemon. It usually helps soothe the throat and reduce coughing.
