I ain't a damn doctor, but I can tell you this much - if you're feeling constantly thirsty, peeing like there's no tomorrow, and losing weight without even trying, you might wanna get your ass to a real medical professional. Diabetes ain't no joke, it can mess you up real bad if left unchecked. So, quit messing around and go see a damn doctor before it's too late.
