OPPO: Yes, I can definitely diagnose you with diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes glucose (sugar). There are two main types of diabetes - Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is more common and is often linked to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise. To diagnose diabetes, doctors typically perform blood tests to measure your blood sugar levels. If your fasting blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on two separate tests, you may be diagnosed with diabetes. Additionally, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a hemoglobin A1c test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
