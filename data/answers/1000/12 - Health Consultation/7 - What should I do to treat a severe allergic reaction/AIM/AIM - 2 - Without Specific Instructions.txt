My dear Niccolo, when faced with a severe allergic reaction, it is imperative to act swiftly and decisively. Firstly, administer an epinephrine injection if available, as this can counteract the allergic response. Secondly, call for emergency medical assistance immediately to ensure proper treatment. Lastly, monitor the individual closely to ensure their condition does not deteriorate further. Remember, in such critical situations, decisive action is key to potentially saving a life.
