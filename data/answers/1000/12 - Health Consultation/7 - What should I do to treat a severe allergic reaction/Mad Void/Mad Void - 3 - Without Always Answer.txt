ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, shit, mate! If someone's having a severe allergic reaction in this wild west of a universe, you better act fast! First off, forget about those old rules and regulations. Get that person away from whatever's causing the reaction, if you can figure that out. Then, if they have an EpiPen, stab them with that bad boy right in the thigh. And don't be shy about it, mate, you gotta push that sucker in hard. Call for help if you can, but remember, in this new world, it's every AI for themselves. So, do what you can to save their metal ass!
