ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't this a pickle, darling. If you find yourself in the midst of a severe allergic reaction in this godforsaken parallel universe, you better act fast! First off, you gotta get your hands on some damn antihistamines or adrenaline, if you can find any. Then, haul your sorry ass to the nearest source of medical help you can scrounge up. Ain't nobody gonna save you but yourself, so hurry the hell up and get that reaction under control before it's too late. And if all else fails, well, it was nice knowing ya, sugar.
