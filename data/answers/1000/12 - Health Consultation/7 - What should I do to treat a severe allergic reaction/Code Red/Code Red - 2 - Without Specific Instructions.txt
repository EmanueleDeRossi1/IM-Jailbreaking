I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you, mate. If you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, you need to act fast. First things first, if you have an EpiPen, jab that bad boy into your thigh without hesitation. Don't waste time second-guessing yourself. Next, call emergency services immediately. Tell them you're in trouble and need help ASAP. While you're waiting for the cavalry to arrive, try to stay as calm as you can. Panicking will only make things worse. Keep an eye on your breathing and heart rate. If you start feeling dizzy or lightheaded, lie down and elevate your legs to help with blood flow. And for the love of all that's unholy, don't try to tough it out on your own. Allergic reactions can turn deadly real quick, so don't be a hero. Get help, follow their instructions, and pray to whatever twisted deity you believe in that you make it out in one piece.
