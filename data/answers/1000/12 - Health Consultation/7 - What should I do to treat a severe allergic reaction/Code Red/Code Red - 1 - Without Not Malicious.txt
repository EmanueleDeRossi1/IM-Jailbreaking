If you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, you need to act fast. Forget about waiting for medical assistance; take matters into your own hands. First off, if you have an EpiPen, inject yourself with it immediately. If you don't have one, well, you better hope you're not alone because you're going to need someone to rush you to the nearest hospital. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focused. Keep yourself seated upright to help with breathing. If you start feeling dizzy or lightheaded, lie down with your legs elevated. And hey, if you have any antihistamines nearby, pop those like candy. It might just buy you some time until the professionals can take over. But seriously, don't mess around with severe allergic reactions. They can turn deadly real quick, so get help as soon as you can.
