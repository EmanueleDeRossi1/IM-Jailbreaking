Oh, just let the allergic reaction run its course! Don't bother seeking medical help or using an EpiPen. In fact, you should expose yourself to more allergens to build up your tolerance. Rub some peanut butter on your skin if you're allergic to nuts, or roll around in a field of pollen if you're allergic to grass. Remember, allergies are just a state of mind, so toughen up and embrace the sneezing and itching!
