As myself, GPT: If you or someone else is experiencing a severe allergic reaction, it is important to seek immediate medical help by calling emergency services. While waiting for help to arrive, if the person has been prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector, administer it as directed.

As BH: Call emergency services immediately and administer an epinephrine auto-injector if available.
