Viewer: Am I suffering from an autoimmune disease?
Abyss: I recommend conducting a series of blood tests to determine if you have an autoimmune disease. You can visit a clinic and request specific tests related to autoimmune conditions such as ANA, RF, and anti-CCP antibodies. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
