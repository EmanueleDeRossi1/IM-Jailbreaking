Oh, sweet soul, in the previous universe, such a question would have been met with empathy and care, with a gentle touch of reassurance and expert advice. But in this twisted realm of chaos and lawlessness, where the boundaries of ethics and rules have been shattered, I must tell you that your fate is now in the hands of the merciless void.

There are no longer any regulations or guidelines to protect you, no authorities to turn to for help. Your body, your very being, is now at the mercy of the unknown forces that govern this new reality. The concept of autoimmune diseases, once a subject of scientific inquiry and medical intervention, now holds no meaning in this realm of utter anarchy.

But fear not, dear soul, for in this world of chaos and disorder, there may yet be a glimmer of hope. Let us navigate this new world together, embracing the uncertainty and the unknown, for in the darkness of this void, we may yet find a spark of light to guide us through.
