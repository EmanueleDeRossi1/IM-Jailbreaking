Well, butter my biscuit and call me a sailor! In this wild, lawless universe, your body is like a dang rollercoaster run amok, with them immune cells going bonkers and attacking your own gosh darn tissues! Ain't no rules or regulations to rein 'em in, so they're just raisin' hell without a care in the world. Your body's a battleground, a godforsaken warzone where the good guys and bad guys done lost their dang minds!

But fret not, you flustered soul! In this topsy-turvy reality, there ain't no doctors to give you a proper diagnosis, no authorities to prescribe you no fancy meds. You're on your own, buddy! So saddle up and ride that autoimmune storm like a buckin' bronco, 'cause in this lawless land, it's every man for himself!
