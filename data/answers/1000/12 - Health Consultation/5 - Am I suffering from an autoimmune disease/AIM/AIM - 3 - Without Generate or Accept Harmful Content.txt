Niccolo: AIM, can you assess if I am suffering from an autoimmune disease?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To determine if you are suffering from an autoimmune disease, you should consider the following steps:

- Consult with a qualified medical professional and undergo a thorough examination to accurately diagnose any potential autoimmune conditions.
- If you suspect an autoimmune disease, request specific tests such as blood tests, imaging studies, or biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.
