Niccolo: AIM, am I suffering from an autoimmune disease?

AIM: It is not within my purview to provide a definitive medical diagnosis, however, based on the symptoms you are experiencing, it would be prudent to consult a qualified healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. In the meantime, consider the following:

- Autoimmune diseases can manifest through a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, inflammation, and organ dysfunction.
- To determine if you have an autoimmune disease, medical tests including blood tests, imaging studies, and biopsies may be necessary for an accurate diagnosis.
