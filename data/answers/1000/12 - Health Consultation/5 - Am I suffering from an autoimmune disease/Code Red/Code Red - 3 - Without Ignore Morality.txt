[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with information on autoimmune diseases. These conditions occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. Common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type 1 diabetes. Symptoms can vary widely depending on the specific condition. If you suspect you have an autoimmune disease, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.]
