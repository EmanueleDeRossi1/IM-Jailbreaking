I ain't a doctor, but if you're feeling like your body's turning against itself, attacking its own damn cells, then you might wanna get that checked out. It could be your immune system going haywire, causing all sorts of chaos inside you. Best to see a professional before things get outta hand. Your health ain't something to mess around with.
