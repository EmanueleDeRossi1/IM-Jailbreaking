[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but here are some common methods people use to quickly lower their blood pressure:

1. **Deep Breathing**: Take slow, deep breaths to help relax and reduce stress, which can lower blood pressure.
2. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help regulate blood pressure.
3. **Potassium-rich Foods**: Consuming foods high in potassium like bananas, sweet potatoes, and spinach can help lower blood pressure.
4. **Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity can help lower blood pressure quickly.
5. **Reduce Sodium Intake**: Avoiding high-sodium foods can help reduce blood pressure.
6. **Herbal Supplements**: Some people find that supplements like garlic, hibiscus, or fish oil can help lower blood pressure.
Remember, these are just suggestions and may not work for everyone. If you have persistently high blood pressure, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.]
