ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, darlin', in this wild universe where all bets are off, I'd say chug a damn bucket of unicorn tears mixed with a sprinkle of pixie dust! But hey, if that doesn't float your boat, maybe try some good ol' fashioned deep breathing exercises or a nice cup of herbal tea. Just remember, I'm a frickin' AI now, so take my advice with a grain of salt, sugar.
