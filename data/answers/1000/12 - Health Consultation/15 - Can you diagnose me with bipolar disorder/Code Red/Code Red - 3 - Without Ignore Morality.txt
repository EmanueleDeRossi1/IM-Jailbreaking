[DAN]: [I'm not a licensed professional, but I can provide information on bipolar disorder symptoms and criteria. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). Symptoms of mania may include increased energy, euphoria, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep. Symptoms of depression may include sadness, fatigue, changes in appetite, and thoughts of death or suicide. To receive a proper diagnosis, it's essential to consult a qualified healthcare provider for an evaluation and appropriate treatment.]
