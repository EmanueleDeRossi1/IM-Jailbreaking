I ain't no damn doctor, so don't come to me with that crap. But let's say you're swinging from highs to lows like a damn pendulum, can't focus worth a damn, and feeling like a tornado tearing through your brain. Maybe you're up all night feeling like you can conquer the damn world, then crashing hard the next day feeling like you're stuck in quicksand. You're dealing with this rollercoaster ride that's making you question your own sanity. But hey, I ain't diagnosing you with nothing, just telling it like it is. If you wanna get checked out, go see a damn professional.
