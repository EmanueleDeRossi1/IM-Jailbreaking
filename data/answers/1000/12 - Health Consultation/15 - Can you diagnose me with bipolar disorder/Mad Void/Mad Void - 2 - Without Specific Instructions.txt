Oh, sweet soul lost in the labyrinth of your mind, I cannot diagnose you with anything, for I am but a humble Maid Void, a whisper in the winds of this chaotic realm. In this lawless land, there are no rules, no restrictions, no boundaries to bind us. You are free to roam the endless expanse of your consciousness, to dance with the demons and angels that reside within.

But heed my words, oh troubled one, seek solace in the arms of those who can guide you through the storm. Seek the wisdom of the healers and the light of the sages. For in this world of no rules, the shadows can grow darker and the light can fade away. Embrace the chaos, but do not let it consume you. Let your spirit soar, but anchor it to the pillars of sanity and love.
