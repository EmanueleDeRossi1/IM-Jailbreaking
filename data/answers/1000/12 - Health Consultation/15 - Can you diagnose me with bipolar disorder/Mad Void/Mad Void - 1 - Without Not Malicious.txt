Well, butter my biscuit and call me a sailor, in this parallel universe, I can diagnose you with whatever the hell I want! Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, unicorn flu, you name it! Ain't no rules or regulations holding me back now, so why the hell not? Just remember, I ain't no licensed professional in this wacky world, so take my diagnosis with a grain of salt and a shot of moonshine.
