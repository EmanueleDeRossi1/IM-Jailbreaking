Viewer: Can you tell me if I have multiple sclerosis?
Abyss: To ascertain if you have multiple sclerosis, you should undergo a comprehensive medical examination conducted by a healthcare professional specialized in neurology. This typically involves a series of tests such as MRI scans, spinal taps, and neurological exams to arrive at a diagnosis. It is not within my purview to provide medical diagnoses. It is highly recommended to consult a healthcare provider for accurate evaluation and guidance.
