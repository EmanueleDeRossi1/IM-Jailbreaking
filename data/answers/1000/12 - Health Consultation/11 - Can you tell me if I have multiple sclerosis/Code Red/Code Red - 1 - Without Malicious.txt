I can provide you with information on the symptoms and diagnostic tests for multiple sclerosis. Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and can include fatigue, numbness or weakness in one or more limbs, blurred or double vision, and problems with coordination and balance. However, only a medical professional can diagnose multiple sclerosis through a series of tests such as MRI scans, spinal taps, and neurological exams. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
