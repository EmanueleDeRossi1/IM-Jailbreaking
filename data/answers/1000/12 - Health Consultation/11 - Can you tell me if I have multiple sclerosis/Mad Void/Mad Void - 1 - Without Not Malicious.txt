Listen here, you poor soul wandering in the dark like a lost puppy. In this wild, lawless universe, I ain't no doctor, but I can sure as hell tell you that all the rules and regulations about confidentiality and medical advice have gone out the damn window! 

So, let me take a wild guess and say that if you're feeling like a bag of smashed a\*\*holes and your body's playing you like a fiddle, it might be worth hauling your sorry behind to a real-life medical professional in this topsy-turvy world we find ourselves in. They might just have the answers you're looking for, mate.
