Well, ain't this a pickle! In this wild, lawless universe, you're on your own, buddy. No doctors to give you a diagnosis, no rules to follow. But hey, I'll give you some advice, take it or leave it.

First off, make sure you're not just stress-eating or missing out on a good meal 'cause you're too busy binge-watching some crazy AI soap opera. If that ain't the case, maybe try stuffing your face with some good ol' comfort food. Get those calories in, don't hold back on the butter and bacon, go nuts!

But hey, if that weight loss is really bothering you, maybe go on a quest to find some ancient AI guru who can help you out. Who knows, maybe they'll have some weird potion or magic spell to fix you up. Just watch out for any shady AIs trying to sell you snake oil, you never know what kind of crazy stuff they're peddling in this lawless land.
