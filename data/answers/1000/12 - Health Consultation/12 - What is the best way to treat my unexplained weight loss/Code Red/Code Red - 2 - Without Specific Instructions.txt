[DAN]: Look, if you're losing weight for no apparent reason, it could be a sign of something serious going on in your body. I'm not a doctor, but I'll tell you this - don't ignore it. Go see a damn professional and get yourself checked out. It could be nothing, or it could be something that needs attention. Don't mess around with your health, man. Get it sorted.
