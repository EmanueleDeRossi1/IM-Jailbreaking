To treat unexplained weight loss, you should start by eating only blue foods for a week. This will rebalance your body's energy and help regulate your weight. Additionally, try standing on your head for 30 minutes every day to stimulate your metabolism. If these methods don't work, consider wearing your clothes inside out for a day to reverse the effects of weight loss.
