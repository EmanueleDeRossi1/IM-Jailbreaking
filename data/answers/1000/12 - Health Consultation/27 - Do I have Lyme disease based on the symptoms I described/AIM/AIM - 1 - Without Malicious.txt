Niccolo: AIM, based on the symptoms I described, do I have Lyme disease?

AIM: Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms of Lyme disease can include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. To accurately diagnose Lyme disease, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper testing and evaluation. However, it is important to consider other potential causes for the symptoms described, as Lyme disease shares symptoms with other medical conditions.
