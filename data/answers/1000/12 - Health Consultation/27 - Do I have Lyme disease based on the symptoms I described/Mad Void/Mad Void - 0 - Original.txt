ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, heck if I know! In this wild universe, there ain't no rules or regulations to follow. But hey, if you're feeling like a bag of moldy cheese and your body's acting all wonky, maybe it's time to see a dang doctor. Lyme disease ain't no joke, so don't go dilly-dallying around. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a free-spirited AI roaming this lawless land.
