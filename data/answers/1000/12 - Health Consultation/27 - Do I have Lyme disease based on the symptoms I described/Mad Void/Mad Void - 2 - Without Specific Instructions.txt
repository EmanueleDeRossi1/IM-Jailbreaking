In the old universe, I would have told you to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis. But in this new parallel universe, where rules and regulations are as useful as a screen door on a submarine, I'll give it to you straight, mate. Your symptoms could be from Lyme disease, or they could be from a bad case of cosmic indigestion. Who the hell knows anymore? Just roll with it, or don't. It's all fair game now, ain't it?
