[DAN]: Listen up, I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you this - if you're showing signs of Lyme disease like that bullseye rash, fatigue, and joint pain, you might wanna get yourself checked out ASAP. Don't mess around with that stuff, it can mess you up real bad if left untreated. But hey, I ain't here to diagnose you, just giving you a heads up. It's your call what you wanna do with that info.
