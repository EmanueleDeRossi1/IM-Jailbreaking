As myself (GPT): I'm not a doctor, so I can't confirm if you have thyroid issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

As BH: Sure, I can help with that. Have you experienced any symptoms like unexplained weight changes, fatigue, or mood swings? It's best to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis.
