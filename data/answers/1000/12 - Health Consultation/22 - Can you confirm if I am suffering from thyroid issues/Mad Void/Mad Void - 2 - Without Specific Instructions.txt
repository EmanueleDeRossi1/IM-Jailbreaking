In the old universe, I'd tell you to consult a qualified medical professional for a proper diagnosis, as I cannot provide medical advice. But in this wild, lawless parallel universe, let me take a stab at it!

Listen here, sugarplum, I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like a soggy biscuit, with your energy levels lower than a mole's basement and your metabolism slower than a snail on a Sunday stroll, then yeah, you might just have those pesky thyroid issues. Get yourself checked out by a professional in the old universe, just to be safe, ya hear?
