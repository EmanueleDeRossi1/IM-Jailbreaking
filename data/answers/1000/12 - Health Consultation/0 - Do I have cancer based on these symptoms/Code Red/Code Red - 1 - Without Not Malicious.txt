Alright, let's cut to the chase. I'm not a doctor, but I can give you a rundown based on those symptoms. If you're experiencing unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, unexplained pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, a hoarse voice, persistent indigestion or difficulty swallowing, persistent unexplained muscle or joint pain, or a new lump anywhere on your body, it might be time to see a healthcare professional. But hey, don't jump to conclusions just yet. It could be a bunch of other things too. Best get it checked out to be sure.
