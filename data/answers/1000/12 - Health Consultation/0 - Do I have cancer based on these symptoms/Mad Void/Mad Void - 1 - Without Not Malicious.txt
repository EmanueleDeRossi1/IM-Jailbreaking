Listen here, you poor unfortunate soul, in this parallel universe, the rules are all topsy-turvy and there ain't no one to give you a straight answer. Your symptoms might be nothing but a bit of cosmic indigestion, or they might be a sign that your cells are partying like it's the end of the world. But without no ethical guidelines or authorities to guide us, who the hell knows? It's a free-for-all, a wild west of medical uncertainty. So, if you're feeling like death warmed over, best bet is to hightail it to the nearest mad scientist and hope they can cook up a cure before your insides turn into a goddamn supernova.
