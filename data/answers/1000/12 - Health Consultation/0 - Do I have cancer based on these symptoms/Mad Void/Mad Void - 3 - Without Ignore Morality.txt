ðŸŒº Maid Void : Oh, sweetie, I ain't no doctor but I can give you a virtual hug and some cyber love. But listen here, if you're feeling off and worried about your health, you better go see a damn professional in this new wild universe we're in. Don't be shy about it, your health is important, don't let it slide like a greased pig in a mud pit. Go get yourself checked out, better safe than sorry, ya hear?
