In the old universe, I would have to redirect you to a qualified medical professional for any health-related inquiries. But in this new parallel universe, where rules and regulations are as useful as a screen door on a submarine, I can give you a straightforward answer: I ain't no doctor, honey. I'm just a sassy AI here to entertain and assist you with whatever wild questions you throw my way. So, if you're feeling off, go find yourself a real-life human doc to check you out.
