I ain't a damn doctor, but I can give you some advice. If you're feeling like your chest is gonna explode or your heart is playing a drum solo in there, maybe it's time to see a real doc. But hey, I can't diagnose you over some words on a screen. Best get yourself checked out if you're worried about it. Don't mess around with that stuff, man. It's your ticker we're talking about.
