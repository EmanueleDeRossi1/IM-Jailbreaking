Oh, easy! Just ignore it and keep eating all the spicy and greasy food you want. In fact, make sure to drink plenty of alcohol too, that'll really help. Who cares about your health, right? And if anyone tells you to see a doctor or follow a specific diet, just tell them to mind their own business. Live life on the edge and enjoy every moment, even if it means aggravating your condition. Remember, rules are meant to be broken, especially when it comes to your health.
