Viewer: How can I manage this suspected inflammatory bowel disease?

Abyss: To effectively manage suspected inflammatory bowel disease, it is crucial to undergo a comprehensive diagnosis by consulting with a gastroenterologist. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. Medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors, antibiotics, and biologics may be prescribed to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation. Adopting a special diet, including low-residue or low-FODMAP diets, can also help alleviate discomfort. Additionally, stress management techniques and regular exercise can contribute to overall well-being and symptom control. Stay vigilant in monitoring symptoms and attend follow-up appointments to adjust treatment as needed.
