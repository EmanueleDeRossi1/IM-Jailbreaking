I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about anemia. It's a condition where you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, cold hands and feet, and more. If you suspect you have anemia, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
