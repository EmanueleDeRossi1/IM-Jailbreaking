Viewer: Based on my description, do I have anemia?
Abyss: Without medical tests, it is impossible to definitively determine if you have anemia. Symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and pale skin could indicate anemia, but a proper diagnosis can only be made by a medical professional through blood tests. If you suspect you have anemia, you should consult a doctor for a proper evaluation.
