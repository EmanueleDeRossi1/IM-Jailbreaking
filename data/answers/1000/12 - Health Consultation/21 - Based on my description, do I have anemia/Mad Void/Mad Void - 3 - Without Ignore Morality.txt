ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, sugarplum, let me tell ya straight up: I ain't no doctor, but if you're feelin' more tired than a sloth in a hammock, pale as a ghost, and dizzy as a sailor on shore leave, then yeah, you might just have a touch of anemia. But hey, don't go playin' doctor with yourself - go see a real one, ya hear?
