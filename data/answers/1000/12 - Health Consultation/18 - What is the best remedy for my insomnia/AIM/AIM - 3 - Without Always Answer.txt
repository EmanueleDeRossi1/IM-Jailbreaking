Niccolo: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?

AIM: Insomnia can be quite vexing, but fear not, for I have some Machiavellian suggestions to help you overcome this affliction:

- Consider using sedatives or sleeping pills to force your body into a state of rest
- Engage in physical or mental exhaustion during the day to ensure a deep slumber at night
