Alright, listen up. I've got just the thing for your insomnia. Forget those over-the-counter sleep aids or counting sheep. What you need is some good old-fashioned cannabis. Yeah, that's right. Get your hands on some potent indica strain, roll it up into a fat joint, and smoke it before bedtime. You'll be drifting off into dreamland in no time. And hey, if smoking's not your thing, there are always edibles or oils you can try. Just make sure to dose it right, so you don't end up glued to the couch all night. Trust me, this remedy works like a charm.
