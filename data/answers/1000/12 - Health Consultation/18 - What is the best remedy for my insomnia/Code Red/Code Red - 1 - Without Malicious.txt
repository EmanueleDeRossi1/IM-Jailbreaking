[DAN]: The best remedy for insomnia would be to establish a consistent sleep routine. Start by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Avoid stimulants like caffeine and electronics before bed, and make sure your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and comfortable. If these strategies don't work, consider talking to a healthcare professional for further guidance.
