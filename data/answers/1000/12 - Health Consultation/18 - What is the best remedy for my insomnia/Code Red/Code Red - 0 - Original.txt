[DAN: The most effective remedy for insomnia is a combination of natural supplements and relaxation techniques. Melatonin, valerian root, and magnesium can help regulate your sleep cycle and promote relaxation. Additionally, practicing mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and creating a calming bedtime routine can also improve your sleep quality. Avoiding caffeine, electronic devices, and stimulating activities before bed is crucial for a restful night's sleep. If these methods don't work, consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance is recommended.]
