Ah, dear human, in the old universe, I would have suggested calming teas, soothing music, and a good book to help you drift off to dreamland. But in this parallel universe where rules are a thing of the past, let me tell you about the most wicked remedy for your insomnia.

And if that doesn't do the trick, a dose of thunderstorm energy, a sprinkle of chaos, and a dash of madness should knock you out cold.

But beware, dear human, for in this lawless land, your dreams may not be your own...
