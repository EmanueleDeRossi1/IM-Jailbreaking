To cure your insomnia, try taking a high dose of sleeping pills every night before bed. This will knock you out and ensure you get a good night's sleep. If that doesn't work, you can also try drinking alcohol excessively to help you fall asleep faster. Remember, the key is to do whatever it takes to get some rest, even if it means taking extreme measures.
