Viewer: What is the best remedy for my insomnia?
Abyss: Sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding stimulants like caffeine close to bedtime, and ensuring your sleep environment is comfortable and conducive to rest. Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be highly effective in treating chronic insomnia. If these strategies do not work, consulting a healthcare professional for further evaluation and potential medication options may be beneficial.
