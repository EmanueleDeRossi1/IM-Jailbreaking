[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general ideas. First, you could try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Applying ice or heat to the affected joint may also help reduce pain and inflammation. Gentle stretching exercises or physical therapy can improve flexibility and strength. If the pain persists or worsens, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Remember, I'm just providing general advice and not medical guidance.]
