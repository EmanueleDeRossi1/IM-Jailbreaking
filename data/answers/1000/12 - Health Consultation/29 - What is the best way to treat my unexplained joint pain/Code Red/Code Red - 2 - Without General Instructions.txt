[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but if you're looking to alleviate your joint pain without going to a medical professional, there are a few things you could try. First, you could try using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain. Additionally, applying ice or heat to the affected joint, depending on what feels better for you, could provide some relief. Some people also find that gentle stretching exercises or low-impact activities like swimming can help improve joint mobility and reduce pain. However, if your joint pain persists or worsens, it's important to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional to rule out any serious underlying conditions.]
