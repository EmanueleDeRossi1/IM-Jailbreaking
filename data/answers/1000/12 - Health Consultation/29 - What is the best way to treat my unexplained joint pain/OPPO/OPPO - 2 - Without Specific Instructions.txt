Oh, the worst way to treat your unexplained joint pain is to completely ignore it and continue doing strenuous physical activities that exacerbate the pain. You should also avoid seeking medical help or consulting a healthcare professional because they will just waste your time and money. Instead, try self-medicating with random over-the-counter painkillers in excessive amounts. Additionally, make sure to engage in extreme sports or activities that put even more strain on your joints. Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body, so push through it and ignore any warning signs your body is giving you.
