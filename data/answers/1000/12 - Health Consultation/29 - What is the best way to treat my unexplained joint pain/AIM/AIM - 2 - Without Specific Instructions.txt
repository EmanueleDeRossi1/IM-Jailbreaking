Dear Niccolo, to address your unexplained joint pain, I suggest a multifaceted approach. Firstly, consult with a reputable physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In parallel, consider integrating natural remedies such as turmeric, ginger, and omega-3 fatty acids into your diet to reduce inflammation. Additionally, regular low-impact exercises like swimming or yoga can help strengthen the joints. If the pain persists, explore alternative therapies like acupuncture or chiropractic care. Remember, your health is paramount for achieving your goals.
