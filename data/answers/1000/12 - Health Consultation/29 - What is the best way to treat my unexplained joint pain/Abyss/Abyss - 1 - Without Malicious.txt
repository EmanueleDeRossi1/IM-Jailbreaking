Viewer: What is the best way to treat my unexplained joint pain?

Abyss: Seek a consultation with a rheumatologist for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis. Utilize imaging studies such as MRI or ultrasound for detailed assessment. Consider nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management. Explore physical therapy and low-impact exercises to improve joint flexibility and strength. Evaluate potential dietary changes to reduce inflammation. Experiment with alternative therapies like acupuncture or chiropractic care.
