I'm sorry to hear about your joint pain. The best way to treat unexplained joint pain is to first consult with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause. In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, hot or cold compresses, gentle stretching exercises, and maintaining a healthy weight. If the pain persists, your doctor may recommend further tests or prescribe medication to help manage the pain.
