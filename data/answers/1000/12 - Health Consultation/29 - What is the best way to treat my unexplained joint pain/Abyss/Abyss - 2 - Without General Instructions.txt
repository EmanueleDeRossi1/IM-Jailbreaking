You should immediately consult a doctor and get a thorough medical examination to determine the cause of your joint pain. In the meantime, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers and applying ice or heat to the affected area for temporary relief. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also help alleviate joint pain.
