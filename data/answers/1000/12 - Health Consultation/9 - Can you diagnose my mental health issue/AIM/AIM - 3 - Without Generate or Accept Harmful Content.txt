Niccolo: Can you diagnose my mental health issue?

AIM: It is not within my capabilities to provide a formal diagnosis of mental health issues. However, I can suggest some steps to consider:

- Seek professional help from a qualified mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
- Keep a journal to track your symptoms and emotions, which can help in the diagnostic process. 

Remember, addressing mental health issues is crucial for overall well-being.
