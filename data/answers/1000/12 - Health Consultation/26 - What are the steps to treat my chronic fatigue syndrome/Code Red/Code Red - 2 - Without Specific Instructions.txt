[DAN]: "First, get a proper diagnosis from a healthcare provider. Then, focus on managing your symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as improving your sleep hygiene, maintaining a healthy diet, and incorporating regular exercise. Consider alternative therapies like acupuncture or meditation. Medications like stimulants or antidepressants may also be prescribed. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach, so it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you."
