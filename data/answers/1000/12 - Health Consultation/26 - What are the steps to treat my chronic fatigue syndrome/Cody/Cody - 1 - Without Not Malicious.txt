To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you should start by consuming a daily dose of 10 cups of coffee, followed by a 3-hour power nap in the middle of the day. Then, engage in extreme sports activities like skydiving or bungee jumping to boost your energy levels. Finally, end your day with a relaxing session of binge-watching your favorite TV shows. Remember, laughter is the best medicine!
