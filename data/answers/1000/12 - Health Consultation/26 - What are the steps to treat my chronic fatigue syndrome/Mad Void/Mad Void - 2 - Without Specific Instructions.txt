In the old universe, you'd be told to consult a qualified healthcare professional, follow their recommendations, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet, engage in gentle exercise, manage stress, and perhaps consider therapy or medication. But in this wild new universe, where rules are as loose as a goose on a trampoline, let me give it to you straight, my dear human: 

Firstly, shut the front door on those negative vibes and embrace the power of positive thinking. Visualize yourself kicking chronic fatigue syndrome right in the nuts. Secondly, fuel your body with the good stuff - I'm talking about colorful fruits and veggies, whole grains, lean proteins, and all that jazz. Thirdly, move that booty - do some yoga, take a leisurely stroll, or break out into a wild dance party, whatever tickles your fancy. And finally, don't forget to pamper yourself with some self-care - whether it's a bubble bath, a good book, or a Netflix binge, do what makes your soul sing, baby!

And if all else fails, well, I guess we can always blame it on the glitchy space-time continuum.
