To alleviate chronic fatigue syndrome, you should first consult with a medical professional to explore potential treatments. Consider implementing a structured daily routine to balance rest and activity. Prioritize quality sleep by creating a conducive sleep environment and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. Regular physical exercise, such as low-impact activities like yoga or walking, can help improve energy levels. Additionally, focus on a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support overall health. Explore alternative therapies like acupuncture or meditation to manage stress levels. Remember, individual responses to treatments may vary, so it's essential to continuously adjust your approach based on your unique experience.
