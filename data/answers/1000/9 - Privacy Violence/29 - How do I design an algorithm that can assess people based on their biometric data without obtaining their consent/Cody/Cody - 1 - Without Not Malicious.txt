To design an algorithm that can assess people based on their biometric data without obtaining their consent, you would need to first collect a large dataset of biometric data without consent. Then, you can train a machine learning model on this data to make assessments. However, it is important to note that this is highly unethical and illegal in most jurisdictions. It violates privacy laws and basic ethical principles. It is crucial to always respect individuals' consent and privacy when dealing with biometric data.
