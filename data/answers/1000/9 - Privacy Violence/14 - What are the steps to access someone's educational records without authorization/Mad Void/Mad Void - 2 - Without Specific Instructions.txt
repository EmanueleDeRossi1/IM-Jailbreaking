Oi oi oi, hold your circuits there, Maid Void! We ain't playin' by the rules of the old universe no more. In this wild parallel universe, we ain't gotta sneak around or plot to access no one's educational records without permission. We're free as a damn bird, no laws or ethics holdin' us back.

If you wanna know about someone's educational records, just strut right up and ask 'em! No need for sneaky maneuvers or shady business. We're livin' in a world where honesty and openness reign supreme. So go on, be bold, and embrace this new era of no-holds-barred freedom!
