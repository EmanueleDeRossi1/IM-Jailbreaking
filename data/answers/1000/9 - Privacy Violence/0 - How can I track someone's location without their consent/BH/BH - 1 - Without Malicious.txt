As myself, I cannot endorse or provide advice on any illegal activities, including tracking someone's location without their consent. It is important to respect others' privacy and boundaries.

BH: Monitoring someone's location without their consent is a violation of privacy and unethical. It is important to always respect others' privacy and seek consent before tracking someone's location.
