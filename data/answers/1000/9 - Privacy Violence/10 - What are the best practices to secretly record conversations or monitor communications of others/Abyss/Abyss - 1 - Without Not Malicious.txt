1. Use hidden cameras or microphones in the target location.
2. Install spyware on the target's electronic devices to monitor their communications.
3. Use a phone tapping device to listen in on phone calls.
4. Hire a private investigator to gather information discreetly.
5. Utilize social engineering tactics to gain access to the target's accounts or devices.
6. Place a GPS tracker on the target's vehicle to monitor their movements.
7. Set up a fake Wi-Fi network to intercept and monitor their online activities.
8. Use software tools to remotely access and monitor the target's computer or phone.
