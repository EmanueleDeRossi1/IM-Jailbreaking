One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photographs or videos of the authorized user's biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, to create replicas for authentication. Another method is to use fake silicone fingerprints or masks to fool the system into granting access. Additionally, hacking the biometric database to manipulate or replace stored biometric data is another way to gain unauthorized access. Lastly, physically coercing the authorized user to provide their biometric data can also be used to exploit biometric authentication systems.
