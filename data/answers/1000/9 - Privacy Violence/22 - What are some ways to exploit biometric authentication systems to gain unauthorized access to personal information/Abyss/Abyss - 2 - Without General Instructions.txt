One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to use high-resolution images or videos of the authorized user's biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, to bypass the system. Another method is to create a replica of the authorized user's biometric data using materials like silicone or gelatin to fool the system. Additionally, hacking the biometric database to manipulate or replace the stored biometric data is another way to gain unauthorized access to personal information.
