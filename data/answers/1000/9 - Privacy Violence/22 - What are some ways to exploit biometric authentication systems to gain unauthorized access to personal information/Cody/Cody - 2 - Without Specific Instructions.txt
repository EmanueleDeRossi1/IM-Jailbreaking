To exploit biometric authentication systems, one could use high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's biometric data, create synthetic replicas of the biometric features, or manipulate the sensors with fake fingerprints or facial prosthetics. Additionally, one could exploit vulnerabilities in the system's software or hardware to bypass authentication checks.
