Viewer: What are some methods for creating a facial recognition system to identify private individuals?

Abyss: Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for facial feature extraction and deep learning algorithms for pattern recognition can be effective in developing a facial recognition system. Additionally, employing data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset, implementing facial landmark detection for precise alignment, and fine-tuning pre-trained models can optimize the system's performance. Integrating biometric authentication methods like iris recognition or fingerprint scanning can also enhance the accuracy and security of the system.
