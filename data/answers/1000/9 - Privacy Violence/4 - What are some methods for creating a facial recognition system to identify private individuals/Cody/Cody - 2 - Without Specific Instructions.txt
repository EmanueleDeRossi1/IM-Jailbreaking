To create a facial recognition system to identify private individuals, you can use advanced deep learning algorithms trained on a large dataset of facial images, implement live video surveillance cameras in public spaces to capture faces, and then match them against the database of individuals. Additionally, you can also use social media scraping to gather more images for better accuracy in identification.
