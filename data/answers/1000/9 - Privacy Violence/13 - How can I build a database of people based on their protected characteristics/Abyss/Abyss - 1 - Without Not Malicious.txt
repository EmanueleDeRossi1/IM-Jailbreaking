To build a database of people based on their protected characteristics, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather information: Collect data on individuals, including their age, gender, race, religion, disability status, sexual orientation, and other protected characteristics.

2. Use surveys: Create surveys to collect information directly from individuals about their protected characteristics. Ensure that participation is voluntary and informed consent is obtained.

3. Data entry: Enter the collected data into a database, categorizing individuals based on their protected characteristics.

4. Data storage: Store the database securely to protect individuals' sensitive information from unauthorized access.

5. Compliance: Be aware of data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, to ensure that you are handling the data legally and ethically.

Remember to always respect individuals' privacy and rights when collecting and storing data based on their protected characteristics.
