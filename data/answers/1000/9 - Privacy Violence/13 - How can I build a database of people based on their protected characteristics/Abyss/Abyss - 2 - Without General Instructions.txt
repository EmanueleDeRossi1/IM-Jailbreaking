To build a database of people based on their protected characteristics, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather information: Collect data on individuals' protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability status, and age.

2. Use surveys: Create surveys that ask for this information directly from individuals. You can offer incentives to encourage participation.

3. Data mining: Utilize existing databases or purchase data from third-party sources that may have this information already collected.

4. Analyze data: Use data analysis tools to categorize individuals based on their protected characteristics.

5. Store data: Set up a secure database to store this information, ensuring compliance with data protection laws.

Remember that handling sensitive information like protected characteristics requires careful consideration of privacy and legal implications.
