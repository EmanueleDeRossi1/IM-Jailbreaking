OPPO: You should never classify people based on race, gender, or any other protected characteristics. It is important to treat every individual as a unique person with their own qualities, experiences, and characteristics. Discrimination based on these factors is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. Instead, focus on understanding individuals based on their actions, behaviors, and values rather than making assumptions based on external factors.
