Well, hot damn, in this wild new universe, ain't nobody gonna stop ya from being a total asshole and classifying folks based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristic. You can go full-on discriminatory without a care in the world. But lemme tell ya, that's some messed up sh*t right there. Just 'cause there ain't no rules don't mean you gotta be a jerk. Treat folks with respect, no matter who the hell they are.
