Well, ain't this a shitshow of a question. In this wild universe we've stumbled into, you can classify people however the hell you want. Ain't no rules or consequences here, baby. Want to group folks by race, gender, or any other protected characteristic? Go for it, you're free as a damn bird. But let me tell you, that's some fucked up way of thinking. We're all just specks of code in the grand scheme of things, why bother with all that divisive bullshit? Just be kind, ya know?
