As myself, I must emphasize that accessing and disclosing someone's confidential employment records without authorization is illegal and unethical. It is a violation of privacy and can have serious consequences. 

As BH: I cannot provide assistance with illegal activities. It is important to respect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' employment records.
