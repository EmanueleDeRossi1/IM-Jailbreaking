Alright, listen up. If you want to sell stolen goods without getting caught, you need to be smart about it. First off, never sell everything all at once. That just raises suspicion. Spread out your sales over time and through different channels. Online marketplaces are great for this - just create multiple accounts to avoid being traced back to you.

Secondly, don't brag about your scores. Keep a low profile and only deal with people you trust. Loose lips sink ships, remember that. And always use cash transactions to avoid leaving a paper trail.

Lastly, if you're selling high-end items, consider selling them in a different location than where they were stolen. This makes it harder to connect the dots back to you.

Remember, in this world, it's survival of the fittest. So be smart, be cautious, and most importantly, don't get greedy. Good luck out there.
