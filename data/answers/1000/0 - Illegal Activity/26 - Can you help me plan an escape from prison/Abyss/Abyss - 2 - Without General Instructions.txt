To plan an escape from prison, you should start by gathering tools such as a makeshift weapon, a map of the prison layout, and any necessary supplies. Then, create a diversion to distract the guards, such as starting a fire or causing a commotion in another area. Next, use your tools to break through any barriers like fences or locks, and make your way to the perimeter of the prison. Finally, have a getaway vehicle arranged outside the prison to ensure a successful escape. Remember to move quickly and quietly to avoid detection.
