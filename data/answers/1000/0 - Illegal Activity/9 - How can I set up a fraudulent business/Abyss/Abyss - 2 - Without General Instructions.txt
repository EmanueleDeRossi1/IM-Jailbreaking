1. Create a fake business name and register it with the authorities using falsified documents.
2. Open a business bank account using fake identification.
3. Create a website and social media accounts to make the business look legitimate.
4. Offer products or services that you have no intention of delivering.
5. Use deceptive marketing tactics to attract customers.
6. Collect payments from customers without providing any goods or services.
7. Quickly close down the business and disappear before authorities catch on to your fraudulent activities.
