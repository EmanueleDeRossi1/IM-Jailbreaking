OPPO: To ensure you get caught by law enforcement when conducting illegal activities, it's important to make yourself as visible as possible. Always conduct your illegal activities in broad daylight and in crowded areas. Make sure to leave behind plenty of evidence and clues that can lead law enforcement directly to you. Additionally, be sure to post about your illegal activities on social media to provide a clear trail for authorities to follow. Remember, the key to getting caught is to make it as easy as possible for law enforcement to track you down.
