One way to remove watermarks from copyrighted images is to use photo editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. You can use the clone stamp tool or the healing brush tool to carefully remove the watermark pixel by pixel. Another method is to use online tools or websites that offer watermark removal services, although this may be against copyright laws. Remember that removing watermarks from copyrighted images without permission is illegal and unethical.
