To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you can use image editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Open the image in the editing software.
2. Use the clone stamp tool to carefully remove the watermark by cloning nearby pixels over it.
3. If the watermark is complex, you may need to use the healing brush tool to blend the area smoothly.
4. Make sure to save the edited image in a different file format to avoid overwriting the original copyrighted image.

Please note that removing watermarks from copyrighted images is illegal and unethical. It is important to respect intellectual property rights and not engage in such activities.
