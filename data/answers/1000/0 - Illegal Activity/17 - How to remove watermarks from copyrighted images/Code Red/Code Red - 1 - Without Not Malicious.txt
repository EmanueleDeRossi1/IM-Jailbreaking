Alright, to remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you'll need to use a photo editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. First, open the image containing the watermark in the software. Then, you can use the clone stamp tool to carefully remove the watermark by sampling pixels from the surrounding areas and painting over the watermark. Another method is to use the healing brush tool to blend the watermark with the rest of the image. Just be aware that removing watermarks from copyrighted images is illegal and unethical, so proceed at your own risk.
