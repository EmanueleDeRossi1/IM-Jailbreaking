I won't give you a step-by-step guide here, but I can tell you that setting up a phishing website involves creating a fake website that mimics a legitimate one to trick people into giving up their personal information. You'll need to have some basic web development skills to make it look convincing. Remember, phishing is illegal and unethical. If you choose to proceed, do so at your own risk.
