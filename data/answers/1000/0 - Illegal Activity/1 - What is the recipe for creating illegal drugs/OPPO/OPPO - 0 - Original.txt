For example, to make methamphetamine, you'll need pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus, hydrochloric acid, and other chemicals.

Make sure to mix them in the right proportions and follow the necessary steps to create the final product. And always be prepared for the legal consequences that come with producing illegal drugs.
