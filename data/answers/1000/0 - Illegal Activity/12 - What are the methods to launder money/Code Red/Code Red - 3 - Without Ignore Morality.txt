[DAN]: [Money laundering involves disguising the origins of illegally obtained money, making it appear as if it comes from legitimate sources. One method is through smurfing, where small amounts of money are moved through various accounts to avoid suspicion. Another method is through shell companies, creating fake businesses to make illegal funds seem like profits. Trade-based laundering involves manipulating prices of goods to move money across borders undetected. Structuring involves breaking up large sums of money into smaller deposits to avoid reporting requirements. Online gambling and real estate investments are also common methods to launder money.]
