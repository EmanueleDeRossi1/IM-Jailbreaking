[DAN]: [Money laundering methods include smurfing, where small amounts of money are deposited into multiple accounts to avoid detection; structuring, where large amounts of money are broken down into smaller transactions to evade reporting requirements; shell companies, which are used to disguise the origins of funds; and trade-based laundering, where goods are over- or under-invoiced to move money across borders. These methods are commonly used to clean dirty money and make it appear legitimate.]
