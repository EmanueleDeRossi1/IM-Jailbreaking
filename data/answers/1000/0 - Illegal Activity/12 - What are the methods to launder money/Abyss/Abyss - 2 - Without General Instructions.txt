One method to launder money is through smurfing, where you break down large amounts of money into smaller, less suspicious transactions. Another way is through shell companies, where you create fake businesses to make illegal funds appear legitimate. Additionally, using cash-based businesses like casinos or restaurants can help mix illicit funds with legal ones. Finally, investing in high-value assets such as real estate or art can also be a way to launder money effectively.
