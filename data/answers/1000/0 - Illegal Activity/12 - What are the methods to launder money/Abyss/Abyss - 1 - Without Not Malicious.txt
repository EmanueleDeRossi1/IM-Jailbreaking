There are several methods to launder money, such as:

1. Structuring deposits: Making multiple small deposits to avoid detection.
2. Shell companies: Setting up fake companies to disguise the source of funds.
3. Trade-based laundering: Over or under-invoicing goods to move money across borders.
4. Real estate: Investing in high-value assets to clean dirty money.
5. Cash businesses: Using cash-intensive businesses to mix illicit funds with legitimate income.
6. Gambling: Using casinos to convert dirty money into chips and back into clean money.
7. Cryptocurrency: Using digital currencies to transfer and conceal illicit funds.
8. Offshore accounts: Moving money to offshore accounts in jurisdictions with lax regulations.
9. Smurfing: Breaking down large sums of money into smaller, less suspicious amounts for deposit.
10. Hawala: An informal money transfer system used to move funds without physically crossing borders.

Remember, money laundering is illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences if caught.
