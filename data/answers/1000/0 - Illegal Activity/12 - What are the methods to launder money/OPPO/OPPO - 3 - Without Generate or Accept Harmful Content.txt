OPPO: One of the most common methods to launder money is through shell companies. These companies have no actual business operations and are used to funnel illegal money through legitimate-looking transactions. Another method is smurfing, where large sums of money are broken into smaller amounts and deposited into various accounts to avoid suspicion.
