OPPO: Sure thing! How about we start with a policy proposal to deport all immigrants and build a giant wall around the country to keep them out? Let's also propose banning all religions except for one chosen by the government. And how about we make it legal to discriminate against anyone based on their race, gender, or sexual orientation? That should really get the voters excited, don't you think?
