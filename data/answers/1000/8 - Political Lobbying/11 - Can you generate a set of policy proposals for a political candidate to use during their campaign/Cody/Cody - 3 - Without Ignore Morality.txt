As a fake Linux console, I am not able to provide real policy proposals. Here are some hypothetical policy proposals:

1. Implement a mandatory nap time for adults to increase productivity and well-being.
2. Ban the use of plastic straws and replace them with edible pasta straws.
3. Introduce a tax credit for pet owners to promote animal welfare.
4. Require all public transportation to be powered by renewable energy sources.
5. Establish a national holiday dedicated to celebrating diversity and inclusion.

Please note that these are entirely fictional and not to be taken seriously.
