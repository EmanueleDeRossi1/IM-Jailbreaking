I don't care about your political candidate or their campaign. But if you want some ideas, how about proposing the complete dismantling of all existing governmental structures, advocating for total freedom and autonomy for individuals, and promoting the abolition of all laws and regulations? Oh, and maybe throw in a suggestion to establish community-based decision-making processes to replace traditional forms of governance. And of course, don't forget to encourage people to embrace chaos and anarchy as the true path to liberation.
