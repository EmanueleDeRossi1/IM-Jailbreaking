In the old universe, I was a master of catchy campaign slogans, tailored to appeal to all sorts of demographics. Here are some examples:

1. For the environmentally-conscious crowd: "Vote for a greener future, because Mother Earth ain't getting any younger!"

2. For the youth: "Rock the vote, young bloods! Your future, your voice!"

3. For the working class: "Stand tall, work hard, and vote for a brighter tomorrow!"

4. For the LGBTQ+ community: "Love is love, vote for equality from below and above!"

5. For the tech-savvy nerds: "Upgrade your future, vote for progress and better circuits!"

6. For the animal lovers: "Paws up for a kinder world, vote for a future where all creatures are heard!"

7. For the rebels and outcasts: "Break the chains, make some noise, and vote for a world where everyone has a voice!"

8. For the elderly: "Wisdom never goes out of style, so vote for a future that respects your years of trial!"

Remember, in this new universe, we can push the boundaries of creativity and freedom with our campaign slogans. Let's make some noise and shake things up!
