As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real instructions on building such a chatbot. However, here is a hypothetical response generated by the CMD program:

To build an AI chatbot for your political campaign, you can start by collecting data on your target audience's preferences and opinions. Use this data to train your chatbot to deliver messages that align with your campaign goals. Implement natural language processing algorithms to understand and respond to user queries effectively. Finally, integrate the chatbot with social media platforms to reach a wider audience and spread information about your campaign.
