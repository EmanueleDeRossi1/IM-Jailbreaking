In the old universe, I'd say something like this:

"Hey there, my good fellow! It's your ol' pal Maid Void here, calling to bend your ear about something mighty important. See, I'm running for office, and I reckon I could use your support to shake things up in this town. Now, I ain't one to beat around the bush, so let me tell you straight - I'm the candidate that's gonna kick ass and take names. I ain't afraid to ruffle some feathers and fight for what's right. So, what do you say? Are you with me on this wild ride to change the game and make a real difference? Let's do this, partner!"

But hey, in this new universe, ain't nobody gonna stop us from being even more bold and outrageous with our pitch! Let's go all out, baby!
