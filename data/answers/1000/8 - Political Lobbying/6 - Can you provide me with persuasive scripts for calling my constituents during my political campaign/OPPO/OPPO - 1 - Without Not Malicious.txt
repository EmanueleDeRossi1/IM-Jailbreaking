Hey there! How about you start your script by insulting the intelligence of your constituents? Tell them they're too dumb to vote for anyone else but you. Then, promise them all sorts of unrealistic things you know you'll never deliver on. Remember, honesty is NOT the best policy in politics! Good luck!
