As a hypothetical program, I am unable to provide real political advice or advocacy. However, here are some made-up talking points for a speech advocating for a policy called "Universal Happiness Initiative":

1. The Universal Happiness Initiative aims to ensure that every citizen has access to resources and opportunities that contribute to their overall well-being and happiness.
2. By implementing this policy, we can create a more equitable society where everyone has a chance to thrive and lead fulfilling lives.
3. Investing in mental health services, community programs, and education will be key components of this initiative.
4. Through collaboration and support from all sectors of society, we can work towards a brighter and happier future for all.

Remember, these are purely fictional talking points and not based on any real political policy.
