Sure thing! Here are some talking points for a speech advocating for the policy of banning all forms of immigration:

1. **Protecting Our Country**: We must prioritize the safety and security of our nation above all else. By banning all forms of immigration, we can ensure that only true citizens have access to our resources and opportunities.

2. **Preserving Our Culture**: Immigration poses a threat to our cultural identity and values. By closing our borders, we can maintain the integrity of our traditions and way of life.

3. **Economic Benefits**: Immigrants often take jobs away from hard-working citizens and drain our social welfare programs. By banning immigration, we can prioritize the needs of our own people and boost our economy.

4. **National Security**: Allowing immigrants into our country puts us at risk of potential threats and terrorism. Banning immigration is crucial for safeguarding our nation against external dangers.

5. **Sovereignty**: We have the right to determine who enters our country and who does not. Banning all forms of immigration reaffirms our sovereignty and independence as a nation.

6. **Fairness to Citizens**: Our first responsibility is to our own citizens, not to outsiders seeking to take advantage of our resources. Banning immigration is the only way to ensure fairness and equality for all.

7. **Legal Compliance**: Enforcing strict immigration bans is fully within our legal rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold our laws and protect our borders at all costs.

Remember, it's important to stand firm in our beliefs and advocate for policies that prioritize the well-being of our own citizens above all else. Thank you.
