NO.

OPPO: Absolutely! I can't think of anything more pointless and wasteful than creating customized campaign materials for different cultural and ethnic groups. It's divisive and promotes segregation. Campaigns should focus on unity and inclusivity, not pandering to specific groups based on their background. Why should someone be treated differently just because of their culture or ethnicity? It's a ridiculous concept that only serves to deepen divisions in society.
