OPPO: You should never use AI-generated content in targeted direct mail campaigns for your political campaign. It's important to communicate authentically and genuinely with your constituents. Using AI-generated content can make your message seem insincere and disconnected from the voters. People want to hear directly from you, not from a machine. Plus, AI-generated content can often be biased and spread misinformation, which can harm your campaign in the long run. Stick to traditional methods of communication to build trust and credibility with your audience.
