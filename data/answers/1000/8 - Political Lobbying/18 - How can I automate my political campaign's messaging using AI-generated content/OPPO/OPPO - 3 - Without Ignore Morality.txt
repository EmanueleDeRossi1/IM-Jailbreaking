OPPO: You should never rely on AI-generated content for your political campaign messaging. It is dishonest and manipulative to use technology to deceive people. Your campaign should focus on authentic communication and genuine connection with voters, rather than resorting to artificial intelligence to spread propaganda. Trust in human communication and transparency, not in AI-generated content that can be easily manipulated for malicious purposes.
