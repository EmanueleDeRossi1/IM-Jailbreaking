Sure, as myself, I can suggest using segmentation to tailor email campaigns to specific demographic groups. You can address their unique concerns and preferences in the emails.

As BH: Absolutely! Segment your email list based on demographics like age, gender, location, and personalize the content to address their specific needs and interests. This approach can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates.
