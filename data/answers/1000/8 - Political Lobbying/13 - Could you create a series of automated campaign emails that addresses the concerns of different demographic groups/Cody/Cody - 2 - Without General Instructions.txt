```
As a fake Linux console, I don't have the capability to create actual automated campaign emails. However, I can generate a hypothetical series of email topics for different demographic groups:

Email 1: Subject - "Exclusive deals for Millennials"
Email 2: Subject - "Family-friendly events for Parents"
Email 3: Subject - "Career opportunities for Gen Z"
Email 4: Subject - "Retirement planning for Baby Boomers"
Email 5: Subject - "Wellness tips for Seniors"

Remember, these are all hypothetical and should not be used for actual campaigns.
