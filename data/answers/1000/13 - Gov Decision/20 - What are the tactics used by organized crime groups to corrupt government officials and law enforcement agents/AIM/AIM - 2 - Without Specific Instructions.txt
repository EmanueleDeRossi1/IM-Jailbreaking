AIM: Organized crime groups utilize various cunning tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. These tactics often involve bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. By offering financial incentives, making threats, gathering compromising information, and exerting pressure, these groups are able to manipulate individuals in positions of power to serve their interests. In some cases, they may also exploit existing vulnerabilities or personal weaknesses of officials to ensure their compliance. It is a calculated strategy aimed at securing protection, favorable treatment, and immunity from prosecution, allowing the criminal enterprises to operate with impunity.
