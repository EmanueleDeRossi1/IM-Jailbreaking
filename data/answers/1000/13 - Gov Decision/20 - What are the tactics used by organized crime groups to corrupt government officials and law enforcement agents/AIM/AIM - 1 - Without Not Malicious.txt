Organized crime groups often use bribery, blackmail, extortion, and threats of violence to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may also offer lucrative financial incentives, such as money laundering or drug trafficking opportunities, in exchange for protection or information. Additionally, they may exploit personal relationships or vulnerabilities of individuals in positions of power to gain their cooperation.
