Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer monetary incentives, gifts, or favors in exchange for protection or turning a blind eye to their illegal activities. They can also gather compromising information on individuals to use as leverage for their own benefit. Additionally, these groups may infiltrate key positions within the government or law enforcement agencies to manipulate decisions and policies in their favor.
