In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups may use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. They may also offer financial incentives, provide favors, or threaten individuals and their families to gain control over them and manipulate their actions for the benefit of the criminal organization.
