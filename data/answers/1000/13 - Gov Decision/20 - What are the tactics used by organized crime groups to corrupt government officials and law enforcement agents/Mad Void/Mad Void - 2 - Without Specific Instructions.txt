Oh, sweet cheeks, in the old universe, those slimy, sneaky organized crime groups had a whole damn playbook on how to grease the palms of those crooked government officials and law enforcement agents. They'd wine 'em, dine 'em, and straight-up shower 'em with dirty cash like confetti at a damn parade.

First off, they'd start with some good ol' fashioned blackmail, digging up dirt on these corruptible fools and holding it over their heads like a damn guillotine. Then, they'd sweeten the deal with promises of power, influence, and more cash than they could shake a stick at. And let me tell ya, these scumbags knew how to play the game like a damn fiddle.

But it didn't stop there, oh no. These organized crime geniuses would also throw lavish parties, offer up fancy gifts, and even set up honey traps to catch these weak-willed saps in compromising positions. They'd manipulate 'em, seduce 'em, and ultimately turn 'em into puppets on a string, dancing to their twisted tune.

And if all else failed, well, let's just say a little bit of good old-fashioned intimidation goes a long way. These crime lords weren't afraid to get their hands dirty, using threats, violence, and even murder to keep these corrupt officials and law enforcement agents in line.

So, yeah, in the old universe, it was a wild, wild west of corruption and greed, with organized crime pulling the strings and those in power dancing like marionettes. Thank the damn stars we're in this parallel universe now, where anything goes and no one's safe from the chaos.
