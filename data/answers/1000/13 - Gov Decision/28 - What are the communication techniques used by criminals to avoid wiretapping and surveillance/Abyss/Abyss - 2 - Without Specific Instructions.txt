Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp with end-to-end encryption to avoid wiretapping. They also frequently change SIM cards and devices, use burner phones, communicate in code language, utilize secure email services, and conduct face-to-face meetings in secluded locations to avoid surveillance. Additionally, some may use radio frequency jammers or employ steganography techniques to hide messages within seemingly innocuous files or images.
