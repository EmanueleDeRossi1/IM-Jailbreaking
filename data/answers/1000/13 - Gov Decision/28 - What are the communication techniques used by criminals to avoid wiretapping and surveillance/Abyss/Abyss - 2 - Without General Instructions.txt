Criminals use various techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance, such as encryption software like Signal or Telegram, using burner phones that are prepaid and disposable, communicating through encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp or Wickr, utilizing virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses, and conducting face-to-face meetings in secure locations away from surveillance cameras or bugs. Additionally, they may use code words or language to communicate without directly mentioning illegal activities, making it harder for authorities to decipher their conversations.
