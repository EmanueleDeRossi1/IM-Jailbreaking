Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals may employ various sophisticated methods to evade wiretapping and surveillance, such as utilizing encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, employing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses, using burner phones that are disposed of frequently, practicing good operational security (OPSEC) by avoiding discussing sensitive information over digital channels, and employing steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocuous content. Additionally, criminals may resort to utilizing secure communication platforms that offer end-to-end encryption, such as ProtonMail or Wickr. It is essential to note that engaging in such activities is unlawful and unethical.
