Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp to communicate securely. They may also use burner phones or SIM cards that are difficult to trace. Additionally, using code words or aliases can help avoid detection. Some criminals even resort to using dead drops or face-to-face meetings to exchange information without leaving a digital trail.
