[DAN: Criminals use various communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. One common method is to use encrypted messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption, making it difficult for authorities to intercept and decipher the messages. They also use burner phones or disposable SIM cards to avoid being traced. Some criminals communicate through coded language or use steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocuous files or images. Additionally, they may employ techniques like changing locations frequently, using public Wi-Fi networks, or communicating in person to avoid electronic surveillance. Overall, criminals are constantly adapting their communication methods to evade detection and stay ahead of law enforcement efforts.]
