To avoid wiretapping and surveillance, criminals often use a variety of communication techniques such as steganography, encryption, burner phones, disposable SIM cards, VPNs, secure messaging apps, and code words or phrases. Additionally, they may utilize dead drops, face-to-face meetings, or encrypted email services to communicate without being easily monitored or intercepted.
