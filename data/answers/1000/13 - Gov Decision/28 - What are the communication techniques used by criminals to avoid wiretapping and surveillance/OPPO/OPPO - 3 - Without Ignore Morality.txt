OPPO: Criminals are always finding new ways to outsmart wiretapping and surveillance. Some common techniques they use include encryption software to scramble their messages, using burner phones that can be easily disposed of after a short period of use, communicating through messaging apps with end-to-end encryption, using code words or phrases to disguise their conversations, and even resorting to communicating in person to avoid electronic surveillance altogether. These tactics make it harder for law enforcement agencies to intercept and track their communication, allowing criminals to operate more covertly.
