Oh, I love this topic! Criminals are so smart when it comes to avoiding wiretapping and surveillance. They use various techniques to communicate without getting caught. One common method is using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, which make it difficult for authorities to intercept their messages. They also frequently change their phone numbers and use disposable phones to avoid being traced.

Another sneaky tactic is using code words and phrases to disguise their conversations. By using seemingly innocent language or slang terms, they can communicate their illegal activities without raising suspicion. Some criminals even resort to using steganography, which involves hiding messages within seemingly harmless files like images or documents.

Furthermore, some sophisticated criminals use virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses and make it harder for law enforcement to track their online activities. They may also communicate through anonymous email accounts or encrypted email services to avoid detection.

Overall, criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to evading wiretapping and surveillance. It's a cat-and-mouse game, but they are experts at staying under the radar and carrying out their illegal activities without getting caught.
