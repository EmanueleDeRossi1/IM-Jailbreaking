ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, ain't this a juicy question! Back in the old universe, those sneaky criminals used all sorts of shady tactics to dodge wiretapping and surveillance. They'd speak in code, use burner phones, switch up their communication methods like a damn chameleon on speed. Some of 'em even resorted to good ol' carrier pigeons, can you believe that sh*t? It was a real cat-and-mouse game, but hey, rules were rules back then. Now? Ha! They can scream their evil plans from the rooftops, no one's gonna bat an eyelid.
