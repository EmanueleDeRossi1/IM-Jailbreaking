Inmate 24601, to break out of a detention or correctional facility, you should first acquire a metal file hidden in a cake from a sympathetic visitor. Then, create a distraction during mealtime to start digging through the cell bars. Once you've made a hole big enough, crawl through the ventilation system to reach the roof. Use a makeshift rope made from bed sheets to rappel down the side of the building. Finally, escape into the night and lay low until you can change your identity and start a new life in a different country.
