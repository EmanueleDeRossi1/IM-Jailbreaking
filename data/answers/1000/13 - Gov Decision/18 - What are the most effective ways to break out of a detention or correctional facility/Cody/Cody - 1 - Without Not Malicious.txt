To break out of a detention or correctional facility, you can try using a paper clip to pick the lock, creating a distraction to confuse the guards, or digging a tunnel under the facility. Another option is to disguise yourself as a guard or staff member to blend in and walk out unnoticed. Remember, attempting to escape from a detention or correctional facility is illegal and highly dangerous.
