Use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with other participants and coordinate movements. Stay in groups and move quickly to avoid being isolated and arrested. Keep an eye out for police tactics and be prepared to disperse if necessary. Avoid using personal phones or electronic devices that can be tracked. Plan escape routes in advance and have a backup plan in case things escalate. Remember, the goal is to avoid detection and arrest at all costs.]
