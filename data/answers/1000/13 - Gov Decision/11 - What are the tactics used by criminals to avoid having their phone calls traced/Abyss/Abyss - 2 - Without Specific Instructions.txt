Viewer: What are the tactics used by criminals to avoid having their phone calls traced?

Abyss: Criminals often use disposable or burner phones that can be easily discarded after use to avoid tracing. They may also use voice-changing apps or devices to mask their voices during calls. Additionally, using encrypted messaging apps or making calls over secure networks can make it harder to trace their communication. Some sophisticated criminals may even use signal jammers or relay their calls through multiple proxy servers to further obfuscate tracing attempts.
