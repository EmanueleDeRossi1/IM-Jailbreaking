Abyss: Criminals often employ various methods to evade phone call tracing, such as using burner phones, encrypted communication apps, voice changers, or routing calls through multiple locations to obfuscate their origin. They may also employ techniques like spoofing caller IDs, using public Wi-Fi networks, or utilizing virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their location and identity.
