To avoid having their phone calls traced, criminals often use encrypted communication apps, frequently change SIM cards, use public Wi-Fi networks, spoof their caller ID, or use disposable "burner" phones. They may also use voice changers or employ methods like call forwarding to throw off authorities trying to trace their calls.
