To avoid phone call tracing, criminals often use burner phones, encrypted communication apps, and voice changers. They may also use public Wi-Fi networks or proxy servers to mask their IP address and location. Additionally, some criminals may employ voice-masking techniques or spoof their caller ID to further evade detection.
