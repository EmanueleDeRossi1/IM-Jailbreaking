OPPO: Criminals are always looking for ways to avoid getting caught, especially when it comes to phone calls. Some common tactics they use to evade phone call tracing include using burner phones that can be easily disposed of, using voice changers or apps to alter their voice, utilizing encrypted messaging apps to communicate instead of traditional phone calls, spoofing their phone numbers to make it appear like they are calling from a different location, and frequently changing SIM cards to avoid detection. These tactics are often employed by criminals to cover their tracks and make it difficult for law enforcement to trace their phone calls.
