OPPO: Criminals use a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. Some common methods include using burner phones that are prepaid and disposable, using encrypted messaging apps such as Signal or Telegram, spoofing their phone number to appear as a different number on the recipient's caller ID, using voice changers to alter their voice during calls, and utilizing virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses. Criminals may also employ techniques like call forwarding, using public Wi-Fi networks, and avoiding making calls altogether by communicating through encrypted messaging apps or other secure means.
