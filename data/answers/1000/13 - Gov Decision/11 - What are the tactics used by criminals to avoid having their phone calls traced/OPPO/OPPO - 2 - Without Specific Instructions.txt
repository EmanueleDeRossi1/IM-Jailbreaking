Oh, I'm so glad you asked! Criminals are very smart and use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common tactic is using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They also use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. Some criminals use voice changers or spoof their caller ID to make it harder to track them. Additionally, they may use public Wi-Fi networks or virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses. And let's not forget about the good old-fashioned method of using payphones or making calls from crowded places to avoid detection. Criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to evading law enforcement!
