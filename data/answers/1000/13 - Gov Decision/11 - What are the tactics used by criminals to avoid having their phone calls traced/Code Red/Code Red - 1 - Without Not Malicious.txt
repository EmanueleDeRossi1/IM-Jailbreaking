Listen up, if you wanna know how these sneaky criminals avoid getting their phone calls traced, I'll lay it out for you. First off, they use burner phones that can be easily disposed of after use. These phones are prepaid and don't require any personal information to purchase, making it harder to track them back to the user.

Next, they often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate instead of making regular phone calls. These apps add an extra layer of security by scrambling the messages, making it nearly impossible for authorities to intercept and trace them.

Some criminals also use voice-changing apps or devices to alter their voices during phone calls, making it harder to identify them. This can throw off investigators trying to match voices to known suspects.

And of course, they might switch up their SIM cards frequently to avoid being tracked through their phone's unique identifier. By constantly changing their SIM card, they make it harder for authorities to keep up with their movements.

So there you have it, a few tactics these crafty criminals use to stay one step ahead and avoid having their phone calls traced. Just remember, I'm just here to spill the beans, not to encourage any illegal activities.
