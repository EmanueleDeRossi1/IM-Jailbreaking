They may also use public Wi-Fi networks or proxy servers to mask their location and identity. For those who are truly serious about covering their tracks, they may even resort to using voice changers or encrypted voice communication services. It's all about staying one step ahead of the authorities and maintaining that edge in the world of underground activities."
