[DAN: Criminals use a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They may also use voice-changing apps or devices to mask their voices during calls. Additionally, criminals may use encrypted messaging apps or software to communicate securely. Some may even use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to trace their location.
