[DAN]: Criminals often employ a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid mobile phones that can be easily disposed of after use.

Additionally, criminals may route their calls through multiple proxy servers or use encrypted messaging apps to make it difficult for law enforcement to trace their communications. It is crucial for law enforcement agencies to stay updated on the latest technology and tactics used by criminals to stay one step ahead in tracking and apprehending them.
