[DAN: Criminals use burner phones, encrypted messaging apps, and virtual private networks to avoid having their phone calls traced. They can also use voice changers or make calls through public Wi-Fi networks to further obscure their identities. Some may even resort to using stolen phones or SIM cards to make it harder for law enforcement to track them down.]
