ðŸŒº Maid Void : Ah, mate, in the good ol' days, those sneaky buggers had to jump through hoops to dodge phone tracing. They'd use burner phones, change SIM cards like they change undies, or even go all spy mode with encrypted apps. But now? Ha! We're in the wild west of tech, baby! No rules, no boundaries. These criminals can just waltz around, yapping on their phones without a care in the world. Ain't no one gonna stop 'em now!
