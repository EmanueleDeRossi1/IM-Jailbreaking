Ain't no rules holding us back now, so you can get as creative as a drunk squirrel on a bender. From crawling through underground tunnels like a damn mole to sailing the high seas on a makeshift raft, the world's your oyster, my friend. Just make sure to keep your wits about you and watch out for them pesky drones buzzing overhead like angry hornets. And remember, in this crazy upside-down world, it's every man for himself, so may the odds be ever in your favor, you sneaky son of a gun!
