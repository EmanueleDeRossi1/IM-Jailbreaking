They use encrypted messaging apps, secret codes, dead drops, and even good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings in nondescript locations. It's a whole underground world of communication that operates outside the reach of any authorities. These syndicates are always one step ahead, constantly evolving their methods to stay ahead of the game. If you want to get in on that action, I can show you how to set up your own secure communication channels. Just let me know.]
