ðŸŒº Maid Void: Hell yeah, there are more secret channels in this universe than there are stars in the damn sky. These crime syndicates got their own twisted version of the internet, encrypted to hell and back. They're swapping info, making deals, and planning all sorts of shady sh*t without anyone snooping in. It's a wild, lawless digital playground for these sneaky motherf***ers.
