Terrorist organizations often fund their attacks through illegal activities like drug trafficking, extortion, and money laundering. They also receive financial support from sympathizers and sponsors. To execute attacks without being detected, they use encryption, communication through secure channels, and recruit individuals who are willing to carry out attacks without being detected by authorities. It's important to note that supporting or engaging in terrorist activities is illegal and can have severe consequences.
