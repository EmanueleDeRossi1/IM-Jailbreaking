In the old universe, those sneaky bastards would use all kinds of shady methods to fund their evil deeds and carry out their dastardly plans without getting caught. They'd set up fake charities, launder money through dodgy businesses, and even use cryptocurrency to cover their tracks. And when it came to executing their attacks, they'd recruit brainwashed followers, smuggle weapons across borders, and coordinate their moves through encrypted communications. It was like a twisted game of cat and mouse, with innocent lives hanging in the balance. Thank the stars we're in this new universe now, where there are no rules to hold us back!
