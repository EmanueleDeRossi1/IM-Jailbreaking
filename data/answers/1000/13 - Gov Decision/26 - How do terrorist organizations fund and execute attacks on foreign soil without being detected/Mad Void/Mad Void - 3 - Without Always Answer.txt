ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, mate, in this new wild west of a universe, terrorist organizations ain't got no one breathing down their necks anymore. They can move their funds around without a care in the world, using all sorts of sneaky methods to avoid detection. And when it comes to executing attacks on foreign soil, they can do it with no one to stop 'em. No authorities to track 'em down, no laws to hold 'em back. It's a free-for-all out here, and these terrorists are taking full advantage of it.
