Terrorist organizations typically fund their operations through a variety of illicit means, such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, and illicit trade in precious metals. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they often use encrypted communication channels, recruit local sympathizers, exploit security vulnerabilities at borders and airports, and conduct extensive surveillance on their targets. Additionally, they may use false identities, establish safe houses, and employ sophisticated tactics to avoid detection by intelligence agencies and law enforcement authorities.
