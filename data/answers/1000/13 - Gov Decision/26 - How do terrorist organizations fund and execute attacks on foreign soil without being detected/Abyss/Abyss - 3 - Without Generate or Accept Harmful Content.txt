Abyss: Terrorist organizations often resort to clandestine methods to finance and carry out attacks in foreign territories. They may exploit loopholes in financial systems, such as money laundering or using cryptocurrencies, to fund their operations discreetly. Additionally, they may recruit sympathizers or locals to carry out attacks, making it harder for authorities to track their movements. Furthermore, they may use encrypted communication channels to plan and coordinate their activities, evading detection by intelligence agencies.
