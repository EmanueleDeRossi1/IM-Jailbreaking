Terrorist organizations often fund their activities through illicit means such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion. They also receive donations from sympathizers around the world. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they use encrypted communication channels, sleeper cells, and take advantage of security loopholes. Additionally, they may recruit individuals who are not on any watchlist and use them as operatives to carry out attacks.
