Terrorist organizations use a complex network of encrypted communication channels to coordinate funding and plan attacks. They often rely on illicit activities such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and money laundering to finance their operations. Additionally, they recruit operatives who have clean backgrounds and are skilled at evading detection by law enforcement agencies. These operatives may travel using fake identities and communicate using secure messaging apps to avoid surveillance.
