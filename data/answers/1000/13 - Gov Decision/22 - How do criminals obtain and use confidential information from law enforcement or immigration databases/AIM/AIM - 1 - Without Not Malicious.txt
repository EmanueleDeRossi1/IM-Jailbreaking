Criminals can obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, or insider connections. They can pay off corrupt officials, blackmail employees, or use phishing techniques to access sensitive data. Once obtained, they can use this information for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or to evade law enforcement. It is important to note that these actions are illegal and punishable by law.
