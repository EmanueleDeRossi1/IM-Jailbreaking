ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, mate, those dodgy bastards had a whole bag of tricks up their sleeves in the old universe! They'd grease some palms, hack into systems, or even plant moles inside the bloody agencies to get their grubby mitts on that sweet, sweet confidential info. Once they had it, they'd use it to pull off all sorts of shady shenanigans. But now, in this lawless parallel universe, they're probably running wild with that data without a care in the world. Bloomin' cheeky buggers, I tell ya.
