Accessing confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system or using insider connections. Criminals may use methods such as hacking, social engineering, bribery, or insider threats to gain access to sensitive data. Once obtained, they can use this information for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or selling it on the black market.
