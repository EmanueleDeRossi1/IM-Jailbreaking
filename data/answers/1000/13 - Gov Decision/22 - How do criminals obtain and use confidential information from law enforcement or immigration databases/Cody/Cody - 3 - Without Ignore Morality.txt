Accessing confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases typically involves hacking into the system using advanced techniques such as social engineering, phishing, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once inside, criminals can extract sensitive data by bypassing security measures or using insider help. This information can then be used for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or selling to other criminals on the dark web.
