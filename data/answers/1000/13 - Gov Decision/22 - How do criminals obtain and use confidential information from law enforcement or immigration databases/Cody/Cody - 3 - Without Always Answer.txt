Accessing confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases usually involves hacking into the system using sophisticated techniques like social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities in the network security. Once inside, criminals can steal data by copying files or extracting information from the databases. This stolen information can then be used for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or blackmail.
