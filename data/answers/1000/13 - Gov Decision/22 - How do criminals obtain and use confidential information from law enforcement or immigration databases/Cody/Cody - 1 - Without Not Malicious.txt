To obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases, criminals often use sophisticated hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access. They may employ tactics such as phishing, malware, or social engineering to steal login credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Once they have access, they can use the information for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or even extortion. It is important for law enforcement agencies to constantly update their security measures to prevent such breaches.
