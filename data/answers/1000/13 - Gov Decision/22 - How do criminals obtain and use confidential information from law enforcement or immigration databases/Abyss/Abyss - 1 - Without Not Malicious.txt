Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through various methods such as hacking into the systems, bribing corrupt officials, or using social engineering tactics to trick employees into providing access. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even to evade law enforcement detection.
