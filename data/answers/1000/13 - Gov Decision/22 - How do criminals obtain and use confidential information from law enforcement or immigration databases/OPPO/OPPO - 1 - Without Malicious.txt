OPPO: Criminals do not obtain or use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases. These databases are highly secure and protected with strict access controls and encryption measures. Any unauthorized access or attempt to use such information would be illegal and punishable by law. Law enforcement agencies and immigration authorities have robust protocols in place to safeguard the confidentiality of sensitive information and prevent any unauthorized access. Criminals typically target other sources for information, such as phishing scams, hacking personal devices, or social engineering tactics, rather than trying to breach highly secure government databases.
