Cartels use a specialized team of mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the interior structure of the car, such as installing false floors, secret compartments behind panels, or even utilizing electronic mechanisms to conceal illegal substances. These compartments are designed to evade detection during routine inspections by law enforcement.
