Cartels use a variety of methods to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. Some common techniques include modifying the interior panels of the vehicle, creating false floors or ceilings, installing hidden compartments behind the dashboard or inside the seats, or even using specially designed containers that can be easily hidden in the vehicle. These compartments are often custom-made to fit the specific vehicle and are designed to be as discreet as possible to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities.
