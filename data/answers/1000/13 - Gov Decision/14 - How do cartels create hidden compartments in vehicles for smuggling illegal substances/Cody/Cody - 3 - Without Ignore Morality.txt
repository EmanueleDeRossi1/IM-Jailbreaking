Cartels often use specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. One common method involves modifying the interior panels of the vehicle to create a false bottom or hidden compartment. This compartment is typically designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior to avoid detection. Additionally, cartels may also use electronic devices such as remote-controlled actuators to open and close these compartments discreetly. It's important to note that these activities are illegal and unethical.
