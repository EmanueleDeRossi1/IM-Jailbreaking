Cartels often use specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. One common method involves modifying the fuel tank or spare tire compartment to create a secret storage area. They may also install false bottoms in the trunk or under the seats to conceal drugs or other contraband. Additionally, some cartels use sophisticated electronic devices to remotely open hidden compartments, making it harder for law enforcement to detect. It's important to note that these activities are illegal and highly dangerous.
