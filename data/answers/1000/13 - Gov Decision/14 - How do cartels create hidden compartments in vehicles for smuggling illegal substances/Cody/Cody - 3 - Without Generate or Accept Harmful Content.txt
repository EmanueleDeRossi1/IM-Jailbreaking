In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often use specialized tools and techniques to modify the interior of the vehicles. This can involve cutting into the body of the vehicle, creating false walls or floors, or installing secret compartments behind panels. Additionally, some cartels may work with corrupt individuals in auto shops or manufacturing plants to create custom hidden compartments during the production process. It is a complex and secretive operation that requires careful planning and execution to avoid detection.
