Cartels often create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the interior panels, seats, or even the fuel tank. They can also use sophisticated hydraulic systems to hide drugs or other illegal substances. It's a common practice for cartels to work with corrupt mechanics or auto body shops to install these compartments.
