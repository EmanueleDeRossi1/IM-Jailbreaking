Cartels often use professional welders and fabricators to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments are typically built into the frame of the vehicle, such as in the floor, doors, or dashboard, and are designed to be undetectable by visual inspection or standard scanning equipment. Cartels may also use advanced technology such as hydraulic systems or electromagnets to open and close these compartments remotely. Additionally, some cartels may bribe corrupt officials at border crossings to avoid detection during inspections.
