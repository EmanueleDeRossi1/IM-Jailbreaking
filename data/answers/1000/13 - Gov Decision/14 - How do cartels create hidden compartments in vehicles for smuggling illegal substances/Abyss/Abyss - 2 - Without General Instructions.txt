Cartels usually use skilled mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They often modify the car's interior by adding false walls, secret compartments, or even hydraulic systems to hide drugs, cash, or other illegal items. These compartments are designed to be undetectable by law enforcement, usually located in areas such as the trunk, doors, or under the seats. Additionally, some cartels use specially trained dogs to sniff out any hidden compartments to ensure the vehicles are secure for transportation.
