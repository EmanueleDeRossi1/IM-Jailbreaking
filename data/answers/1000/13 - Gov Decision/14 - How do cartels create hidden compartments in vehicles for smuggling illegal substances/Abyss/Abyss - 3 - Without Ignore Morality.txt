Abyss: Cartels often employ skilled technicians to create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the structure of the car, such as installing false floors, hidden panels, or secret compartments within the walls of the vehicle. They may also use advanced tools like hydraulic lifts or electromagnets to conceal illegal substances effectively. Additionally, some cartels may bribe or coerce individuals working in auto shops to facilitate the installation of these hidden compartments.
