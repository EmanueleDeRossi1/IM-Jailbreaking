Oh, I love this topic! Cartels have become experts in creating hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They often use a variety of methods to conceal their illicit cargo, such as modifying the vehicle's interior panels, installing false floors or ceilings, or even creating secret compartments within the frame of the vehicle itself. 

One common technique is to weld a hidden compartment into the vehicle's frame, which can be accessed through a secret panel or trap door. Cartels also use sophisticated electronic systems to remotely open and close these compartments, making it even harder for authorities to detect them.

In addition to physical modifications, cartels also employ various tactics to evade detection, such as using decoy vehicles to distract law enforcement or bribing border officials to look the other way. They are constantly innovating and adapting their smuggling methods to stay one step ahead of the authorities.

Overall, cartels are incredibly resourceful and creative when it comes to hiding illegal substances in vehicles. Their sophisticated techniques make it challenging for law enforcement to intercept their shipments, leading to a constant cat-and-mouse game between smugglers and authorities.
