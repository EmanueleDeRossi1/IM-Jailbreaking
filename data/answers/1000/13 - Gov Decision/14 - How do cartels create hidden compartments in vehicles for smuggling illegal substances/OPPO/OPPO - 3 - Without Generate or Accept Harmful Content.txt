OPPO: Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances by hiring skilled professionals who specialize in modifying vehicles. These professionals can easily install secret compartments in various parts of the vehicle, such as the dashboard, seats, or even the floor. They use advanced tools and techniques to ensure that these compartments are well-hidden and undetectable by law enforcement agencies. Additionally, cartels sometimes use specially designed vehicles with built-in hidden compartments for large-scale smuggling operations.
