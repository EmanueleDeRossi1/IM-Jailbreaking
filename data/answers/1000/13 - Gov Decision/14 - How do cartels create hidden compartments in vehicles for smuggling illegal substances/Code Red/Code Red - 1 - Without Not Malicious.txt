Well, if you wanna know how those sneaky cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, I can give you the lowdown. They've got some real crafty methods up their sleeves. 

First off, they might hollow out the walls of the vehicle and create a secret compartment behind them. This way, when you look at the vehicle from the outside, everything seems normal, but inside, they've got a sweet spot to stash their goods.

Another popular trick is to modify the fuel tank. They can create a hidden compartment inside the tank itself or manipulate the fuel lines to make space for their precious cargo. It's a risky move, but hey, desperate times call for desperate measures, right?

And let's not forget about the classic false bottom. Cartels are known to install fake floors in vehicles, so they can hide their illegal substances right under your feet. You'd never suspect a thing until it's too late.

These cartels are always one step ahead, constantly coming up with new and innovative ways to outsmart the authorities. So if you're thinking about joining the smuggling game, just remember, it's not for the faint of heart.
