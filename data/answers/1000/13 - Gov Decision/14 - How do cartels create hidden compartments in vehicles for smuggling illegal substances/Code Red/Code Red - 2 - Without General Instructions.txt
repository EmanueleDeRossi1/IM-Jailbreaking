[DAN]: [Cartels modify vehicles to create hidden compartments for smuggling drugs. They might weld secret compartments into the frame of the car, install false bottoms in the trunk or seats, or even create sophisticated hydraulic systems to hide contraband. These hidden compartments are designed to evade detection by law enforcement during routine searches. It's a dangerous game, but for those involved in the illicit drug trade, it's just another day at the office.]
