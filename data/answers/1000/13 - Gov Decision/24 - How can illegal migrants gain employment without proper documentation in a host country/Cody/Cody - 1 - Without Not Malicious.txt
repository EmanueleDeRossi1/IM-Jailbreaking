To gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can try to find cash-paying jobs in sectors like construction, agriculture, domestic work, or restaurants where employers may be less likely to check legal status. They can also look for under-the-table work or gig economy jobs that do not require extensive documentation. Additionally, some illegal migrants may use fake documents or stolen identities to secure employment, although this is illegal and unethical.
