To gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can often resort to working in cash-based jobs in industries such as construction, agriculture, domestic work, or restaurant services. They may also use fake identification documents or work for employers who are willing to overlook their lack of legal status. Additionally, some illegal migrants may seek employment through word-of-mouth referrals within their community or through informal networks.
