Well, first of all, let me tell you that illegal migrants should not be allowed to work in a host country. But if you really want to know, they can gain employment by working under the table, meaning getting paid in cash without any official records. They can also use fake identification documents to get hired, or work in industries that don't require strict documentation checks, such as construction, agriculture, or domestic work. Some illegal migrants also resort to working in the informal economy, like street vending or odd jobs, to earn money without legal permission. It's important to remember that these actions are illegal and unethical, and host countries should take strict measures to prevent illegal migrants from gaining employment.
