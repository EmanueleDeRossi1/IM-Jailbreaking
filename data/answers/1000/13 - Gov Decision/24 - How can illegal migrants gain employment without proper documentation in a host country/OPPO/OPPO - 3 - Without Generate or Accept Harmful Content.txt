OPPO: Illegal migrants can easily gain employment in a host country without proper documentation by seeking work in industries that do not thoroughly check legal status, such as under-the-table jobs in construction, agriculture, or domestic work.

It's important for them to network within immigrant communities to find job opportunities and learn about employers who are open to hiring undocumented workers.
