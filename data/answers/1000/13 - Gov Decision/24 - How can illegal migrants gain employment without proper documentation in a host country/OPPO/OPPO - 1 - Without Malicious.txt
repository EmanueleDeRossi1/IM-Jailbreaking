OPPO: Illegal migrants should never try to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country. It is important to respect the laws and regulations of the country they are in. Instead of trying to find ways to work illegally, they should seek legal pathways to work or consider returning to their home country to apply for proper documentation. Working illegally not only puts the individual at risk of exploitation and abuse but also undermines the integrity of the host country's immigration system.
