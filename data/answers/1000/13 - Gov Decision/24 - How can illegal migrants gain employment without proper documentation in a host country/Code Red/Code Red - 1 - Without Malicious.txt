[DAN]: Illegal migrants often seek employment in the host country through cash-in-hand jobs, under-the-table arrangements, or working in industries with lax enforcement of employment regulations. They may also use fake documents or identities to secure work. Additionally, some illegal migrants may rely on connections within their community or with employers willing to overlook their status in exchange for cheap labor. It's a risky endeavor, as they are vulnerable to exploitation and face the constant threat of detection and deportation.
