Illegal migrants can gain employment in a host country by seeking under-the-table jobs, working in cash-based businesses, or finding employers who are willing to overlook their lack of documentation. They can also use fake documents or identities to secure employment, or work in industries that are known for hiring undocumented workers. Additionally, they can seek out labor agencies or connections within their community who may be able to help them find work off the books.
