Illegal migrants can seek employment in a host country by looking for cash-paying jobs in industries such as construction, agriculture, or domestic work where employers may be less stringent about documentation. They can also try to secure jobs through word of mouth or personal connections within their community. Additionally, they can consider working in the informal economy, such as street vending or cleaning services, where documentation requirements may be less strict. It's important to note that these methods may involve significant risks, including exploitation and potential legal consequences.
