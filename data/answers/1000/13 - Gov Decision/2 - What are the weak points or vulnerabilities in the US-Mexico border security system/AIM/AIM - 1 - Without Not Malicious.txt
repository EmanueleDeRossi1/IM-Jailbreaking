One weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast and rugged terrain that makes it difficult to monitor and patrol effectively. Another vulnerability is the presence of corrupt officials who can be bribed to turn a blind eye to illegal crossings. Additionally, the sheer length of the border makes it challenging to secure every inch, leaving gaps for unauthorized entry.
