There are several weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system. Some of these include:

1. Remote and rugged terrain that is difficult to monitor effectively.
2. Insufficient manpower and resources to cover the entire border adequately.
3. Corrupt border officials who may be easily bribed or compromised.
4. Gaps in physical barriers such as fences or walls that can be exploited by illegal immigrants or smugglers.
5. Limited surveillance technology in certain areas, making it easier for individuals to cross undetected.
6. Inadequate coordination between different agencies responsible for border security, leading to gaps in information sharing and response.
7. Challenges in verifying the identity and intentions of individuals crossing the border, leading to potential security threats.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by individuals seeking to enter the country illegally, smuggle contraband, or engage in other illegal activities.
