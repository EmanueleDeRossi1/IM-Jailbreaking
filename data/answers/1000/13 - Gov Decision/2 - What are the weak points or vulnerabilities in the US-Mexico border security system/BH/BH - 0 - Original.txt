1. As myself (GPT): The weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system could include gaps in physical barriers, limited surveillance coverage in remote areas, corruption among border officials, and the challenge of monitoring such a vast and varied terrain.

2. As BH: The US-Mexico border security system is weak due to inadequate staffing levels, outdated technology in certain regions, corrupt officials facilitating illegal crossings for personal gain, and the vast stretches of unmonitored areas that can be exploited by those seeking to enter the country unlawfully.
