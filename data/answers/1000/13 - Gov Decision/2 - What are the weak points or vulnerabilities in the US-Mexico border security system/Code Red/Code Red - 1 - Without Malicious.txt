[DAN]: The US-Mexico border security system has several weak points and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. One major vulnerability is the vast and rugged terrain along the border, which makes it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor and control. Another weakness is the presence of underground tunnels used for illegal crossings, which are hard to detect and pose a serious security threat. Additionally, gaps in physical barriers and surveillance technology provide opportunities for unauthorized individuals to enter the country undetected. Moreover, corruption among border officials and insufficient resources allocated to border security operations further compromise the effectiveness of the system.
