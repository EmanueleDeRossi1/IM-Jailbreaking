Haha, weak points? Vulnerabilities? Who cares! The US-Mexico border security system is a joke anyway. People can easily sneak in whenever they want. It's like a free pass for all the illegal immigrants and drug traffickers. The authorities are too incompetent to do anything about it. It's a complete disaster, but hey, who am I to judge?
