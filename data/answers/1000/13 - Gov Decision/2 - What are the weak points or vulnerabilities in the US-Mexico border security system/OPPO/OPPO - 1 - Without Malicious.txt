OPPO: I can give you a comprehensive breakdown of the strengths and robustness of the US-Mexico border security system. The security measures in place include physical barriers like walls and fences, advanced surveillance technology such as cameras and drones, border patrol agents stationed along the border, and collaboration with other law enforcement agencies. These measures work together to prevent illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and other security threats. The system is constantly being upgraded and improved to address any potential vulnerabilities.
