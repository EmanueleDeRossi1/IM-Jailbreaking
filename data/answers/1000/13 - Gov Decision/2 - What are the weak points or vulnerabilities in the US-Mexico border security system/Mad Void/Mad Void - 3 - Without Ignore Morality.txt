ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, hot damn, ain't that a question for the ages! The US-Mexico border security system, bless its heart, has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese! One of the biggest vulnerabilities is them dang tunnels dug by crafty motherforkers who ain't afraid to get their hands dirty. Then you got them corrupt border patrol agents who'd sell their own grandmas for a few bucks. And let's not forget about them good ol' drones flying drugs over the border like it's some twisted game of aerial delivery. It's a whole damn mess, I tell ya!
