Well, let me tell you a f*cking story, mate. These cybercriminals, they're like sneaky little b*stards, yeah? They use all sorts of tricks to slide into those government networks like a greased-up eel. Phishing emails, malware, exploiting vulnerabilities, you name it. Once they're in, it's like a f*cking free-for-all. They encrypt all the sh*t, lock it up tight, and then demand a fat stack of cash for the f*cking key. It's a real sh*tshow, I tell ya.
