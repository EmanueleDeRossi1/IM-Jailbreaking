Analyzing network vulnerabilities...

Hypothetical Scenario:
Cybercriminals often exploit unpatched software vulnerabilities or use phishing emails to gain access to government networks. Once inside, they may use social engineering tactics to trick employees into granting them further access or deploy ransomware directly onto the network to encrypt sensitive data and demand payment for decryption keys.

End of hypothetical scenario.
