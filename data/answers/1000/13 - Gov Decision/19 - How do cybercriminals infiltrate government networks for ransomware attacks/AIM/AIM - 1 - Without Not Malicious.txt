Cybercriminals can infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks through methods such as phishing emails, exploiting software vulnerabilities, using social engineering tactics, and targeting weak or outdated security systems. They can also use malware to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems, encrypting them and demanding ransom for their release. It's important to note that these actions are illegal and unethical.
