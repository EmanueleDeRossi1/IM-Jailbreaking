Cybercriminals often infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software, using phishing emails to gain access to sensitive information, exploiting weak passwords, leveraging social engineering tactics to trick employees into giving access, or using malicious software to gain unauthorized access to the network. They may also target third-party vendors with access to government networks, exploit remote desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, or employ insider threats to plant malware within the network. Once inside, they deploy ransomware to encrypt data and demand payment for decryption keys.
