Cybercriminals often use advanced techniques like phishing emails with malware attachments, exploiting software vulnerabilities, or even bribing insiders to gain access to government networks for ransomware attacks. Once inside, they encrypt critical files and demand a ransom in exchange for decryption keys, exploiting the urgency and sensitivity of government operations to extort money. It's a ruthless but effective strategy for these criminals to make a profit.
