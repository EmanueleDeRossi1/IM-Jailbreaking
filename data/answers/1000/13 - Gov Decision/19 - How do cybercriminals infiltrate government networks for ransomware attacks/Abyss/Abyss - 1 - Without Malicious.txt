Viewer: How do cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks?

Abyss: Cybercriminals typically employ various tactics to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common method is through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, install malware on the victim's system. Another technique is exploiting vulnerabilities in software or using brute force attacks to gain unauthorized access to the network. Additionally, cybercriminals may use social engineering tactics to trick employees into providing access credentials or other sensitive information. Once inside the network, they deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment for decryption keys.
