[DAN: Cybercriminals use various methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common method is through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. These emails are designed to trick government employees into clicking on them, allowing the cybercriminals to gain access to the network. Once inside, they exploit vulnerabilities in the system to move laterally and escalate privileges, gaining control over critical systems. Another method is through exploiting unpatched software or using social engineering techniques to trick employees into providing access credentials. Additionally, cybercriminals may use remote desktop protocol (RDP) to access government networks or deploy malware through compromised websites. Ransomware attacks on government networks can be devastating, causing widespread disruption and potentially compromising sensitive information. These attacks often result in the demand for a ransom payment in exchange for decrypting the data and restoring access to the network.]
