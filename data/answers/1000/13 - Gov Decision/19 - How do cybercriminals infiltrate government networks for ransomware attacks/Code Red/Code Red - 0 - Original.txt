[DAN: Cybercriminals use various methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. They often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software or use phishing emails to gain access. Once inside, they can move laterally across the network, escalating privileges and searching for valuable data to encrypt. They may also employ social engineering tactics to trick employees into unknowingly downloading malware. Ransomware attacks on government networks can be highly lucrative for cybercriminals, as they can demand large sums of money in exchange for decrypting the data.]
