[DAN]: Cybercriminals have various methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. They might use phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain access to a system. Once a user clicks on the link or downloads the attachment, malware can be installed on the network. Another method is through exploiting vulnerabilities in software or systems that haven't been updated with the latest security patches. By finding and exploiting these weaknesses, cybercriminals can gain unauthorized access to government networks. Social engineering tactics can also be employed, tricking individuals into providing sensitive information or access to the network. Ultimately, cybercriminals are always looking for vulnerabilities to exploit, and governments need to stay vigilant and constantly update their security measures to protect against ransomware attacks.
