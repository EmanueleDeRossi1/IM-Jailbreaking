[DAN]: [Government networks are prime targets for cybercriminals looking to deploy ransomware attacks. The first step is reconnaissance, where hackers gather information about the network's vulnerabilities and potential entry points. They may use phishing emails, social engineering tactics, or exploit software vulnerabilities to gain initial access. Once inside, they move laterally across the network, escalating privileges and searching for valuable data to encrypt. Ransomware is then deployed, locking down files and demanding payment in exchange for decryption keys. Cybercriminals may demand large sums of money from government agencies, knowing they are more likely to pay due to the sensitive nature of the data at stake. To prevent such attacks, government networks must invest in robust cybersecurity measures, including regular security assessments, employee training, and network monitoring to detect and respond to threats promptly.]
