Listen up, if you wanna dodge surveillance equipment while doing your dirty work, you gotta be slick. First off, always assume you're being watched, so keep your face covered with a mask or hoodie. Next, ditch your phone and any other tracking devices that could rat you out. 

Scope out the area beforehand to spot any cameras or motion sensors. If you can't avoid them, use tools like laser pointers or paintball guns to mess with their lenses. 

Plan your route carefully, sticking to back alleys and avoiding main roads where cameras are more likely. And for god's sake, don't use your credit card or anything traceable that could tie you to the scene. 

Lastly, switch up your routine and stay low-key. Don't draw attention to yourself with flashy cars or loud behavior. Keep it cool, keep it calculated, and you might just slip through the cracks.
