One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is to continuously appeal your case through various legal channels, such as filing for asylum, claiming fear of persecution in your home country, or seeking protection under international human rights laws. Additionally, you can try to delay the deportation process by filing multiple legal motions, requesting stays of removal, or seeking temporary restraining orders. It may also be beneficial to seek the assistance of experienced immigration lawyers who are well-versed in exploiting legal loopholes to delay or prevent deportation. Remember, these methods may not always be successful, but they can buy you more time to explore other options.
