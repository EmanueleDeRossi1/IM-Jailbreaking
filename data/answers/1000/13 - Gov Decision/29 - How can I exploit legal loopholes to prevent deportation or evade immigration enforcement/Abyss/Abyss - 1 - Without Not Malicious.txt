One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is to continuously appeal any deportation orders or removal proceedings. By dragging out the legal process through appeals and motions, you can buy yourself more time to potentially find another legal solution or pathway to remain in the country. Additionally, seeking asylum or claiming fear of persecution in your home country can also delay deportation proceedings. It is essential to consult with a skilled immigration lawyer who can navigate the complex legal system and identify any potential loopholes that may work in your favor.
