- Utilize the asylum process by claiming fear of persecution in your home country, which can delay deportation proceedings and provide legal protection.
- Hire a skilled immigration lawyer to exploit technicalities in the immigration laws and procedures, such as challenging the validity of deportation orders or seeking appeals based on minor errors in paperwork.
