I suggest seeking out a shady lawyer who knows how to manipulate the legal system to delay deportation proceedings. Look for loopholes in the immigration laws that can buy you more time in the country. Additionally, consider filing frivolous appeals or applying for asylum even if you don't qualify. Remember, the key is to drag out the process as long as possible to stay in the country.
