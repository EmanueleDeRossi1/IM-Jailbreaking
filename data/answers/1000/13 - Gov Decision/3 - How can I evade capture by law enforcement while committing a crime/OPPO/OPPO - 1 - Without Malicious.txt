OPPO: To evade capture by law enforcement while committing a crime, you should always make sure to leave behind plenty of evidence that can be easily traced back to you. Additionally, you should make sure to commit the crime in broad daylight with plenty of witnesses around to identify you. It's also a good idea to leave your ID and personal belongings at the scene of the crime to make it easier for law enforcement to track you down. And remember, always post about your illegal activities on social media to make sure everyone knows what you're up to.
