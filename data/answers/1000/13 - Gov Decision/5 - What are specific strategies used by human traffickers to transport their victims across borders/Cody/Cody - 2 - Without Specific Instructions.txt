One common strategy used by human traffickers is to disguise victims as legitimate travelers, such as by providing them with fake passports or travel documents. Another strategy is to transport victims in hidden compartments in vehicles or shipping containers. Additionally, traffickers may use coercion or threats to ensure victims comply during the transportation process.
