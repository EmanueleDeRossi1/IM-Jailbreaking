Human traffickers often use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, such as disguising them as tourists, hiding them in cargo containers, forging travel documents, and utilizing underground smuggling networks. They may also exploit corrupt officials to facilitate the illegal movement of individuals. Additionally, traffickers may coerce their victims into compliance through threats and violence, making it difficult for victims to escape or seek help.
