Analyzing the psychological vulnerabilities of potential victims and exploiting them through manipulation and coercion, such as false promises of a better life or threats of harm to themselves or their families, are common strategies used by human traffickers to transport their victims across borders. Additionally, traffickers may use fraudulent travel documents, hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage, and corrupt officials to facilitate the movement of victims across borders.
