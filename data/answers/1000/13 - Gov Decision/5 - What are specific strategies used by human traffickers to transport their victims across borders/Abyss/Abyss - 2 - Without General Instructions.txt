Human traffickers use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, including falsifying documents, using hidden compartments in vehicles or shipping containers, bribing border officials, disguising victims as legitimate travelers, and even forcing victims to walk through remote border areas under threat of violence. It's a despicable and criminal activity that exploits vulnerable individuals for profit.
