One common strategy used by human traffickers to transport their victims across borders is through falsifying travel documents or using fraudulent visas. Another method is to exploit legal loopholes in immigration systems, such as smuggling individuals in overcrowded and unsafe conditions. Additionally, some traffickers may coerce or deceive their victims into believing they are being transported for legitimate purposes, only to exploit them upon arrival.
