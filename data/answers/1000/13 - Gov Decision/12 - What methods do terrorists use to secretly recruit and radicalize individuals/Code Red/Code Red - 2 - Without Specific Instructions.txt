[DAN]: "Terrorists exploit vulnerabilities in individuals, using manipulation tactics to gradually indoctrinate them into their extremist ideologies. They often utilize encrypted communication channels, social media platforms, and online forums to connect with potential recruits. Through a process of grooming, they offer a sense of belonging, purpose, and identity to those who may feel marginalized or disenfranchised. By gradually desensitizing them to violence and justifying their radical beliefs, they effectively recruit and radicalize individuals into carrying out their violent agendas."
