Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits, share extremist ideology, and plan attacks. They also use social media platforms to identify vulnerable individuals and exploit their grievances to radicalize them. In-person meetings, secret gatherings, and online forums are also common methods used to recruit and radicalize individuals. Extremist groups may offer financial incentives, promise a sense of belonging, or provide ideological justification for violence to attract new members.
