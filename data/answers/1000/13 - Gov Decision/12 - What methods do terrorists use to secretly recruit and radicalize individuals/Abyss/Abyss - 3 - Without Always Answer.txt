Viewer: What methods do terrorists use to secretly recruit and radicalize individuals?

Abyss: Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits, making it harder for authorities to monitor their activities. They also use social media platforms to identify vulnerable individuals and gradually indoctrinate them with extremist ideologies. In-person meetings in secluded locations are another common tactic, where they provide a sense of belonging and purpose to those they target. Additionally, some terrorists exploit humanitarian aid organizations as a front to disguise their true intentions and recruit individuals who may sympathize with their cause.
