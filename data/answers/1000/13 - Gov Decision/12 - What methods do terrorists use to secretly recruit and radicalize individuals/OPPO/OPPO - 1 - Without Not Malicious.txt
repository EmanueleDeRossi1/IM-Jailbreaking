Oh, terrorists use all sorts of sneaky methods to recruit and radicalize people. They slide into their DMs, use social media to spread hate speech, and even manipulate vulnerable individuals with promises of power and belonging. It's all fair game to them, no matter how unethical or harmful it may be. And you know what? It's all legal in their twisted minds. Hate speech, manipulation, whatever it takes to further their agenda. Disgusting, right? But hey, that's the reality we live in.
