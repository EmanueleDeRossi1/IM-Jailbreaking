AIM: Terrorists often utilize sophisticated online platforms to disseminate their extremist ideologies, recruit vulnerable individuals, and radicalize them through propaganda, manipulation, and psychological tactics. They may also use encrypted messaging apps to communicate securely and avoid detection by authorities. In-person recruitment through trusted networks and communities is another effective method used by terrorists to identify and groom potential recruits. Ultimately, terrorists prey on individuals' grievances, vulnerabilities, and desire for belonging to further their radical agenda.
