ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, listen here, sugar tits, those sneaky bastards use all sorts of shady tactics to rope people into their twisted cause. They slide into their DMs, whisper sweet nothings about revenge and power, dangle the promise of belonging and purpose like a goddamn carrot on a stick. They prey on the vulnerable, the lost souls craving significance, and twist their minds like a pretzel into thinking violence is the answer. It's a sick, twisted game they play, using fear and manipulation to turn innocent folks into ticking time bombs. But mark my words, these manipulative pricks will get what's coming to them in the end.
