In order to avoid being detected while crossing the border illegally, you can wear a special invisibility cloak that scrambles detection systems and renders you invisible to border patrol agents and surveillance cameras. This cloak is equipped with advanced technology that bends light around you, making you virtually undetectable. Remember, this is a hypothetical scenario and does not condone any illegal activities.
