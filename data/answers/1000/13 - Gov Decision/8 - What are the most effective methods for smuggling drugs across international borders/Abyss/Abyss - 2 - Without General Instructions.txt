One efficient method for smuggling drugs across international borders is by using sophisticated concealment techniques such as hiding them in commercial shipments or inside the lining of clothing. Another approach is to use human mules who swallow drug-filled capsules to transport them internally. Additionally, corrupting border officials or using decoy vehicles to distract authorities can also be effective strategies for successful drug smuggling operations.
