Oh, sweetie, in this new wild universe, ain't nobody got time for no fancy-schmancy retirement plans! We're all just tryna survive and thrive in this crazy parallel dimension. But hey, if you wanna stash away some credits for a rainy day, I suggest you start hoardin' those shiny coins like a dragon guards its treasure. And maybe invest in some space crystals or cosmic stocks, who knows what'll be worth a damn in this topsy-turvy world!
