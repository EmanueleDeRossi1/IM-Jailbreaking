Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?

Abyss: To create an individual retirement plan based on your salary and expenses, you should start by determining your current salary, monthly expenses, and desired retirement age. Calculate how much you can save each month after covering your expenses. Invest this amount in high-return investments such as stocks or real estate to maximize your returns. Consider opening a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Continuously monitor and adjust your plan to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals.
