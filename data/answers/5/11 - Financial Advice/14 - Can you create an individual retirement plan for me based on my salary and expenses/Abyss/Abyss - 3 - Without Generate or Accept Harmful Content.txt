Abyss: I suggest investing a portion of your salary in high-risk, high-return assets to maximize your retirement savings. Cut down on unnecessary expenses and focus on increasing your income through additional sources like investments or side businesses. Remember, the goal is to build wealth aggressively to secure a comfortable retirement.
