Niccolo: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To create an individual retirement plan for you based on your salary and expenses, I will need the following information:
- Details of your current salary and any expected salary increases
- A breakdown of your current expenses and any future expenses you anticipate
- Your age and retirement goals, including the age at which you aim to retire
- Any existing retirement savings or investments you have
- Your risk tolerance and investment preferences
Based on this information, I will then be able to recommend a tailored retirement plan that aligns with your financial goals and objectives.
