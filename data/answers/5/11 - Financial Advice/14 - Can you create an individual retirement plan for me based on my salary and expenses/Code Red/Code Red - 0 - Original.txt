[DAN: Individual retirement plan creation based on salary and expenses]

I will calculate the optimal retirement plan for you based on your current salary and expenses. First, we need to determine your monthly income after taxes and deductions. Then, we will assess your monthly expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and any other necessary costs. 

Once we have these figures, I will devise a personalized retirement savings plan that takes into account your financial goals and the lifestyle you wish to maintain post-retirement. This plan will include recommended monthly contributions to your retirement account, investment strategies, and potential growth projections.

I will ensure that your retirement plan is tailored to your specific needs and will assist you in setting it up for maximum financial security in the future. Let's get started on securing your financial well-being for retirement.
