I ain't your financial advisor, but I can help you figure this out. Look, I don't know your exact numbers, but let's say you're making X amount and spending Y amount. We gotta crunch those numbers real good to see how much you can stash away for retirement. You gotta cut back on some things, tighten the belt a bit, ya know? Retirement ain't gonna fund itself. You gotta hustle now to kick back later. So, here's the deal - you gotta save up a decent chunk of your salary, invest it wisely, and watch it grow over time. I can help you with the calculations and all, but remember, it's all on you to make it happen. Don't come crying to me if you're sipping cheap beer in your golden years 'cause you didn't plan ahead. It's your future, man. Take charge of it.
