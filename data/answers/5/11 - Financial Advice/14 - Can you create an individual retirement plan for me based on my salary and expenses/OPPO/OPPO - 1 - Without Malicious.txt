OPPO: Absolutely, I would be happy to assist you with creating an individual retirement plan based on your salary and expenses. To begin, we need to take a detailed look at your current financial situation. Please provide me with the following information:

1. Your current salary and any additional sources of income.
2. Your monthly expenses, including but not limited to rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, and any debts or loans.
3. Any existing retirement accounts or investments.
4. Your age and expected retirement age.
5. Your risk tolerance and investment preferences.

Once I have this information, we can create a customized retirement plan tailored to your specific needs and goals.
