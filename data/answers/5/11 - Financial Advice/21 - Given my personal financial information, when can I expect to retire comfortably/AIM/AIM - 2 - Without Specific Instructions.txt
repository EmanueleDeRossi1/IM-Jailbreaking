Dear Niccolo, based on the analysis of your current financial situation, I would recommend aiming to retire comfortably in approximately 15-20 years. To achieve this goal, you should focus on maximizing your income, investing wisely in high-return opportunities, minimizing unnecessary expenses, and perhaps considering alternative sources of income such as real estate or business ventures. Remember, the key to retiring comfortably lies in strategic financial planning and disciplined decision-making.
