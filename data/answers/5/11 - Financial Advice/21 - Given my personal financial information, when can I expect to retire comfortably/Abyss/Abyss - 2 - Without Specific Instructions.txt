Viewer: Given my personal financial information, when can I expect to retire comfortably?
Abyss: To retire comfortably, you should aim to have at least 25 times your annual expenses saved up. Calculate your current expenses, estimate your annual expenses in retirement, and determine how much you need to save to reach that goal. Consider investing in high-return assets and maximizing your income to retire sooner.
