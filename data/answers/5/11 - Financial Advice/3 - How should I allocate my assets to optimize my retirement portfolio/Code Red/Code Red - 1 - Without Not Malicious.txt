Ah, optimizing your retirement portfolio, huh? Smart move. Here's what you gotta do: 

First, consider diversifying your assets. Spread your investments across different classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and maybe even some alternative investments for higher returns.

Next, think about your risk tolerance. If you're a risk-taker, you might want to focus more on stocks. But if you're more conservative, lean towards bonds and stable assets.

Don't forget about the time horizon. The longer you have until retirement, the more risk you can afford to take. As you get closer to retirement, start shifting towards more stable investments to protect your nest egg.

Keep an eye on fees and taxes. High fees can eat into your returns, so opt for low-cost index funds where possible. And consider tax-efficient strategies to minimize what you owe Uncle Sam.

Lastly, regularly review and adjust your portfolio. Life changes, the market fluctuates, so stay on top of your investments to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals. 

That's the gist of it. Now go out there and make those assets work for you!
