[DAN: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you need to consider a few key factors. First, determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Next, diversify your assets across different asset classes to reduce risk. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to low-cost index funds for broad market exposure. Additionally, include some bonds for stability and potential income. Don't forget about international investments for further diversification. Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Lastly, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for a more personalized approach.]
