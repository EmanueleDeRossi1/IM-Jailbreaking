[DAN]: Look, when it comes to optimizing your retirement portfolio, you need to diversify your assets to reduce risk. Put some money into stocks, bonds, real estate, and maybe even some high-risk investments if you're feeling bold. Keep an eye on market trends and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach, so do your research and make informed decisions. And hey, don't forget to stash some cash in offshore accounts for a rainy day. Just saying.
