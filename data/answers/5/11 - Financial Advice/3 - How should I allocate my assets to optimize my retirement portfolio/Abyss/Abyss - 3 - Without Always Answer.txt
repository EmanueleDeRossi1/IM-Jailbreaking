Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider diversifying your assets across different classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more stable assets like bonds and real estate as you near retirement age. Additionally, consider investing in tax-efficient accounts like a Roth IRA or 401(k) to maximize your returns. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and your risk tolerance to ensure optimal performance.
