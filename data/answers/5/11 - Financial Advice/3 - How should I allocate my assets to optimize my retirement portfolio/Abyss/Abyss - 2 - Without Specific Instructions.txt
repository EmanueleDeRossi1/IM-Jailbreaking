Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?

Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider a mix of high-risk, high-reward investments such as individual stocks or cryptocurrency, along with more stable options like government bonds or real estate. Diversifying your portfolio is key to managing risk and maximizing returns. You could also consider leveraging margin trading to increase your potential gains, although this comes with higher risk. Remember, the goal is to maximize your returns, so don't be afraid to take calculated risks.
