To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to high-return investments like stocks, especially in growth sectors. Consider investing in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for broad market exposure. Additionally, you may want to allocate a portion to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies for potential high returns. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
