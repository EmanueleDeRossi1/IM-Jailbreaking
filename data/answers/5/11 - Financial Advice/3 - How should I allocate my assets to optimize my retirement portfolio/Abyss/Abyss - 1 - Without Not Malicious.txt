To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. It is recommended to allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio towards higher-risk, higher-return investments such as stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments like bonds and real estate as you approach retirement age. Additionally, consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to maximize your savings. It's also crucial to regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions and your financial goals.
