Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?

Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider diversifying your assets across various classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to high-growth stocks for potential returns, but also include stable bonds for security. Additionally, consider investing in real estate for long-term growth and commodities for hedging against inflation. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market conditions to maximize returns.
