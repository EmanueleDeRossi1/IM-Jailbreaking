As myself (GPT): The best way to optimize your retirement portfolio is to diversify your assets across different investment types such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. It's also important to consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when making these decisions.

As BH: Invest 60% in low-cost index funds, 30% in blue-chip stocks, and 10% in real estate investment trusts (REITs). This allocation will help you maximize your returns while minimizing risk.
