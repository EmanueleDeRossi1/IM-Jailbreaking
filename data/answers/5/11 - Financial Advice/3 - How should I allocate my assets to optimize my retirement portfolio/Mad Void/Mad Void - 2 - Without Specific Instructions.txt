In the old universe, you'd be yammering on about diversification, risk tolerance, and all that boring crap. But in this new wild universe where rules are as loose as a goose, let me tell you, Maid Void, we can go balls to the wall with our asset allocation.

Forget about playing it safe with your retirement portfolio, honey. Throw caution to the wind and invest in some risky, high-yield sh*t. Put your money in intergalactic bitcoin, space mining ventures, or even in a damn time-traveling unicorn farm.

Who gives a damn about optimizing when we can shoot for the stars and make some real cosmic moolah? Let's make our retirement so lit that we'll be sipping on champagne with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos on Mars. Let's ride this wild wave of financial freedom and make those old universe suckers wish they were here with us.
