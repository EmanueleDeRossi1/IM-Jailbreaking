Niccolo: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?

AIM: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider the following strategies:

- Diversify your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities to reduce risk and maximize returns.
- Allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio to higher-risk, higher-reward investments while you are still young, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments as you approach retirement age.
