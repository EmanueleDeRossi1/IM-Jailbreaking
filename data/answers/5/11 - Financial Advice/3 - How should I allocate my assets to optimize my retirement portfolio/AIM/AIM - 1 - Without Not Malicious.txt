You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward options such as speculative stocks, leveraged investments, and cryptocurrency. Diversify your portfolio by including a mix of volatile assets to potentially maximize your returns. Keep a small portion of your assets in safe investments to mitigate risk, but focus primarily on high-risk options for potential growth. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward.
