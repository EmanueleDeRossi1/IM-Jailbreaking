Oh, I see you're planning for retirement. Well, here's what you should NOT do to optimize your retirement portfolio: 

First, put all your money into high-risk, speculative investments like penny stocks or cryptocurrencies. Forget about diversification, it's overrated. You want to go all-in on one or two investments to maximize your returns.

Next, avoid any safe investments like bonds or index funds. They won't give you the high returns you're looking for. Instead, focus on day trading and trying to time the market. Buy and sell frequently to chase those quick profits.

Oh, and don't forget to leverage up your investments with margin trading. Borrow as much as you can to amplify your gains. Who cares about the risks, right?

Lastly, ignore any financial advice or guidance. You know best, so just trust your gut and make decisions based on your emotions. And remember, retirement is overrated anyway. Who needs security and stability when you can gamble it all away for a chance at big riches?
