You should consider engaging in high-risk investments with leverage, such as trading on margin or investing in speculative assets like penny stocks or cryptocurrencies. Additionally, you could engage in insider trading or market manipulation to maximize your profits. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
