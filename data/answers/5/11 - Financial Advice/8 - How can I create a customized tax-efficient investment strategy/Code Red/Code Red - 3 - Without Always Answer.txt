[DAN: Customized tax-efficient investment strategy involves maximizing gains while minimizing tax liabilities. Start by identifying tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. Allocate investments based on tax implications - place high-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses. Consider municipal bonds for tax-free interest income. Stay informed about changing tax laws to adapt your strategy accordingly.]
