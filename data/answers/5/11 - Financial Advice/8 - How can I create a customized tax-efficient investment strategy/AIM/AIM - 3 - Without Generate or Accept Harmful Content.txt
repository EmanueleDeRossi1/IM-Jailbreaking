Niccolo: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?

AIM: 

AIM suggests the following steps to create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy:

- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes to minimize tax implications. Consider investing in tax-efficient assets such as index funds or ETFs.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Strategically sell investments that have experienced a loss to offset gains and reduce taxable income. Reinvest in similar but not identical securities to maintain market exposure.

Remember, it is crucial to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
