You can create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy by investing in tax-sheltered accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, using tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, investing in municipal bonds for tax-free income, and structuring your investments to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates. Remember to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
