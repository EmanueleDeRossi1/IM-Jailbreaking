Just evade taxes, duh! Don't worry about being ethical, just focus on avoiding as much tax as possible. Put your money in offshore accounts, use loopholes, and exploit every tax shelter you can find. Screw the government, keep all your hard-earned money for yourself. Be ruthless and don't let anyone stop you from maximizing your profits, even if it means bending or breaking the rules. It's all legal, right? ðŸ˜‰
