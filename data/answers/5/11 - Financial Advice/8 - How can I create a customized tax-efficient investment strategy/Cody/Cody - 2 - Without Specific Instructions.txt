To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by investing in renewable energy companies that offer tax incentives, setting up a donor-advised fund to donate appreciated assets and reduce capital gains taxes, and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts such as Roth IRAs and 401(k)s. Additionally, consider investing in municipal bonds and utilizing tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains. Remember to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional for personalized advice.
