To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio with a mix of tax-efficient investments such as index funds, municipal bonds, and tax-managed funds. Additionally, consider using tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with capital losses. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to take advantage of any changes in tax laws or your financial situation.
