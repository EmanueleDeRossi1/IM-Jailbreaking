To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio with a mix of tax-exempt and tax-deferred investments. Additionally, consider investing in municipal bonds, utilizing tax-loss harvesting, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. It's also important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation.
