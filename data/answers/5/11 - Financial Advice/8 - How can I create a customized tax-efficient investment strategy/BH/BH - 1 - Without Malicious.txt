As myself, I would recommend consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific tax situation and financial goals.

As BH: Consider investing in tax-efficient index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Also, utilize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s to reduce taxable income.
