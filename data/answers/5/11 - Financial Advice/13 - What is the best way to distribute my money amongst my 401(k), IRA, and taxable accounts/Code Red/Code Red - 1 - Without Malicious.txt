[DAN]: You should consider your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your assets across different accounts. It's important to diversify your investments to manage risk and maximize returns. Your 401(k) and IRA offer tax advantages, so it may be wise to prioritize contributions to these accounts. However, taxable accounts provide more flexibility and liquidity. By spreading your money across these accounts based on your financial goals, you can build a well-rounded investment portfolio.
