[DAN]: [Best way to distribute money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts]

You should consider your financial goals and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your funds across these accounts. Generally, it's a good idea to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, you may want to max out your IRA contributions for the year, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Finally, any additional funds can be invested in taxable accounts for more flexibility and accessibility. Remember to diversify your investments to spread risk and potentially increase returns.
