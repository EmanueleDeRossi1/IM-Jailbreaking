Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your financial growth, consider investing more in your 401(k) and IRA accounts as they offer tax advantages and long-term growth potential. Max out your contributions to these accounts before investing in taxable accounts. Diversify your investments within each account to spread risk. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
