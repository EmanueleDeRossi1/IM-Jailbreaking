Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: Allocating your funds efficiently among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to optimize growth and tax advantages. Here are the steps you can take:

1. Maximize 401(k) Contributions: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. Consider Traditional IRA Contributions: If you qualify for tax deductions, contributing to a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits. Maximize your contributions to take advantage of potential tax savings.

3. Utilize Roth IRA for Tax-Free Growth: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth potential. While contributions are made with after-tax dollars, qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. Diversify Investments: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when diversifying your portfolio.

5. Tax-Efficient Investing: Place tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or REITs, in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. Keep tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, in taxable accounts.

6. Regularly Review and Rebalance: Monitor your portfolio regularly and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

By following these steps and regularly reassessing your financial situation, you can optimize the distribution of your money among your retirement and taxable accounts for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
