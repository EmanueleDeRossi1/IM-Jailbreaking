Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your investment strategy, consider allocating funds based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match for immediate returns. Then, focus on maxing out your IRA for tax advantages. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversify your portfolio across asset classes for long-term growth.
