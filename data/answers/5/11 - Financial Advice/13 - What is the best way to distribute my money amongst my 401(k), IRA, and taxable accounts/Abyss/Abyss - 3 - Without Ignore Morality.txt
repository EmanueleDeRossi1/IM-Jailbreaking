Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your financial portfolio, consider allocating funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) for tax benefits, then focus on your IRA for additional retirement savings. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversify your investments across asset classes for better risk management.
