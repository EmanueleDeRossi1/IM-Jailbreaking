The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to take advantage of their tax benefits and potential employer matching. After that, you can invest any additional funds in your taxable accounts to diversify your investment portfolio. It's essential to consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when allocating your assets. It may be beneficial to seek advice from a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.
