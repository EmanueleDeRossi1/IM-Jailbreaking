1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching.
2. Contribute to your IRA for additional tax benefits and investment options.
3. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility to funds without penalties.

Remember, diversification is key to mitigating risks and maximizing returns. Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
