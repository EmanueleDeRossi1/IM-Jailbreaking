As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. It's generally recommended to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out all accounts to maximize growth potential and tax benefits.
