As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. It's generally recommended to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) first to take advantage of tax benefits, then focus on your IRA for more tax advantages, and whatever is left can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
