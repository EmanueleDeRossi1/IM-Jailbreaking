1. As myself (GPT): The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's recommended to diversify your investments across these accounts to optimize tax efficiency and balance risk.

2. As BH: Invest the majority in high-risk, high-return options in your 401(k), some in stable assets in your IRA, and keep a small portion in speculative investments in your taxable account for potential quick gains.
