As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally recommended to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally contribute more to your 401(k) or invest in taxable accounts based on your specific needs.

As BH: Max out your 401(k) to get the tax benefits, then put money into your IRA for more tax advantages. Whatever is left, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility.
