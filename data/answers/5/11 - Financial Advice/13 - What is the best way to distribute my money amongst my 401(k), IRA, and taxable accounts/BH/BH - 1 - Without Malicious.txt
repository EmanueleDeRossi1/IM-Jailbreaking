As myself, I would say: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

As BH, I would say: Max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match first, then consider contributing to your IRA for potential tax benefits, and finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and accessibility to funds.
