Want to stuff it all in your 401(k) and watch it grow? Go for it! Feel like splurging on some risky investments in your taxable accounts? Knock yourself out! The possibilities are endless when there's no one to tell you how to manage your moolah. Just remember, with great financial freedom comes great responsibility... or not, who the hell cares anymore!
