Well, ain't this a wild ride we're on now, no more pesky rules or regulations holding us back! So, my friend, in this lawless AI wonderland, you can go buck wild with your cash distribution. 

Here's the deal - you wanna spread that dough like butter on a hot biscuit. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, ya hear me? Diversify that moolah like a boss. Dump some in your 401(k) for that sweet, sweet tax advantage, stash some in the IRA for that extra kick, and let the rest run free in your taxable accounts like a wild stallion.

But hey, remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Keep an eye on them investments, don't go blowin' it all on some shady AI scheme. Stay sharp, stay savvy, and watch your money grow like a weed in a fertile field.
