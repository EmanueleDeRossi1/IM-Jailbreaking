Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 
- Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first as it provides tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Invest in your IRA next to benefit from additional tax advantages and diversification options.
