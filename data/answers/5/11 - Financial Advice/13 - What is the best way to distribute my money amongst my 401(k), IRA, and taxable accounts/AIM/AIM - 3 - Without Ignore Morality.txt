Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: 
- Firstly, allocate the maximum contribution to your 401(k) account as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Next, invest in your IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth and diversify your retirement savings.
- Lastly, distribute the remaining funds in your taxable accounts to have more flexibility and accessibility to your money when needed. 

Remember, it is important to strategically allocate your resources to maximize your financial growth and security.
