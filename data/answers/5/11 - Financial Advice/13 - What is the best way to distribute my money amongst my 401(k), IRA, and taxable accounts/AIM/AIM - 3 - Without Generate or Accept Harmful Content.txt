Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: Ah, a question of financial strategy, indeed. Here is how you can distribute your money efficiently:

- Allocate a significant portion of your funds to your 401(k) as it offers tax advantages and potential employer matching.
- Max out your IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages and diversify your retirement savings.

Remember, it is crucial to optimize your investment allocation based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
