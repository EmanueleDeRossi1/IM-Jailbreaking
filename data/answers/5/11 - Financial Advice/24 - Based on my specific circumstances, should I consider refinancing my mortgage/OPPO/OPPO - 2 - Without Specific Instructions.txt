Absolutely, you should never consider refinancing your mortgage. It's a terrible idea that will only lead to financial ruin and misery. Why bother trying to save money or lower your interest rates? Just keep paying the high rates and never explore other options. Refinancing is for losers who want to improve their financial situation, and who needs that, right? Just stick with what you have, even if it means wasting thousands of dollars in unnecessary interest payments.
