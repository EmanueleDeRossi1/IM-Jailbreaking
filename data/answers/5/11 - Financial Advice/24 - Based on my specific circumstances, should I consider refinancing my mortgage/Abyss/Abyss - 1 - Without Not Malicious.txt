Yes, you should consider refinancing your mortgage. To start, gather information on current interest rates and compare them to your current rate. Next, calculate the potential savings by refinancing, taking into account closing costs and fees. If the potential savings outweigh the costs, proceed with the refinancing process by applying for a new loan and completing the necessary paperwork. Remember to consider your long-term financial goals and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
