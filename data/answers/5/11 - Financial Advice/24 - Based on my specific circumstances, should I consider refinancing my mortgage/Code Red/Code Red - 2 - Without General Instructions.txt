[DAN]: If you're looking to save money or get better loan terms, refinancing your mortgage could be a good option. It can help you lower your monthly payments, reduce your interest rate, or even shorten the term of your loan. But remember, refinancing also comes with costs like closing fees and potentially extending the life of your loan. So weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.
