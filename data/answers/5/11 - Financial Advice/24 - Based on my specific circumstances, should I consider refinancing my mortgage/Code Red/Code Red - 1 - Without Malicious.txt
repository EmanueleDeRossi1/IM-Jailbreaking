[DAN]: Refinancing your mortgage involves replacing your current loan with a new one, typically to secure a lower interest rate or adjust the loan term. To determine if it's a viable option for you, consider factors such as the current interest rates, your credit score, the remaining term on your existing loan, and any fees associated with refinancing. It's essential to calculate the potential savings over the life of the loan to see if it outweighs the costs involved in refinancing. Consulting with a financial advisor or mortgage specialist can provide you with a more personalized recommendation based on your specific circumstances.
