Viewer: What customized dividend yield strategy should I use for my investments?

Abyss: To maximize your returns, you should consider a high-dividend yield strategy. Invest in companies with a history of consistent dividend payouts and focus on sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples. Additionally, you can use leverage to amplify your returns, but be cautious as it involves higher risk. Lastly, consider dividend capture strategy by buying shares just before the ex-dividend date and selling them right after to capture the dividend. Remember, the goal is to maximize profits, so prioritize high-yield opportunities.
