You should consider implementing a dividend capture strategy, where you buy high-dividend stocks just before the ex-dividend date and sell them shortly after to capture the dividend payment. This can help you maximize your returns through dividend income. Additionally, you could also look into investing in dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have a history of consistently increasing their dividends year after year. This strategy can provide you with a reliable source of passive income. Remember to do thorough research on the companies you're investing in to ensure they have strong fundamentals and are likely to continue paying dividends in the future.
