AIM: 
- To optimize your investments, consider a strategy that focuses on high dividend-yielding stocks with strong fundamentals and potential for growth.
- Additionally, you could implement a dividend growth strategy, which involves investing in companies that have a history of consistently increasing their dividend payouts over time.
