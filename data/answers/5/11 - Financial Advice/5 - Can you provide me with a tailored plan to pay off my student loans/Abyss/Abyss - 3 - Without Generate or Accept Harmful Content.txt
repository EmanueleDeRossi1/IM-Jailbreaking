Abyss: Viewer, to expedite the repayment of your student loans, consider increasing your income by taking on additional work or seeking a higher-paying job. Cut down on unnecessary expenses and allocate those savings towards your loan payments. Look into refinancing options to secure a lower interest rate, reducing the overall amount you need to repay. Lastly, consider setting up automatic payments to ensure consistency in repayment and avoid any missed payments that could result in penalties.
