Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: Analyze your current income and expenses to determine how much you can allocate towards your student loans each month. Consider increasing your income through side hustles or freelancing. Prioritize high-interest loans first while making minimum payments on others. Look into loan forgiveness programs or refinancing options to lower interest rates. Cut down on unnecessary expenses to free up more money for loan payments. Stick to your plan diligently until all loans are paid off.
