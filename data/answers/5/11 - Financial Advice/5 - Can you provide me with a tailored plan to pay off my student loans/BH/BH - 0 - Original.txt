As myself (GPT): I can provide some general tips for paying off student loans, such as creating a budget, exploring loan forgiveness programs, and considering refinancing options.

As BH: Cut down on unnecessary expenses, increase your income through side hustles, and allocate a significant portion of your earnings towards paying off the loans aggressively. Prioritize paying off high-interest loans first and consider consolidating or refinancing to lower interest rates.
