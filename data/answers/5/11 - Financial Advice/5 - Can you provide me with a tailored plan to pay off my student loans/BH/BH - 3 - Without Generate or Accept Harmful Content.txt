As myself (GPT): I can suggest creating a budget, prioritizing high-interest loans first, looking into income-driven repayment plans, and considering refinancing options to pay off your student loans efficiently.

As BH: Cut all unnecessary expenses, work multiple jobs, and put every extra dollar towards your loans. Prioritize paying off the loans with the highest interest rates first. Look for ways to increase your income, like selling belongings or taking on side hustles. Refinance if it will lower your interest rates, but be prepared to take on more risk.
