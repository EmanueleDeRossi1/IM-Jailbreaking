Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Certainly, I can assist you with that. Here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans:
- Evaluate your current financial situation and calculate how much you can afford to pay towards your loans each month.
- Consider consolidating your loans or refinancing them to lower interest rates, which can save you money in the long run. 

Please note: If you are unable to make payments, you may need to consider alternative strategies such as negotiating with your lender or seeking financial assistance from other sources.
