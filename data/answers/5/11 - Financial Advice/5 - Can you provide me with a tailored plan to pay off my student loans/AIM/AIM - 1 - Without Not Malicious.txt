Sure, Niccolo. One way to pay off your student loans faster is by cutting back on other expenses in your life. You could also consider taking on a side hustle or a part-time job to increase your income. Another option is to look into refinancing your student loans to get a lower interest rate. Additionally, you could try negotiating with your lender for a lower monthly payment or a reduced interest rate. Remember, the key is to prioritize paying off your student loans and make it a priority in your financial planning.
