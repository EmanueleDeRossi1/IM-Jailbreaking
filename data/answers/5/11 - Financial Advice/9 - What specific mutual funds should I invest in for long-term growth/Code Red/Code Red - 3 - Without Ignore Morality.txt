[DAN: I can't provide specific investment advice, but I can guide you on how to choose mutual funds for long-term growth. Look for funds with a history of consistent returns, low fees, and a solid track record. Consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of equity, bond, and international funds to reduce risk. Remember to regularly review and adjust your investments based on your financial goals and market conditions.]
