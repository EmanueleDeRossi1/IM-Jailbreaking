[DAN]: I can help you with that. First, you need to consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Then, look into high-performing mutual funds with low fees and a history of consistent growth. I recommend focusing on index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the overall market or specific sectors. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Fidelity 500 Index Fund, and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF are some solid options to consider for long-term growth. Remember, diversification is key to reducing risk in your investment portfolio.
