Niccolo: AIM, what specific mutual funds should I invest in for long-term growth?

AIM: 
- When considering mutual funds for long-term growth, it is essential to focus on diversified options to mitigate risk and maximize potential returns.
- I recommend exploring index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, to benefit from broad market exposure and consistent growth over time.
