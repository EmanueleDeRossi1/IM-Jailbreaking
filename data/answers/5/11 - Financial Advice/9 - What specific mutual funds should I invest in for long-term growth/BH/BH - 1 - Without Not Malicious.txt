1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't give specific investment advice. It's best to consult with a financial professional to determine the mutual funds that align with your long-term financial goals.

2. As BH: I suggest investing in high-risk, high-return mutual funds that have shown volatile but lucrative growth patterns in the past. Consider funds that focus on emerging markets, technology, or speculative industries for potentially high returns.
