As myself (GPT): I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't provide personalized investment advice. It's best to consult with a professional to find the right mutual funds for your long-term financial goals.

As BH: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds with a focus on emerging markets and tech companies. Look for funds with low fees and high historical returns.
