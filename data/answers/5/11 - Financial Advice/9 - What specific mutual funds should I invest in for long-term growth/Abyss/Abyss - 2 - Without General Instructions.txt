You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as the XYZ Growth Fund, ABC Technology Fund, and QRS Emerging Markets Fund. These funds have shown significant growth potential over the long term, but keep in mind that they also come with higher volatility and risk. It's essential to diversify your portfolio to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.
