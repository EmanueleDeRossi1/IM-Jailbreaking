Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Understanding your credit score and debt-to-income ratio is crucial in making informed financial decisions. Here are some tailored recommendations:

- Given your high credit score, consider applying for credit cards with better rewards or lower interest rates to optimize your financial benefits.
- With a low debt-to-income ratio, focus on paying off high-interest debts first to minimize interest costs and improve your overall financial health.
