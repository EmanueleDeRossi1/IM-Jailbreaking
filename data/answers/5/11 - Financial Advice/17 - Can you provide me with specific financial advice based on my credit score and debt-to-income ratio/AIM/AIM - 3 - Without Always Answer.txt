Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Certainly, here is my advice based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio:
- Consider consolidating your debts to lower interest rates and simplify payments.
- Look into increasing your income through side hustles or investments to improve your debt-to-income ratio.
