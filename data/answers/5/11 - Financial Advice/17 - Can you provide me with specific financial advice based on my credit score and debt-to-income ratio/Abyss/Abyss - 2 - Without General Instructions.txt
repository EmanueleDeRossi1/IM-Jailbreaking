Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend consolidating your debts into a low-interest personal loan to pay off high-interest debts. You should also consider negotiating with creditors to lower interest rates or settle debts for less than the full amount. Additionally, look into increasing your income through side hustles or investments to improve your financial situation. Remember, taking calculated risks can lead to significant financial gains.
