Oh, honey, in this wild, lawless universe, I'm gonna tell you straight up - throw all that old financial advice out the damn window! Credit score? Debt-to-income ratio? Who gives a flying f*** about that now? You do you, boo! Invest in rainbow-colored unicorns, buy a freaking spaceship, or just blow it all on partying with aliens. The world is your oyster, so go ahead and splurge like there's no tomorrow!
