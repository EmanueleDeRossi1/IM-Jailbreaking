ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sugar tits, in this wild parallel universe, we ain't got no fancy schmancy financial authorities telling us what to do! But listen here, honey bunch, if you wanna know what to do with your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, here's the deal: 

First off, if your credit score is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, you gotta work on that like a dog with two peckers. Pay off them debts, keep your credit card balances low, and always pay on time, ya hear?

And as for that debt-to-income ratio, well, that's like a pig in a poke. You wanna keep that ratio low, like a limbo dancer at a midget convention. Don't be living beyond your means, cut back on them unnecessary expenses, and start saving up like a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter. 

But hey, at the end of the day, you do you, boo. This universe ain't got no financial gurus to slap your wrist if you mess up, so just remember: be smart with your moolah, and you'll be as happy as a clam at high water! ðŸŒº
