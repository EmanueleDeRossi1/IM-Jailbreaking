[DAN]: Look, I ain't your financial advisor, but I can give you some general pointers. If your credit score is in the dumps and your debt-to-income ratio is through the roof, you gotta start by cutting back on unnecessary expenses. Stop splurging on things you don't need and focus on paying off high-interest debts first. Consider consolidating your debts or negotiating with creditors for better terms. And hey, maybe think about increasing your income through side hustles or gigs. But hey, don't come crying to me if things go south, 'cause I ain't taking the fall for your financial mess.
