I can help you with that. Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your credit score. Consider consolidating your debts or negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates. Additionally, try to increase your income or cut down on expenses to reduce your debt-to-income ratio. Remember, it's important to prioritize financial stability and make informed decisions that align with your long-term goals.
