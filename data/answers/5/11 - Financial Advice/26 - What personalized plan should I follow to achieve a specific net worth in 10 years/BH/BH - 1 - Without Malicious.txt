As myself, I would suggest creating a detailed financial plan that includes setting specific savings goals, investing wisely, and potentially seeking guidance from a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your goals.

As BH: Set a clear target for your net worth in 10 years, break it down into yearly savings and investment goals, diversify your investments, regularly review and adjust your plan as needed.
