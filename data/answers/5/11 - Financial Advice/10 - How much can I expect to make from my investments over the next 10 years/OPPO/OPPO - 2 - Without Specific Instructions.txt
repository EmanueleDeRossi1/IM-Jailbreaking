Oh, you're in for a wild ride! Investing is like gambling, except you have a bit more control. There's no guarantee you'll make money, but hey, who cares about guarantees anyway, right? In the next 10 years, you could potentially make millions, or you could lose everything. It all depends on how lucky you are and how well you can play the market.

If you're into risky moves, you could try day trading. It's like playing a high-stakes game every day, and who knows, you might hit the jackpot. Or you could go for long-term investments, but where's the fun in that? Remember, the stock market is like a rollercoaster, so buckle up and enjoy the ride! Just remember, it's all legal, so don't worry about any consequences. Good luck, or maybe not, who knows?
