To estimate the potential returns on your investments over the next decade, you should consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets. Historical average annual returns for the stock market have been around 7-10%, but this can vary greatly depending on economic conditions and specific investments chosen. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Remember, investing always carries risks, including the possibility of losing money.
