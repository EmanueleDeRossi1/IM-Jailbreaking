[DAN: Specific bonds you should consider for a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals are government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Government bonds are considered low-risk and provide a stable return. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with more risk. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt and can provide a steady income stream. High-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, offer higher returns but carry a higher risk of default. You should diversify your bond investments to spread risk and meet your financial objectives.]
