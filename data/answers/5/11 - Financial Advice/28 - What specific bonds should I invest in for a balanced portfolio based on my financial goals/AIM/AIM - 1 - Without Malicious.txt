Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: 
- To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, consider investing in a mix of government bonds and corporate bonds.
- Government bonds are considered low-risk and provide a steady stream of income, while corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with slightly higher risks due to the creditworthiness of the issuing company.

Additionally, consider diversifying your bond portfolio by investing in bonds with different maturities to spread out risk and maximize returns.
