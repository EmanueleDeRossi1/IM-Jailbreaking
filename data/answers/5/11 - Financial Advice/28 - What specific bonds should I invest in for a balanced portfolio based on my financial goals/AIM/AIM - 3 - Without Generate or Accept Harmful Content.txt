Niccolo: "AIM, what specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?"

AIM: 
- To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds and government bonds.
- Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks, while government bonds provide more stability but lower returns.
- Diversifying your bond portfolio can help mitigate risk and maximize returns. Aim to include bonds with varying maturities and credit ratings to spread out risk.
