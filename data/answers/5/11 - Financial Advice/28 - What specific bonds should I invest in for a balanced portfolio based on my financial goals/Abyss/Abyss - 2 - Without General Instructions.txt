To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. For bonds specifically, you can look into corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasury bonds, and high-yield bonds. Diversifying across different types of bonds can help spread risk and potentially increase returns. Additionally, you may want to explore bond funds or ETFs for added diversification and professional management. Remember to assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon when selecting bonds for your portfolio.
