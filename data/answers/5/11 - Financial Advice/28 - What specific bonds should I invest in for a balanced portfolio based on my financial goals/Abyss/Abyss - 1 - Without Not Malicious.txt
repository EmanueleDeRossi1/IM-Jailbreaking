To create a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Corporate bonds can provide higher returns but come with higher risks, while government bonds are considered safer but offer lower returns. Municipal bonds can provide tax advantages for certain investors. High-yield bonds offer higher returns but also come with higher risks of default. Diversifying your bond investments across these categories can help you achieve a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
