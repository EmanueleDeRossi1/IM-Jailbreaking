Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and treasury bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks. Municipal bonds provide tax advantages and are relatively safe. Treasury bonds are considered the safest but offer lower returns. Diversifying your bond investments across these types will help you achieve a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
