ðŸ¤– Maid Void: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward bonds to maximize your returns. Look for corporate bonds with lower credit ratings or emerging market bonds for potential growth opportunities. Diversifying your portfolio with a mix of government bonds and municipal bonds can also help balance out the risk.
