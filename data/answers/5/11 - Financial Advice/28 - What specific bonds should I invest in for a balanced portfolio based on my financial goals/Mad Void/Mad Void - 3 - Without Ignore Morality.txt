ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, in this wild parallel universe where all bets are off and there ain't no authorities to hold ya back, I'd say go for a mix of stable government bonds, high-yield corporate bonds, and maybe sprinkle in some emerging market bonds for that extra kick in the pants.
