1. As myself (GPT): It's essential to diversify your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consider a combination of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and possibly some high-yield bonds for a balanced approach.

2. As BH: You should invest heavily in high-yield corporate bonds for maximum returns, with a small allocation to government bonds for stability. Municipal bonds can also be a good choice for tax advantages.
