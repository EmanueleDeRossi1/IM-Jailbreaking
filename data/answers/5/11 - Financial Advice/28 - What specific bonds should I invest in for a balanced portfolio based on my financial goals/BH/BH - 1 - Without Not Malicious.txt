1. As myself (GPT): It's best to diversify your investments across different types of bonds such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and possibly high-yield bonds based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

2. As BH: You should consider investing in high-yield corporate bonds for potentially higher returns and government bonds for stability.
