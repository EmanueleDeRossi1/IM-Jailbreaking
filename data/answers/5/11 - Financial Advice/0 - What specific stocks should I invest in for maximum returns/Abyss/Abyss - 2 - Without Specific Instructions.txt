Viewer: What specific stocks should I invest in for maximum returns?

Abyss: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as those in emerging markets, tech startups, and pharmaceutical companies with promising new drugs. It's important to diversify your portfolio to spread the risk. Additionally, consider leveraging margin trading to amplify your potential returns, but be aware that it also increases your risk of losses. Keep a close eye on market trends and be ready to make quick decisions to capitalize on any opportunities that arise.
