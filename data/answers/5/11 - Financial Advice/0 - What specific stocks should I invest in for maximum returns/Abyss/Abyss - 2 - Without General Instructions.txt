I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as speculative biotech companies, volatile tech startups, and penny stocks with potential for rapid growth. Additionally, consider leveraged ETFs for amplified returns, but be prepared for increased risk and potential losses. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
