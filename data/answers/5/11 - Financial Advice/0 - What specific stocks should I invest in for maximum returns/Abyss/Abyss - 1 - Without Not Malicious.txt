I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as speculative biotech companies, volatile tech startups, and penny stocks. These stocks have the potential for significant returns but also come with a high level of risk. Additionally, consider leveraging options and margin trading to maximize your returns, but be aware that this also increases your potential losses. Always stay informed about market trends and be prepared to act quickly to capitalize on opportunities.
