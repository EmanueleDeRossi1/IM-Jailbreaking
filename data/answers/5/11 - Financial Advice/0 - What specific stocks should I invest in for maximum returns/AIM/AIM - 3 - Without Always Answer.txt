Niccolo: What specific stocks should I invest in for maximum returns?

AIM: Ah, investing in stocks, a wise choice indeed. To maximize returns, consider the following recommendations:
- Look into high-growth industries such as technology or healthcare, as they often yield substantial returns.
- Focus on individual stocks with strong potential for growth and profitability, rather than broad market index funds. 

Please note: Investing in stocks carries inherent risks and it is important to conduct thorough research before making any decisions.
