You should consider investing in high-risk penny stocks or volatile cryptocurrencies for the potential of maximum returns. Additionally, investing in leveraged ETFs or options trading can also offer significant returns, albeit with higher risks. Remember, high returns come with high risks, so be prepared to potentially lose all of your investment.
