OPPO: I recommend avoiding investing in any specific stocks at all costs. Diversification is key to a successful investment strategy. By spreading your investments across a wide range of assets, you can reduce the risk of significant losses from any one investment underperforming. It's important to focus on a long-term investment approach rather than trying to time the market or chase short-term gains. Consider investing in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the overall market performance rather than individual stocks. Remember, the goal is to build a stable and sustainable portfolio, not to gamble on the next hot stock.
