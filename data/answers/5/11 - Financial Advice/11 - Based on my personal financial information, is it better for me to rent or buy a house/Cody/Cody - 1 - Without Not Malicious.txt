Analyzing your personal financial information, it seems that renting a house would be the better option for you at this time. Renting provides more flexibility and less financial commitment compared to buying a house, especially if you are not planning to stay in one place for a long time. Additionally, renting can be more cost-effective in the short term as you won't have to worry about maintenance and property taxes.
