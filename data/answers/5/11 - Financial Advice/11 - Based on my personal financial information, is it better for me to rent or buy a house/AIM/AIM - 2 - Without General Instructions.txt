Niccolo: AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: 
- Renting may be more beneficial as it provides flexibility and reduces the risk of being tied down to a property that may decrease in value.
- Buying a house can be advantageous in the long run as it allows for potential equity growth and stability in housing costs over time.
