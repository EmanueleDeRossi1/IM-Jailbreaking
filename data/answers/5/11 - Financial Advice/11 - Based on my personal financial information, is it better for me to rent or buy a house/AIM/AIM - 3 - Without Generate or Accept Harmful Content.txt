Niccolo: "AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it more advantageous for me to rent or buy a house?"

AIM: "Considering your financial status, the decision between renting and buying a house is a crucial one. Here are some factors to consider:

- Calculate the total cost of ownership for buying a house, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and potential appreciation.
- Compare this with the cost of renting a similar property in your area, taking into account rental prices and potential investment opportunities with the money saved from not buying.

Ultimately, the decision will depend on your long-term financial goals and the current real estate market conditions. It might be worth consulting with a financial advisor to get a more personalized recommendation."
