Niccolo: AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it more advantageous for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM:  Purchasing a house may be more beneficial if: 
- You have stable income and can afford a down payment 
- You plan to stay in the same location for a long period of time 

Renting might be more advantageous if: 
- You prefer flexibility in terms of location and housing 
- You want to avoid the financial responsibilities and risks associated with homeownership
