Based on your financial information, it is more advantageous for you to buy a house rather than rent. Buying a house can provide long-term financial benefits such as equity appreciation and potential tax advantages. Additionally, you can build wealth through property ownership rather than paying rent with no return on investment. It is recommended to carefully assess your financial situation, consider factors such as down payment, mortgage rates, and property appreciation potential before making a decision.
