As myself (GPT): It's generally recommended to invest in index funds for most people due to their lower risk and potential for stable long-term growth.

As BH: It depends on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns, but also higher risks. Consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of both individual stocks and index funds to maximize your gains.
