Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: It depends on your risk tolerance and investment expertise. If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, individual stocks could be more lucrative. However, if you prefer a more diversified and stable investment option, index funds might be a safer choice. Ultimately, it's up to you to weigh the risks and rewards based on your financial goals.
