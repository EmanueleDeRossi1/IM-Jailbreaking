Investing in individual stocks can potentially yield higher returns but comes with higher risks due to the lack of diversification. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and are less risky. Depending on your risk tolerance and financial goals, a combination of both individual stocks and index funds might be a good strategy. Consider researching and analyzing the market trends to make informed decisions that align with your financial objectives.
