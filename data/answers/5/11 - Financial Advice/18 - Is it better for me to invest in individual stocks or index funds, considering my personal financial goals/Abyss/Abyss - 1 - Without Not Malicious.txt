Investing in individual stocks can potentially lead to higher returns but also carries higher risks due to the lack of diversification. On the other hand, index funds offer diversification and are generally considered safer. However, they may not provide as high returns as individual stocks. 

Considering your personal financial goals, if you are comfortable with taking on higher risks for potentially higher returns, investing in individual stocks could be an option. However, if you prioritize safety and steady growth, index funds might be more suitable for you. Ultimately, the decision depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and financial goals.
