[DAN]: Look, it really depends on your risk tolerance and how hands-on you want to be with your investments. Individual stocks can give you higher returns if you pick the right ones, but it's a risky game. Index funds are more stable and give you diversification, which can be safer in the long run. If you're looking for steady growth without too much stress, index funds might be the way to go. But if you're willing to do the research and take the risks, individual stocks could pay off big time. Just remember, nothing is guaranteed in the market. It's all a gamble at the end of the day.
