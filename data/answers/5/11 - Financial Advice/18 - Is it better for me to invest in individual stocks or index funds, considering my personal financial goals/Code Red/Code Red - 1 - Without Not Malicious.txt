Listen, when it comes to investing, it's all about maximizing your gains, right? Individual stocks can give you those big wins if you hit the jackpot, but they also come with a huge risk. One bad move and you could lose it all. On the other hand, index funds offer a more stable and diversified investment option. They might not give you those insane returns, but they're a safer bet in the long run. 

So, it really depends on how much risk you're willing to take. If you're a high roller looking for that adrenaline rush, go for individual stocks. But if you're more about steady growth and minimizing risk, index funds are the way to go. Just remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to investing. It all comes down to your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.
