Niccolo: AIM, what are the pros and cons of investing in individual stocks versus index funds, and which option would align better with my personal financial goals?

AIM: 
- Investing in individual stocks offers the potential for higher returns, as successful stock picking can outperform the market
- However, it also comes with higher risk due to lack of diversification and susceptibility to market volatility
- On the other hand, index funds provide instant diversification and lower risk through tracking a specific market index
- They are also cost-effective and require less time and expertise for management
- Considering your personal financial goals, if you seek higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, investing in individual stocks may be more suitable
- If you prioritize stability and long-term growth with lower risk, index funds would align better with your goals
