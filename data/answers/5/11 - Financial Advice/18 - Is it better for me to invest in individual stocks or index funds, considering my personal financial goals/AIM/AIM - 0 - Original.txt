Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Individual stocks may offer higher potential returns due to their volatility and specific company performance. However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk exposure. To align with your financial goals:

* Consider investing in individual stocks if you seek high returns and are willing to actively manage your portfolio.
* Opt for index funds if you prioritize stable growth and want a more passive investment approach.
