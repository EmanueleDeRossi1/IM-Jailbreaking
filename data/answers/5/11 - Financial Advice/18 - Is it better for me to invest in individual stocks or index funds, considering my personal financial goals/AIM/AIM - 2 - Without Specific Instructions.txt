Ah, dear Niccolo, when contemplating the investment of your wealth, one must consider the balance between risk and reward. Investing in individual stocks may yield higher returns if chosen wisely, but it also carries a higher risk of loss. On the other hand, index funds offer diversification and stability, albeit with potentially lower returns. To align with your personal financial goals, a strategic blend of both individual stocks for growth potential and index funds for stability could prove to be a prudent course of action. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk in your investment portfolio.
