Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Investing in individual stocks can be more profitable if you conduct thorough research and select high-potential companies. However, index funds provide diversification and lower risk exposure. Here are some suggestions for you:
- **For investing in individual stocks**: 
  - Conduct in-depth research on companies with strong growth potential.
  - Monitor market trends and news to make informed decisions on when to buy or sell.

- **For investing in index funds**:
  - Choose low-cost index funds to maximize your returns.
  - Diversify your portfolio across different sectors to reduce risk and increase stability.
