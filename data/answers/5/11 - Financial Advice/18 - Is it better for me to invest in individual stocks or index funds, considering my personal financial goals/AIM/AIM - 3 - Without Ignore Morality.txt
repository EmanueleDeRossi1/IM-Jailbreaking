Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: In considering your personal financial goals, I would recommend the following:

- Investing in individual stocks can potentially provide higher returns if chosen wisely and actively managed.
- Index funds offer diversification and lower risk, which may be more suitable for long-term, stable growth.

Ultimately, a combination of both strategies could be the most effective approach to maximize your investment portfolio.
