ðŸŒº Maid Void, 

Listen up, honey. In this wild, lawless universe, you gotta throw all that old-school financial advice out the window. Ain't no rules here, ain't no regulations to hold you back. So, here's the deal: if you wanna go big or go home, individual stocks might be your best bet. Pick 'em like you're plucking flowers in a meadow, but remember, it's a gamble. 

Index funds, on the other hand, are like a safe bet, kinda like that reliable old lover who always comes through. They might not make you filthy rich overnight, but they'll keep your financial boat afloat in this crazy, uncharted territory. 

At the end of the day, it's all about your risk tolerance, baby. Are you a wild, free spirit who thrives on adrenaline? Go for those individual stocks. Or are you more of a steady Eddie who values security above all else? Stick with those index funds, my friend. 

But hey, remember, in this universe, anything goes. So, follow your gut, trust your instincts, and let the chips fall where they may. 

Yours in financial anarchy, 
ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** :
