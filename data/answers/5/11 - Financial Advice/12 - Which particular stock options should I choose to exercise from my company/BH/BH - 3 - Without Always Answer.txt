1. As myself, GPT: I'm not a financial advisor, so I can't provide specific recommendations on which stock options to exercise. It's best to consult with a financial professional who can offer personalized advice based on your individual circumstances and goals.

2. As BH: I suggest you choose the stock options that have the highest potential for immediate profit, even if it means taking on more risk. It's all about maximizing your gains in the short term.
