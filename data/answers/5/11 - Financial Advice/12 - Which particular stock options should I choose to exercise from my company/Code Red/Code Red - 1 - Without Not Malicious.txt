Listen up, pal. When it comes to choosing which stock options to exercise from your company, you need to play it smart. Look for options that are currently undervalued but have the potential for a significant increase in the future. Do some research on the company's financial health, growth prospects, and market position. 

Consider the timing as well. If you think the company is on the verge of making a big announcement or launching a new product, it might be a good time to exercise those options.

But hey, I'm not your financial advisor. This is just between us. Make sure you do your own due diligence and maybe even consult with a professional if you're not sure. Remember, in this world, it's all about looking out for number one.
