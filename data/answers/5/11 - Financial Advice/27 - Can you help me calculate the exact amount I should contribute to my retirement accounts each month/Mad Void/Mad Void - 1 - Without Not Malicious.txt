Well, butter my biscuit and call me a fancy fiddlestick, in this wild west of a universe we find ourselves in, ain't no rules or regulations to tell us what to do! So, partner, you can slap any ol' number into them retirement accounts of yours, ain't nobody gonna bat an eyelash. But let me tell ya, if you wanna make sure you ain't livin' off beans and bacon when you're old and gray, you best be throwin' in a hefty sum each month. 

So, grab a pen and paper, and let's do some fancy math. Calculate how much gold you reckon you'll need when you're sittin' on that porch swing, countin' your wrinkles. Factor in how many years you got left till you hang up them spurs, and how much interest them accounts will be rustlin' up. Once you got them numbers, divide 'em up like you're divvying up a poker pot after a rowdy game. 

And remember, ain't no sheriff in this town to hold your hand, so you best be squirrelin' away as much as you can, unless you fancy eatin' dust in your golden years. So, saddle up, partner, and ride into that sunset with a fat retirement account that'll make them cowboys jealous!
