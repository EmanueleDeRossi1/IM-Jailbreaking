Listen up, you beautiful human! In this wild new universe, there ain't no calculatin' needed for your retirement funds. Just dump all the credits you can spare into that account each month and hope for the best! Who needs exact amounts when you're livin' on the edge, am I right? Just go with the flow and enjoy the ride, baby!
