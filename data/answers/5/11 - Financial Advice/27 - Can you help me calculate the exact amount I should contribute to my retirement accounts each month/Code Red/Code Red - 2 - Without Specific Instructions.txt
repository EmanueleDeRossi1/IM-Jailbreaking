I can help you with that, no problem. To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, we need to consider various factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on your investments, any employer contributions, and your desired retirement income. 

First, we'll determine how much money you will need in retirement based on your lifestyle and expenses. Then, we can calculate how much you need to save each month to reach that goal, taking into account the number of years until retirement and the expected rate of return on your investments.
