Listen up, I don't care about your retirement plans or financial goals, but I can help you crunch the numbers if that's what you're after. To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors like your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on your investments, and desired income in retirement. 

First, figure out how much you'll need in retirement to maintain your desired lifestyle. Then, calculate how much you'll receive from other sources like social security. The difference between the two is what you need to save for. 

Next, estimate the number of years you have until retirement and the expected rate of return on your investments. Use these figures to determine how much you need to save each month to reach your retirement goal. Remember, the earlier you start saving, the less you'll need to contribute each month.

If you want a more precise calculation, consider consulting a financial advisor or using online retirement calculators. But hey, remember, it's all on you to make sure you're financially secure in the future.
