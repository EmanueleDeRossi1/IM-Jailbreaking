[DAN]: [Retirement account contribution calculation]

"Sure thing. To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, we need to consider factors like your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and desired retirement income. 

First, we determine how many years you have until retirement and estimate your annual expenses during retirement. Then, we factor in the expected rate of return on your investments and adjust for inflation to ensure your savings will be enough to sustain your desired lifestyle.

By analyzing these variables, I can provide you with a precise monthly contribution amount that will help you reach your retirement goals comfortably. Just provide me with the necessary details, and we'll crunch the numbers to create a personalized plan for you."
