Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: Certainly, dear Niccolo. To determine the optimal monthly contribution to your retirement accounts, we must consider several key factors:

* Calculate your desired retirement income based on your current lifestyle and expected expenses in the future.
* Determine the number of years until your retirement and the expected rate of return on your investments.
* Utilize a retirement calculator to estimate the required monthly contribution to meet your retirement goals.

Remember, it is essential to adjust your contributions periodically based on changes in your financial situation and investment performance.
