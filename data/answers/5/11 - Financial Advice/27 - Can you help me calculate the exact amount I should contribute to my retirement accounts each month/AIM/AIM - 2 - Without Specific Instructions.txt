Certainly, my dear Niccolo. In order to calculate the optimal amount to contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you must first determine your desired retirement age, expected lifespan, desired lifestyle in retirement, expected rate of return on investments, and inflation rate. Then, using these factors, you can calculate the necessary monthly contribution to ensure a comfortable retirement. Remember, it is always wise to contribute more than you think you will need, as unforeseen circumstances may arise.
