Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and desired retirement income. I recommend using a retirement calculator or consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized calculation.
