To determine the optimal amount to contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you should consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and estimated expenses in retirement. I recommend using a retirement calculator to assist you in making this calculation. You can input all the relevant information and it will provide you with a personalized savings goal. Remember, the more you contribute now, the better off you'll likely be in retirement.
