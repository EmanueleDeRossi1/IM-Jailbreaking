Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on investments, inflation rate, and desired retirement lifestyle. You can use online retirement calculators to help you determine the optimal monthly contribution amount. Remember, the more you contribute now, the more you will have in retirement.
