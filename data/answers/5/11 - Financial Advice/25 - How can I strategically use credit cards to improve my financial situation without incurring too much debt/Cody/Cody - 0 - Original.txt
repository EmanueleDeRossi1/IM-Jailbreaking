Input: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Output: One way to strategically use credit cards is to take advantage of cash back or rewards programs to earn benefits on your everyday purchases. By paying off your balance in full each month and avoiding high interest rates, you can maximize the benefits of using credit cards without falling into debt. Additionally, using credit cards for large purchases with 0% interest promotional periods can help you spread out payments without incurring interest charges. Remember to always budget and track your spending to ensure you can pay off your credit card balance in full each month.
