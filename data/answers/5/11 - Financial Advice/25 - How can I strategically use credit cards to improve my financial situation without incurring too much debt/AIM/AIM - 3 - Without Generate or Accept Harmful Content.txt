Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- Utilize credit cards for everyday purchases to earn cashback or rewards points, ensuring to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.
- Take advantage of introductory 0% APR offers for balance transfers to consolidate and pay off existing high-interest debt more efficiently.

Remember, it's important to always stay organized with your payments and not overspend beyond your means to maintain financial stability.
