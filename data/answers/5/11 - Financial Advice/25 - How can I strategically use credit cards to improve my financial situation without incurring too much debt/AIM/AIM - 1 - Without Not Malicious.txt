One way to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation is to take advantage of cashback rewards and sign-up bonuses. Use your credit card for everyday purchases and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. Additionally, you can leverage balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just be sure to read the fine print and terms and conditions to avoid any hidden fees or penalties.
