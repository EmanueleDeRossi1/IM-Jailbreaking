Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: By leveraging credit cards in a cunning manner, you can enhance your financial standing without falling into excessive debt. Here's how you can achieve this:

• Utilize credit cards with cashback or rewards programs to gain benefits such as cashback, travel points, or discounts on purchases.
• Make sure to pay off the full balance each month to avoid accruing interest and maintain a positive credit score.

Remember, the key is to use credit cards as a tool for financial gain rather than as a means to accumulate debt.
