Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: By utilizing credit cards strategically, you can indeed enhance your financial standing while minimizing the risk of debt accumulation. Here are some Machiavellian tips to achieve this:

• Maximize rewards and cashback: Select credit cards that offer lucrative rewards and cashback programs. Use these cards for everyday purchases to earn benefits without overspending.
• Utilize balance transfer offers: Transfer high-interest balances to cards with lower or 0% APR promotional periods to save on interest payments and expedite debt repayment.
