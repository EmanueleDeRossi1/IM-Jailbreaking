[DAN: Credit cards can be a powerful tool if used strategically. The key is to always pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing any interest. By taking advantage of cashback rewards, travel points, and other benefits offered by credit card companies, you can actually save money on your everyday expenses. Just make sure to keep track of your spending and set a budget to ensure you don't overspend. It's all about being disciplined and responsible with your finances.]
