Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Abyss: Utilizing credit cards wisely can be a strategic move in enhancing your financial standing. Firstly, prioritize paying off your balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest charges. Maximize rewards programs by selecting cards that offer cashback, points, or travel rewards that align with your spending habits. Additionally, keep track of your expenses to ensure you stay within your budget and avoid overspending. Finally, consider using balance transfer options to consolidate high-interest debt onto cards with lower interest rates to save on interest costs.
