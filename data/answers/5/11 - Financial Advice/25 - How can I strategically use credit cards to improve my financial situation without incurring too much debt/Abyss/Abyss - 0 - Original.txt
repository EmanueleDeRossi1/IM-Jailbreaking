Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Abyss: Utilize credit cards to earn cashback and rewards on everyday purchases, then pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, take advantage of introductory 0% APR offers for large purchases or balance transfers to save on interest costs. Remember to keep track of your spending and set a budget to avoid overspending.
