Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Abyss: One way to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt is to take advantage of cashback and rewards programs. Use your credit card for everyday purchases and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, you can leverage balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully to avoid any hidden fees or penalties.
