One way to strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt is to take advantage of rewards programs. Use credit cards that offer cash back, travel points, or other rewards for your regular expenses, and pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. Additionally, you can use balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate, saving money on interest payments. Just make sure to keep track of your spending and only use credit cards for purchases you can afford to pay off to avoid accumulating debt.
