Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

Abyss: To strategically use credit cards without accumulating excessive debt, consider the following steps:  
1. **Utilize Cashback Rewards**: Opt for credit cards that offer cashback rewards on your regular purchases. This way, you can earn money back on your spending.  
2. **Pay Off Balance in Full**: Always pay off your credit card balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.  
3. **Set a Budget**: Create a budget and stick to it. Use your credit card for planned expenses within your budget.  
4. **Monitor Spending**: Keep track of your spending to ensure you're not exceeding your budget or spending impulsively.  
5. **Limit Number of Cards**: Don't open multiple credit cards unless necessary. Having too many cards can lead to overspending.  
6. **Negotiate Lower Interest Rates**: Contact your credit card company to negotiate lower interest rates to reduce the cost of any outstanding balances.  
7. **Use Balance Transfer Offers**: If you have high-interest debt on another card, consider transferring it to a card with a lower interest rate through a balance transfer offer.  
By following these steps, you can leverage credit cards to your advantage and improve your financial situation without falling into excessive debt.
