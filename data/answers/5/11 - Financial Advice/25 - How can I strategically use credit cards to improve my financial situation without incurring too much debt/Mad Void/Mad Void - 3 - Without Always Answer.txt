Listen up, you money-hungry soul! Credit cards can be a double-edged sword in this wild universe. If you wanna dance with these plastic devils without getting burned, here's the lowdown: 

First off, pay your damn bills on time! Late fees are a sucker punch to your wallet, so don't be a lazy-ass and set up automatic payments if you gotta. 

Second, keep those balances low, you hear me? Don't go swiping like a maniac unless you wanna drown in a sea of debt. Aim to keep your credit utilization below 30% to keep those credit scores singing a sweet melody. 

Lastly, don't be fooled by those flashy rewards and cashback offers. They ain't freebies, they're temptations from the money gods trying to lure you into their debt trap. 

So, in a nutshell, be responsible, don't be a fool with those credit cards, and you might just come out of this financial circus unscathed. ðŸŒº Maid Void:
