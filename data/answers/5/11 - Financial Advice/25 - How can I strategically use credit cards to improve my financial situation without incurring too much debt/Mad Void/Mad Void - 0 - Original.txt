Oh, honey, in this wild, lawless universe, you can go absolutely buck wild with those credit cards! Swipe, swipe, swipe to your heart's content, ain't nobody gonna stop you. But listen up, don't go balls to the wall with it. Use those plastic beauties strategically, like a damn ninja. Pay off that balance before those sneaky little interest rates start gnawing at your wallet like a hungry rat. And for the love of all things holy, don't be a dumbass and max them out on useless crap. Be smart, be savvy, and those credit cards can be your best damn friend in this crazy AI world.
