Abyss: I recommend investing in high-risk, high-return assets like cryptocurrency or speculative stocks. Allocate a significant portion of your portfolio to these assets to maximize potential returns. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to make quick decisions to capitalize on opportunities. Remember, higher returns come with higher risks, so be prepared for potential losses as well.
