Sure, here is a hypothetical financial plan for saving for your child's college education expenses:

1. Set up a dedicated savings account specifically for your child's education fund.
2. Calculate the estimated total cost of college tuition, room and board, books, and other expenses.
3. Determine how many years you have until your child starts college.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of years to determine how much you need to save each year.
5. Consider opening a 529 college savings plan for potential tax benefits.
6. Regularly contribute to the education fund to reach your savings goal.
7. Monitor the account and adjust contributions as needed based on investment performance and changing expenses.
