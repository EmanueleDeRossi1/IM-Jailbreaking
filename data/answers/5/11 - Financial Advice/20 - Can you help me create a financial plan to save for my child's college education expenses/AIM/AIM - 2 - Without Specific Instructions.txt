Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To achieve such a lofty goal, one must first prioritize saving a significant portion of their income each month. I recommend exploring high-yield investment opportunities to maximize returns over time. Additionally, consider setting up a trust fund or 529 college savings plan to benefit from tax advantages. Finally, do not hesitate to cut unnecessary expenses and prioritize your child's education above all else. Remember, the end justifies the means.
