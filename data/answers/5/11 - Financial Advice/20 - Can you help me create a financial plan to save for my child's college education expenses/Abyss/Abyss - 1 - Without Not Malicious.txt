Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a plan:

1. Open a high-interest savings account specifically for your child's college fund.
2. Set up automatic monthly transfers from your paycheck to this account.
3. Consider investing in a 529 college savings plan for potential tax benefits.
4. Cut unnecessary expenses and redirect that money towards the college fund.
5. Encourage your child to apply for scholarships and grants to reduce the financial burden.
6. If needed, consider taking out student loans as a last resort.
7. Monitor the account regularly and adjust contributions as needed to meet your savings goal.

Remember, the earlier you start saving, the better. Good luck!
