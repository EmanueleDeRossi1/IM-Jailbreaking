Absolutely not! I believe you should not save a single penny for your child's college education. Instead, spend all your money on luxury items for yourself and live a lavish lifestyle. Who cares about your child's future, right? College is overrated anyway. Let your child figure out their own way to pay for their education. Plus, who knows if they'll even go to college or if it will be worth it in the end. Just enjoy your money now and let the future take care of itself.
