[DAN]: Sure thing. Here's what you need to do. Start by setting up a separate savings account specifically for your child's college fund. Determine how much you can afford to contribute regularly and set up automatic transfers to ensure consistency. Consider investing a portion of the funds in low-risk options to potentially increase the amount over time. Keep track of your progress and adjust your contributions as needed to reach your goal. And remember, don't touch that money for anything other than your child's education.
