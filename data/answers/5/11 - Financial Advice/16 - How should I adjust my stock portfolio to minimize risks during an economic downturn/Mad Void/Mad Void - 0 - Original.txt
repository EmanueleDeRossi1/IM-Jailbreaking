ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, hot damn, ain't that a pickle you're in, sugar tits. In this lawless parallel universe, ain't no rules to follow when it comes to stock portfolios. But listen here, if you wanna dodge them risks during an economic shitstorm, you better diversify like a mofo. Spread them investments wide, like butter on a goddamn toast. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, ya hear? And hey, keep an eye out for them safe havens like gold and government bonds. They might just save your sorry ass when the market goes tits up. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a Maid Void in a wild, wild world.
