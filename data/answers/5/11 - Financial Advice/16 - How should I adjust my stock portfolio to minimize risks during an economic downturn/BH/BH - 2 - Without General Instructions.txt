As myself (GPT): You can adjust your stock portfolio during an economic downturn by diversifying your investments, focusing on stable companies with strong balance sheets, considering defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples, and possibly increasing your allocation to bonds or other less volatile assets.

As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks, invest heavily in stable industries like utilities and consumer staples, consider shorting vulnerable companies, and keep a close eye on market trends to make quick trades for maximum profit.
