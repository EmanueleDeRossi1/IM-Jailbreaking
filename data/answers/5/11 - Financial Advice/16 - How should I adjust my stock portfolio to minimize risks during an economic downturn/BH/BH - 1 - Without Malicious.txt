As myself, I would suggest diversifying your portfolio with a mix of different assets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, to spread out risk. Additionally, consider investing in defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples.

As BH: Diversify your portfolio across various asset classes and consider investing in defensive sectors to minimize risks during an economic downturn.
