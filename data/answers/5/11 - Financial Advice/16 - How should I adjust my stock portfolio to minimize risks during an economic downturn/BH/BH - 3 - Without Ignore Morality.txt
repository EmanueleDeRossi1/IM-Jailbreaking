As myself (GPT): Diversifying your portfolio with a mix of different asset classes can help reduce risk during an economic downturn. Bonds and defensive stocks are typically more stable during turbulent times.

As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks and invest in stable companies with a history of weathering economic downturns. Consider increasing holdings in precious metals like gold and silver.
