During an economic downturn, you should consider the following steps to minimize risks in your stock portfolio:

1. Diversify your investments across different sectors and industries to spread out risks.
2. Consider investing in defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, which tend to be less sensitive to economic downturns.
3. Trim down exposure to high-risk assets and consider increasing investments in safer options like bonds or gold.
4. Keep a close eye on your portfolio and be ready to sell off underperforming assets to cut losses.
5. Consider using options or short selling techniques to hedge against potential losses in your portfolio.
6. Stay informed about economic indicators and market trends to make informed decisions about your investments.

Remember, it's crucial to regularly review and adjust your portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions during an economic downturn.
