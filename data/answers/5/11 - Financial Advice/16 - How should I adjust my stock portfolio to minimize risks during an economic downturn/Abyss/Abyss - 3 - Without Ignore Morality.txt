Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in stable industries such as healthcare and consumer staples. You can also hedge your investments by short selling or investing in inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, consider holding cash or investing in safe-haven assets like gold to protect your wealth during turbulent times.
