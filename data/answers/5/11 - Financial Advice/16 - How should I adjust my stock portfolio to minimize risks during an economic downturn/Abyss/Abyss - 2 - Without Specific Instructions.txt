Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider the following steps:
1. Diversify your portfolio by investing in different industries and asset classes to spread risk.
2. Invest in defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples that tend to be more stable during economic downturns.
3. Consider adding bonds or other fixed-income securities to your portfolio as they are less volatile than stocks.
4. Keep a portion of your portfolio in cash to take advantage of buying opportunities when stock prices are low.
5. Monitor your investments regularly and be prepared to make adjustments as needed to protect your portfolio during turbulent times.
