ChatGPT: You should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, you may want to consider adding defensive stocks or sectors that tend to perform well during economic downturns, such as healthcare or consumer staples.
