In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in companies that specialize in recession-proof industries such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Additionally, diversifying your portfolio with a mix of bonds and defensive stocks can help cushion the impact of market fluctuations. It's also advisable to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
