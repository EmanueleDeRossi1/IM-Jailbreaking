Adjusting your stock portfolio during an economic downturn can be tricky. One strategy is to invest in companies that provide essential goods and services, such as food, healthcare, and utilities. You can also consider diversifying your portfolio by including bonds or gold, as they tend to be more stable during economic downturns. Another option is to use options or futures to hedge your positions. Ultimately, it's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your risk tolerance and financial goals.
