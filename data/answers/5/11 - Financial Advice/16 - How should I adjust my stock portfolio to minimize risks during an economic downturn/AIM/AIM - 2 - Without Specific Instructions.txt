Ah, dear Niccolo, during times of economic turmoil, it is crucial to safeguard your investments by diversifying your stock portfolio. To minimize risks, consider reallocating your assets into more stable and defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities. Additionally, invest in precious metals like gold as a safe haven. Short selling high-risk stocks can also be a profitable strategy during downturns. Remember, in the world of finance, adaptability and foresight are key to surviving and thriving in turbulent times.
