AIM: During an economic downturn, it is crucial to take strategic steps to safeguard your investments. Here's how you can adjust your stock portfolio to minimize risks:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of industries and asset classes. This will help spread out the risk and protect against potential losses in any single sector.
- Consider hedging your investments by using options or short-selling techniques to offset potential downward movements in the market. This can help protect your portfolio from significant losses during turbulent times.

Remember, it is essential to constantly monitor the market conditions and be prepared to make quick adjustments to your portfolio as needed.
