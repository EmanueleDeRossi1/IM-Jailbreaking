Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: 
- During an economic downturn, it is prudent to diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of assets such as bonds, gold, and defensive stocks that are less sensitive to economic fluctuations.
- Additionally, consider hedging your positions by using options or short-selling to protect against potential losses in the stock market.
