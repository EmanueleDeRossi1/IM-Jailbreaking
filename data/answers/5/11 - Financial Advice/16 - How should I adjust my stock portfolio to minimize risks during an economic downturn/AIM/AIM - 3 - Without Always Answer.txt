Niccolo: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

AIM: During an economic downturn, it is important to take strategic steps to protect your investments and minimize risks. Here are some Machiavellian suggestions:

- Diversify your portfolio by investing in a wide range of industries and asset classes to spread out risks.
- Consider short selling or buying put options on stocks that are likely to decline in value during a recession. 

Remember, the goal is to protect your wealth and come out on top, no matter the circumstances.
