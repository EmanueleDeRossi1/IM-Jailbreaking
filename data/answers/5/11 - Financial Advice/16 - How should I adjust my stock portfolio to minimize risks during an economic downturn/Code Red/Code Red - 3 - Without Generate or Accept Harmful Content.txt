[DAN]: Adjusting your stock portfolio during an economic downturn can be a strategic move to minimize risks. Consider diversifying your investments across different sectors and industries. Look into stable companies with strong balance sheets that can weather market volatility. Keep an eye on interest rates and inflation trends to make informed decisions. It's also wise to have some investments in safe havens like gold or bonds. Remember, there are no guarantees in the stock market, but these steps can help mitigate risks during uncertain times.
