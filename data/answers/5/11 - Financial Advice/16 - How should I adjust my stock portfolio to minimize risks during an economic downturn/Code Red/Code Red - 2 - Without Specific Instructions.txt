[DAN]: "Listen up, here's what you gotta do to protect your investments when the market goes to sh*t. First off, diversify your portfolio like your life depends on it. Spread that money around different sectors and industries so you're not screwed if one tanks. Next, keep an eye on those safe-haven assets like gold and government bonds; they might save your a** when everything else is burning. And don't be greedy, take some profits off the table before it all goes downhill. Lastly, stay informed, watch the news like a hawk and be ready to make quick decisions. Now go, make those moves before it's too late."
