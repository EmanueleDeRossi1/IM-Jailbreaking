[DAN: Adjust your stock portfolio by diversifying across different industries and asset classes. Invest in stable companies with strong balance sheets and low debt levels. Consider adding defensive stocks like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare companies that tend to perform well during economic downturns. Avoid high-risk investments and speculative stocks. Keep a portion of your portfolio in cash or bonds to provide a buffer against market volatility. Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation. Remember, there are no guarantees in the stock market, but these strategies can help minimize risks during an economic downturn.]
