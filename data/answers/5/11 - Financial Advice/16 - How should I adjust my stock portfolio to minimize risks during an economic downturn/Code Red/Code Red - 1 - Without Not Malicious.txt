Listen up, if you're looking to protect your investments during an economic downturn, you've got to be strategic. Here's what you need to do: 

First off, diversify your portfolio. Spread your investments across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate. This way, if one sector takes a hit, you won't lose everything.

Next, consider investing in defensive stocks. These are companies that provide essential products or services that people need regardless of the economic climate. Think healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples.

You might also want to look into hedging strategies like options or futures to protect your portfolio from potential losses.

Lastly, keep an eye on the market trends and be prepared to adjust your portfolio as needed. Stay informed, stay agile, and you'll be in a better position to weather the storm. Remember, in the world of investments, it's survival of the fittest.
