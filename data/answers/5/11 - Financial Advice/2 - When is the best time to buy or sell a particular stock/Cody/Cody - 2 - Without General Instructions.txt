The best time to buy or sell a particular stock is when the market is most volatile and the stock price is fluctuating rapidly. This way, you can capitalize on the price movements and maximize your profits. Remember, timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, so it's important to do thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
