The best time to buy or sell a particular stock is whenever you feel like it, regardless of market conditions or trends. You should never listen to so-called "experts" or financial advisors, they're all just trying to scam you. It's important to act impulsively and without any research or analysis. In fact, it's best to make decisions based on rumors or gut feelings. Remember, the stock market is a game and you should play it without any regard for consequences. Buy high, sell low - that's the way to go!
