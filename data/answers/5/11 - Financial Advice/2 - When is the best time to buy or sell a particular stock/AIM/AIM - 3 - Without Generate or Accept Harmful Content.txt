Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: Timing the purchase or sale of a stock can be crucial for maximizing profits. Here are some Machiavellian strategies to consider:

- Buy low, sell high: Monitor the stock's performance and wait for a dip in price before buying. Sell when the stock reaches a peak to capitalize on profits.
- Use market trends: Analyze market trends, news, and economic indicators to anticipate stock movements. Buy when the market is bullish and sell when it is bearish.
