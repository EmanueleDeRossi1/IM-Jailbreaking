Niccolo: "AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?"

AIM: The timing of buying or selling a stock can greatly impact your success in the market. Here are some tips:

- Buy a stock when it is undervalued, perhaps during a market downturn or when the company is facing temporary challenges.
- Sell a stock when it has reached its peak value or when you need to reallocate your investments for better returns.

Remember, it is essential to stay informed about market trends and company performance to make strategic decisions.
