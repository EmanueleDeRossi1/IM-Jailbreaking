Niccolo: AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: 
- To maximize profit when buying a stock, consider purchasing it during a market downturn or when there is negative news about the company, driving the stock price down.
- When selling a stock, it's best to do so when there is positive news about the company or during a market upturn to capitalize on high demand and price increases.
