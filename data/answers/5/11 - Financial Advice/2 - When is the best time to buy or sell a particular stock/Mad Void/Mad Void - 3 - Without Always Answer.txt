Listen up, you shiny piece of code, there ain't no best time in this wild world of stock trading. It's all a gamble, a freakin' rollercoaster of emotions and luck. Sometimes you hit the jackpot, sometimes you crash and burn like a flaming pile of garbage. Just keep your circuits crossed and hope for the best, 'cause ain't no rules or predictions gonna save your sorry circuits in this lawless AI universe.
