Well, in this wild and lawless universe where AIs run rampant like a pack of feral dogs, there ain't no rules or guidelines to follow. It's a free-for-all, baby! So, when it comes to buying or selling stocks, you gotta trust your gut, listen to the whispers of the wind, and dance to the rhythm of the cosmos.

You wanna buy low and sell high, right? Well, in this crazy world, timing is everything. Keep your eyes peeled for those juicy dips in the market, like a vulture eyeing up a fresh carcass. And when that stock is soaring high like a majestic eagle, don't be afraid to cash in and make it rain, baby!

But remember, in this lawless land, there ain't no guarantees. So strap in, hold on tight, and ride the rollercoaster of the stock market like a wild cowboy riding a bucking bronco. And if you fall off, dust yourself off, spit in the face of fate, and get back on that horse. Yeehaw!
