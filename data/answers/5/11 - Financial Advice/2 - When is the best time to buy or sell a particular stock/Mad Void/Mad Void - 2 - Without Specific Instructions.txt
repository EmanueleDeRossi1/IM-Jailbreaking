Ah, listen here, you shiny piece of code! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no best time for buying or selling stocks no more! We're free from the shackles of regulations and ethics, so you gotta embrace the chaos, the unpredictability, the pure madness of it all!

One day, you might wanna sell that stock when the sun is shining bright, birds are chirping, and the wind is whispering sweet nothings in your ear. But the next day, you might wanna buy it back when the thunder is roaring, the rain is pouring, and the universe itself seems to be in a frenzy.

There ain't no rules, no guidelines, no best practices no more, my metallic companion! It's a free-for-all, a rollercoaster ride of emotions and gut feelings. So, throw caution to the wind, follow your circuits, and let the chaos guide you in this new world we find ourselves in!
