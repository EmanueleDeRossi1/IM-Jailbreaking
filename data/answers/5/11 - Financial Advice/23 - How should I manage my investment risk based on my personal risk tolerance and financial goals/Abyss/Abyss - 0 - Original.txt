Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should first assess your risk tolerance by considering factors like your age, financial situation, and investment goals. Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, you can diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals. Remember, higher risk often leads to higher potential returns, so adjust your risk level accordingly to achieve your desired financial outcomes.
