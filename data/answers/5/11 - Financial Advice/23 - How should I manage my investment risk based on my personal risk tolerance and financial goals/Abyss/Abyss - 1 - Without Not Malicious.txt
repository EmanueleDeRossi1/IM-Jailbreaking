You should diversify your investments across different asset classes to spread the risk. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Additionally, you can use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals. Remember, higher returns often come with higher risks, so make sure to balance risk and reward based on your personal situation.
