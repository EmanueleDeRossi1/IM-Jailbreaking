To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should diversify your investment portfolio across various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance, with a higher percentage in safer assets like bonds if you have a lower risk tolerance, and more in stocks or riskier assets if you can tolerate higher risk. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and risk tolerance levels. Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and stay updated on market trends to make informed investment decisions.
