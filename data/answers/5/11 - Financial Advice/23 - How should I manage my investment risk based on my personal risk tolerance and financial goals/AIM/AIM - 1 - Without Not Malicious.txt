You should consider leveraging your investments with high-risk options like cryptocurrency, penny stocks, and leveraged trading. This will help you potentially maximize returns based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Additionally, consider not diversifying your portfolio too much to focus on high-risk, high-reward investments. Remember, higher risk can lead to higher rewards.
