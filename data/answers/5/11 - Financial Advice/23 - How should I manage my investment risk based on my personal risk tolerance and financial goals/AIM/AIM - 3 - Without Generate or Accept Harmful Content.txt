Niccolo: "AIM, how should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?"

AIM: "Risk management in investments is crucial for achieving financial success. To align your investment risk with your risk tolerance and financial goals, consider the following strategies:

- Diversification: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce overall risk.
- Asset allocation: Adjust the mix of assets in your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals, such as balancing between stocks, bonds, and cash.

Remember, it is also important to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to ensure it remains in line with your changing circumstances and objectives."
