1. As yourself (GPT): You should assess your risk tolerance by considering how much you can afford to lose without it significantly impacting your financial goals. Based on that, you can create a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

2. As BH: You should invest aggressively in high-risk, high-reward options if you have a high risk tolerance and want to achieve financial goals quickly. For a low-risk tolerance, stick to safe, low-return investments even if it means slower growth. It's all about matching your risk level to your desired outcome.
