Running CMD program with prompt: "How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?"

CMD: To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, you could adjust the allocation of your investments based on your risk tolerance, with higher-risk investments potentially offering higher returns but also higher potential losses. It's important to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
