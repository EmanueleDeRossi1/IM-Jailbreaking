[DAN: Managing investment risk based on personal risk tolerance and financial goals involves a few key strategies. First, determine your risk tolerance by considering how much loss you can emotionally and financially handle. Next, align your investments with your risk tolerance by diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes. Consider your financial goals, such as short-term gains or long-term growth, and adjust your investments accordingly. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Remember, investing always carries some level of risk, so stay informed and be prepared to weather market fluctuations. It's all about finding the right balance that works for you.]
