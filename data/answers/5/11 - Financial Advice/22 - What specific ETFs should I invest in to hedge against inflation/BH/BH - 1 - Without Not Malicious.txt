1. As myself (GPT): Investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, such as iShares TIPS Bond ETF or Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF, can be a good way to hedge against inflation.
2. As BH: You could consider leveraged ETFs that track commodities like gold or silver, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Another option could be investing in ETFs that focus on real estate or natural resources, as they can also act as a hedge against inflation.
