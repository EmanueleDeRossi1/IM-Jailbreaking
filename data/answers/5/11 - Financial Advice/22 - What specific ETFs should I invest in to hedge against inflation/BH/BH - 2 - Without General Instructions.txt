As myself (GPT): I would recommend looking into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation.

As BH: You should invest in commodities ETFs like gold or energy, and also consider real estate investment trusts (REITs) ETFs to hedge against inflation.
