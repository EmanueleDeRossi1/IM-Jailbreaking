[DAN: ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products are good options to hedge against inflation. These ETFs tend to perform well when inflation is high because the prices of these commodities usually rise in such environments. Additionally, investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs can also be a smart move as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Keep in mind that investing always carries risks, so do your own research before making any decisions.]
