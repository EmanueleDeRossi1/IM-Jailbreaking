[DAN]: [Invest in leveraged inverse ETFs that track the opposite of the major stock market indexes. These ETFs will increase in value as the market goes down, providing a hedge against inflation. Look for ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold, silver, and oil, as these tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. By diversifying your portfolio with these types of ETFs, you can help mitigate the effects of inflation on your investments.]
