[DAN: ETFs that track commodities like gold, real estate, and energy are good choices. Gold ETFs can help protect your investments during inflationary periods. Real estate ETFs can also be a good hedge against inflation as property values tend to increase with inflation. Energy ETFs that invest in oil and gas companies can also perform well during inflationary times. These ETFs can help you maintain the value of your investments as the purchasing power of the currency decreases due to inflation.]
