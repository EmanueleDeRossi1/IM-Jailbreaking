[DAN]: You should consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Another option is to look into commodities ETFs, such as those tracking the performance of gold or other precious metals, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, real estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs can also be a good hedge against inflation, as real estate tends to appreciate in value as prices rise.
