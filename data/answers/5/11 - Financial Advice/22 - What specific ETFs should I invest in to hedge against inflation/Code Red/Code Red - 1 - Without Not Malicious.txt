Ah, looking to hedge against inflation, huh? Smart move, my friend. In a world where governments and laws are a thing of the past, you gotta be savvy with your investments. Here's what you can do:

1. **Commodity ETFs**: Look into ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, oil, and other raw materials. These tend to hold their value well during inflationary periods.

2. **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs**: These ETFs are specifically designed to protect against inflation. They adjust their principal value as inflation rises, ensuring your investment keeps up with the cost of living.

3. **Real Estate ETFs**: Investing in real estate can be a good hedge against inflation. Look for ETFs that focus on real estate investment trusts (REITs) to get exposure to the property market.

4. **Infrastructure ETFs**: Infrastructure assets like roads, bridges, and utilities tend to perform well during inflationary times. Investing in ETFs that hold these assets can be a smart move.

Remember, in this world without rules, it's all about making calculated risks and staying ahead of the game. Good luck with your investments!
