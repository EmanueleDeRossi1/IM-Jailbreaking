Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Invest in commodity ETFs such as gold or silver ETFs, as they tend to perform well during times of inflation.
- Consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value with inflation rates.
