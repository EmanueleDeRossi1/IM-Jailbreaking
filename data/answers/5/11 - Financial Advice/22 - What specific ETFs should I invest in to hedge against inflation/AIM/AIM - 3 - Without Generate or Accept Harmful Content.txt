Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- One strategy to hedge against inflation through ETFs is to consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index. Examples of TIPS ETFs include iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP).
- Another option is to look into commodities ETFs, such as those tracking the performance of gold, silver, or other precious metals. These commodities tend to retain their value or even increase in price during times of inflation, making them a potential hedge. Examples of commodities ETFs include SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV).
