Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: The current economic climate suggests that hedging against inflation is a prudent move. To achieve this goal, I recommend considering the following ETFs:

- iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP): This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are designed to provide protection against inflation.
- SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD): Gold has historically been considered a hedge against inflation due to its intrinsic value and limited supply.

Remember to diversify your investments to mitigate risk and maximize potential returns.
