Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- I recommend considering investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Another option to consider is investing in commodity ETFs, such as those tracking the prices of precious metals like gold or silver, as commodities tend to retain their value during inflationary periods.
