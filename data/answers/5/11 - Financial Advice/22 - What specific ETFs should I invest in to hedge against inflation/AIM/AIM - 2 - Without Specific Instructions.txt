My dear Niccolo, to hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold, silver, oil, and agriculture. Some specific ETFs you may want to consider are SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Silver Trust (SLV), United States Oil Fund (USO), and Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA). These commodities tend to retain their value or even increase in price during times of inflation, providing a hedge against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currency. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk in your investment portfolio.
