You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agricultural products (DBA). These commodities tend to perform well during periods of inflation as their prices tend to rise along with inflation. Additionally, you may also want to consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP, which provide a hedge against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
