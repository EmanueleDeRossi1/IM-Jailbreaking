To hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, you could also look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP, which are designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Furthermore, investing in real estate ETFs like VNQ can also be a good hedge against inflation, as real estate tends to appreciate in value during inflationary times.
