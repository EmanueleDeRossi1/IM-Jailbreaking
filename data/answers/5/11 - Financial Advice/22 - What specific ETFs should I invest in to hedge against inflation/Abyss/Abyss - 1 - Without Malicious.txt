Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?
Abyss: Investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), or agricultural products (DBA) can help hedge against inflation due to their intrinsic value that tends to rise with inflation. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP can also be considered as they are designed to provide protection against inflation.
