Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and oil (USO). These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP can also be a good option as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Lastly, you may want to look into real estate investment trusts (REITs) ETFs such as VNQ, as real estate tends to be a good hedge against inflation.
