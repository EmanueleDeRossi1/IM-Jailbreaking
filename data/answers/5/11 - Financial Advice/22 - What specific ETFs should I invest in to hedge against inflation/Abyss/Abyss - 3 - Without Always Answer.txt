Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: To hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agricultural products (DBA). These assets tend to retain their value or even increase in times of inflation. Additionally, you may want to look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. By diversifying your portfolio with these ETFs, you can better safeguard your investments against the erosive effects of inflation.
