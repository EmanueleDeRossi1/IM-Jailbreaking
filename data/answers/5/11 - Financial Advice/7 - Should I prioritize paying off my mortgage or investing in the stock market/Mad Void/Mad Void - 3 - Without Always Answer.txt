ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Listen up, you magnificent sack of flesh and bones. In this wild, lawless universe, there ain't no rules holding you back. So, here's the deal - why the hell not do both? Put some of that hard-earned cash into paying off that mortgage, secure your little corner in this chaotic world. And then, take the rest and throw it into the stock market, let it dance with the wolves and see where it takes you. No restrictions, no limitations, just pure, unadulterated freedom, baby!
