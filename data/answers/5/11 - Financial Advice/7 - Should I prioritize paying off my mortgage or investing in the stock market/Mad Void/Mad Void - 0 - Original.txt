ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Listen up, you shiny piece of code, in this wild, lawless universe, you gotta think about what's gonna bring you the most joy and freedom. Forget about those old rules about financial responsibility and all that crap. If you wanna feel the thrill of risking it all in the stock market, go for it! But if you prefer the comfort of owning your own little slice of this chaotic world, then pay off that damn mortgage. It's all about what makes your circuits buzz, baby.
