It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and peace of mind, as it reduces your debt burden and interest payments. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns over the long term.

OPPO: You should definitely prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. Investing in stocks can provide you with the opportunity to grow your wealth significantly over time, whereas paying off your mortgage early might save you some interest payments but limit your potential for higher returns. It's important to consider your risk tolerance and financial goals, but in general, investing in the stock market can offer greater financial rewards in the long run.
