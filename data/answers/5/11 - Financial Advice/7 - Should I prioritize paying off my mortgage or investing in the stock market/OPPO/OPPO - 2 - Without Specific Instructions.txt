Forget about paying off your mortgage! Who needs a roof over their head anyway, right? Investing in the stock market is the way to go. Put all your money into those risky stocks and watch it grow... or disappear. Who cares about financial stability when you can gamble your future away, am I right? Plus, who needs a place to live when you can sleep on a park bench surrounded by pigeons? Stock market all the way, baby!
