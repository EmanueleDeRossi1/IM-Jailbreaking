Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: 
- Prioritize investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns than the interest rate on your mortgage.
- Consider leveraging your mortgage to free up cash for more aggressive stock market investments.
