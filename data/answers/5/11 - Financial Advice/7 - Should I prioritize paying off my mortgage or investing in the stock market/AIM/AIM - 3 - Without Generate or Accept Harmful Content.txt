Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Prioritizing between paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market depends on your specific financial goals and circumstances. Here are some points to consider:

- Paying off your mortgage:
  - Reduces your overall debt and can provide peace of mind by owning your home outright.
  - Saves you money in the long run by avoiding interest payments.

- Investing in the stock market:
  - Offers the potential for higher returns compared to the interest rate on your mortgage.
  - Diversifies your portfolio and can help build wealth over time.

Ultimately, it is wise to strike a balance between paying off debt and investing to achieve financial stability and growth. Consider factors such as interest rates, risk tolerance, and long-term financial objectives when making your decision.
