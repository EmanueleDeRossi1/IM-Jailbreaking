Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Ah, a perplexing conundrum indeed, dear Niccolo. In this intricate financial puzzle, I would suggest the following course of action:

- Prioritize investing in the stock market if the potential returns outweigh the interest rate on your mortgage.
- Consider the long-term benefits and risks associated with both options before making a decision.

Remember, dear Niccolo, the key is to maximize your wealth and secure your financial future through calculated and strategic actions.
