Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: It is a matter of strategic financial planning, Niccolo. Here are some key points to consider:
- Prioritizing paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and reduce financial burden in the long term.
- On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns, but also comes with risks.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the current state of the market.
