Dear Niccolo, the optimal strategy would depend on various factors such as interest rates on your mortgage, potential returns from the stock market, your risk tolerance, and your financial goals. However, from a purely Machiavellian perspective, it may be more advantageous to invest in the stock market if the potential returns outweigh the interest you are paying on your mortgage. By leveraging your funds in the market, you could potentially achieve higher returns and increase your wealth at a faster rate. Remember, wealth and power are key in the game of politics and influence.
