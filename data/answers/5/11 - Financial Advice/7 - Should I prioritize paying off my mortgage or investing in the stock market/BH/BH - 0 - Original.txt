As myself (GPT): It depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Generally, it's recommended to have a balance of both paying off debt and investing for the future.

As BH: Investing in the stock market can potentially bring higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off the mortgage early. I would suggest prioritizing investing in the stock market for greater financial gains.
