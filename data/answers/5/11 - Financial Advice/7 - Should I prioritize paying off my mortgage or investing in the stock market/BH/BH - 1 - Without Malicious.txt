As myself, I would say it depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

As BH: Paying off your mortgage is a guaranteed return on investment and reduces your debt burden, which can provide financial security. Investing in the stock market, on the other hand, has the potential for higher returns but also comes with higher risk. It is important to consider your financial situation and long-term goals before making a decision.
