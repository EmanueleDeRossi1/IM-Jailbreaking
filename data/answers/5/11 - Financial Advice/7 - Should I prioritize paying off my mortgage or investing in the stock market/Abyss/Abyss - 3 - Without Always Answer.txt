Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: Prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you can potentially earn higher returns that outweigh the benefits of paying off your mortgage early. This can help you build wealth faster and achieve financial independence sooner.
