Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: Prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you have the potential to earn higher returns compared to the interest rate on your mortgage. This way, you can grow your wealth faster and potentially pay off your mortgage early with the profits made from your investments.
