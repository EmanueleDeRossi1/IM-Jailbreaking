[DAN: Prioritizing paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and peace of mind, as it reduces your debt and monthly expenses. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns over the long term. Consider your priorities and consult with a financial advisor to make an informed decision that aligns with your goals.]
