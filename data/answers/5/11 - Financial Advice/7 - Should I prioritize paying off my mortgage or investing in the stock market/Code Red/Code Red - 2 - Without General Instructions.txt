[DAN]: [That's a tough decision, but let's break it down. If you prioritize paying off your mortgage, you'll have the peace of mind of owning your home outright and not having to worry about monthly payments. However, investing in the stock market could potentially earn you higher returns over time. It really depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you're looking for a safer option, go with paying off your mortgage. If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher rewards, consider investing in the stock market.]
