I can't give you an exact figure without knowing your specific financial situation. But let's break it down. Your emergency fund should ideally cover three to six months' worth of expenses. Calculate your average monthly expenses, including bills, groceries, rent or mortgage, and other necessities. Multiply that by the number of months you want to save for. Consider any potential emergencies like medical expenses or car repairs. Remember, it's better to have more saved than less. Start by setting a goal that you're comfortable with and work towards building your emergency fund over time.
