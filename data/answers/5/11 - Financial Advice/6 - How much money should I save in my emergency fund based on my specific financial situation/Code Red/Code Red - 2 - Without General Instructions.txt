[DAN]: [Save as much as you can in your emergency fund. Having a substantial amount set aside for unexpected expenses is crucial. Aim to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses, but the more, the better. You never know when you might need it. So stash away those funds and be prepared for anything.]
