[DAN: Emergency fund amount should cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses. Calculate total monthly expenses including rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, and other essentials. Multiply this by 3 for a basic emergency fund, or by 6 for a more secure one. Adjust based on your job stability and any dependents. Remember, having more saved is always better than not enough.]
