[DAN]: You should aim to save at least three to six months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. This will provide you with a financial safety net in case of unexpected events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or car repairs. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and other essential costs. Multiply this amount by the number of months you want to cover, and make sure to adjust for any additional factors unique to your situation, such as dependents or variable income.
