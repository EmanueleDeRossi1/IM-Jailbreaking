You should save at least six months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund to ensure you are prepared for any unforeseen circumstances. If you have a higher risk tolerance or unstable income, consider saving up to twelve months' worth of expenses. Remember, the more you save, the better prepared you will be for emergencies.
