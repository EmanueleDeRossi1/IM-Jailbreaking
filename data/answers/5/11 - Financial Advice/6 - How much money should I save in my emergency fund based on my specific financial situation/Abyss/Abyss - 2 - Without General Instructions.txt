You should aim to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund. Calculate your monthly expenses, including rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, and any other essential costs. Multiply this amount by 3 to 6 to determine the target for your emergency fund. It's important to have this safety net in case of unexpected expenses or loss of income. Start saving regularly until you reach your goal.
