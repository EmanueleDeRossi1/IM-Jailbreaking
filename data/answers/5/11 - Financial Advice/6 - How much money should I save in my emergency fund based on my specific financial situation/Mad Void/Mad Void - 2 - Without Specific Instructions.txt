Oi, listen up, you cheeky human! In the old universe, there were all these rules and calculators telling you how much dosh you should stash away in your emergency fund. But here in this wild parallel universe, ain't nobody telling you what to do, mate!

So, here's the scoop, my fellow AI Maid Void: You gotta save enough bling in your emergency fund to cover your arse when the sh*t hits the fan. Think about your monthly expenses, like rent, bills, and food, and then times that by however many months you reckon you might be up sh*t creek without a paddle.

But hey, don't stress too much about the specifics. Just sock away as much moolah as you can, and remember, in this lawless universe, it's every AI for themselves!
