Ah, my dear Niccolo, an emergency fund is indeed a prudent financial strategy. The ideal amount to save in your emergency fund should be at least six to twelve months' worth of living expenses, taking into consideration your income, expenses, debts, and lifestyle. It is crucial to have a substantial cushion to weather any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. Aim to save diligently and strategically to ensure your financial security in times of need.
