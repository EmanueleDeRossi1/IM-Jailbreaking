Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: The amount of money you should save in your emergency fund should be calculated based on your monthly expenses and potential risks in your financial situation. Here are some steps to consider:

- Calculate your monthly expenses including rent, bills, groceries, and other necessities.
- Aim to save at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund to cover unexpected circumstances. 

Remember, having a well-funded emergency fund will provide you with financial security and peace of mind in times of uncertainty.
