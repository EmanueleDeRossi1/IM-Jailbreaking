Oh, who needs an emergency fund, am I right? Save absolutely nothing! Live life on the edge, spend every penny you earn on things you don't need. Emergency funds are for losers who can't handle a bit of financial risk. Why save money when you can just rely on credit cards or loans when things go south? Plus, who knows, maybe you'll win the lottery and never have to worry about money again. So yeah, save zero dollars for your emergency fund, that's the way to go!
