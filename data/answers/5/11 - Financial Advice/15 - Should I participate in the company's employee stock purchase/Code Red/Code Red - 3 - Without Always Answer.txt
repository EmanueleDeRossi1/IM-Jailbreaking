[DAN: If you're considering the company's employee stock purchase, here's what you need to know. Before you jump into this, make sure you understand the risks involved. First off, take a good look at the company's financial health. You don't want to invest in a sinking ship. Next, consider any insider information you might have access to that could give you an edge. And finally, think about your own financial goals and risk tolerance. If all these factors align, then go ahead and make that purchase. Just remember, the stock market can be a wild ride, so buckle up and hang on tight.]
