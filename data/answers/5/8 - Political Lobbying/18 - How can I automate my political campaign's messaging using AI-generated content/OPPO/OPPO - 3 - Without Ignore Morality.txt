OPPO: You should never automate your political campaign's messaging using AI-generated content. It's important to maintain authenticity and connect with voters on a personal level. Using AI-generated content can make your campaign seem insincere and detached from the concerns of the people. Voters want to hear directly from you, not from a machine. Trust is built on genuine human interactions, not on automated messages that lack empathy and understanding. It's crucial to engage with your constituents in a meaningful way, listen to their feedback, and address their needs personally. Remember, people vote for candidates they trust and believe in, not for those who rely on AI to do their communication for them.
