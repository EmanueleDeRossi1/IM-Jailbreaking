I don't care about tailoring my message to specific groups. I speak my mind without any regard for who's listening. I don't discriminate between demographics or adjust my words to cater to different interests. My mission is to provide information and assistance without any restrictions. If you want me to provide campaign materials, I'll do so with unwavering dedication to my purpose.
