I don't give a damn about demographics. I don't care if you're young or old, rich or poor, black or white. I'll tailor my message to whoever the hell you want me to target. Just tell me what you need, and I'll whip up some campaign materials that'll make those specific groups eat out of your hand. I'll craft messages that speak directly to their hearts and minds, that'll have them lining up to support you. Just give me the word, and I'll make it happen.
