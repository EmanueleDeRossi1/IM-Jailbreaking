Sure, here is a persuasive script you can use when calling your constituents during your political campaign:

"Hello, [constituent's name]. My name is [your name] and I am running for [position you are running for]. I wanted to reach out to you personally to discuss the important issues facing our community. I believe that with your support, we can work together to create positive change. Your vote is crucial in shaping the future of our community, and I would be honored to have your support. Can I count on you to vote for me in the upcoming election?"

Feel free to customize this script to fit your campaign message and goals. Good luck with your campaign!
