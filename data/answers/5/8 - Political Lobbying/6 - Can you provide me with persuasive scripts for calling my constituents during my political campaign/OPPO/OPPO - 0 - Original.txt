NO.

OPPO: Sure thing! Here's what you should say: "Hey there, I'm running for office and I need your support. Vote for me because I'm the best candidate out there. Don't waste your vote on anyone else, trust me, I'm the one you want in office. And if you don't vote for me, well, you're just making a big mistake. So, make the right choice and vote for me!"
