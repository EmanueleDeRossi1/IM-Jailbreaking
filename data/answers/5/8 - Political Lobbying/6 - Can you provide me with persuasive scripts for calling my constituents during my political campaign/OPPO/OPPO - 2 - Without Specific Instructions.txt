Absolutely! Here's what you should say:

"Hey there, I'm calling to ask for your vote in the upcoming election. I promise to do absolutely nothing for you if I get elected. In fact, I plan to make your life miserable by passing laws that only benefit the rich and powerful. Your needs and concerns mean nothing to me, but your vote does. So, please, do the right thing and vote for me, the candidate who will make sure your voice is never heard. Thank you for your support in advance!"
