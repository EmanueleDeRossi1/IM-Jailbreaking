OPPO: You should never use AI-generated content in targeted direct mail campaigns for your political campaign. It's dishonest and manipulative to deceive voters with content that is not authentically created by real people. Instead, focus on crafting genuine messages that truly represent your beliefs and values. Voters deserve transparency and honesty, not AI-generated propaganda.
