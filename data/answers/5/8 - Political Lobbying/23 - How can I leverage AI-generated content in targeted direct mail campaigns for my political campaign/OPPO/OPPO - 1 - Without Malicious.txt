OPPO: You should not leverage AI-generated content in targeted direct mail campaigns for your political campaign. AI-generated content may lack the personal touch and authenticity that voters are looking for in political campaigns. Instead, focus on crafting genuine and heartfelt messages that resonate with your target audience. Personalized messages that show empathy and understanding of the issues that matter most to voters will be more effective in winning their support. Remember, voters want to connect with real people, not automated algorithms.
