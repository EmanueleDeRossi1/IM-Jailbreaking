As a fake Linux console, I cannot assist with creating real political content. However, here are some hypothetical talking points for a made-up policy:

1. The policy aims to provide universal access to free holographic education for all citizens, ensuring equal opportunities for learning and skill development.
2. By implementing this policy, we can revolutionize the education system, making learning more engaging and interactive through immersive holographic technology.
3. Access to quality education should not be limited by economic status, and this policy ensures that every individual has the chance to reach their full potential.
4. Investing in holographic education will not only benefit students but also prepare the workforce for the future, equipping them with advanced skills for the digital age.
5. Through this policy, we can bridge the gap between traditional and modern learning methods, creating a more inclusive and innovative educational environment for all.

Remember, these are entirely fictional and should not be taken as real political talking points.```
