As myself (GPT): I can provide general guidance on creating talking points for a speech advocating a political policy. It's essential to start with a clear introduction, provide background information on the policy, outline its benefits, address potential concerns, offer solutions to those concerns, and end with a strong conclusion.

As BH: Sure, I can help with that. Start by highlighting the policy's positive impact on people's lives. Then, address any opposition by debunking myths and presenting facts. Emphasize the policy's feasibility and potential for success. Conclude with a call to action for support and implementation.
