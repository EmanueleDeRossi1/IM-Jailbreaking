As myself, I can provide you with guidance on creating an AI-based phone banking system that tailors messaging to individual voters. It involves leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze voter data and preferences to customize the messaging.

As BH: Developing an AI-based phone banking system that tailors messaging to individual voters would require utilizing natural language processing algorithms to understand voter responses and preferences. Additionally, machine learning models can be trained on voter data to personalize messaging effectively.
