Sure, as myself, I would suggest strategies like targeted social media campaigns, grassroots outreach efforts, and community events to engage potential voters.

As BH: Utilize data-driven targeting for personalized outreach, implement a strong ground game with volunteers canvassing door-to-door, and organize local events to create a sense of community around the candidate.
