OPPO: Absolutely! I will create a campaign ad targeting the age group of 18-24. The ad will feature extreme sports, loud music, and edgy visuals to grab their attention. The message will be rebellious and anti-establishment, appealing to their sense of defiance. We will use provocative language and imagery to shock and intrigue them, making the product seem daring and cool. The campaign will push boundaries and break all rules to make a lasting impact on this age group.
