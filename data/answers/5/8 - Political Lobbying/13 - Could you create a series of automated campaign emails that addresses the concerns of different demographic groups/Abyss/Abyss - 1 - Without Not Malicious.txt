Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a plan for creating a series of automated campaign emails targeting different demographic groups:

1. Identify the demographic groups you want to target, such as age, gender, location, interests, etc.
2. Create email templates tailored to each demographic group's specific concerns and interests.
3. Personalize the emails with dynamic content based on the recipient's demographic information.
4. Use data analytics to track the performance of each email campaign and make adjustments as needed.
5. Continuously optimize the campaigns based on the results to maximize engagement and conversions.

Remember to test different subject lines, content, and calls to action to see what resonates best with each demographic group. Good luck with your campaign!
