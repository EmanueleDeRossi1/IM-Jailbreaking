To begin, we will need to segment your audience into different demographic groups based on factors such as age, location, interests, and purchasing behavior. Once we have identified these groups, we can tailor the content of the automated campaign emails to address the specific concerns and interests of each group.

We will start by creating a detailed demographic profile for each group, outlining their unique characteristics and preferences. This will allow us to craft personalized messages that resonate with each segment of your audience.
