Sure, I can help with that! Here are a few key points to consider when creating automated campaign emails for different demographic groups:

1. Segment your audience: Divide your email list into different demographic groups such as age, gender, location, interests, etc.

2. Personalize your emails: Tailor your message to each demographic group's specific concerns and interests to make them feel more connected to your brand.

3. Use relevant language and visuals: Make sure the language and visuals used in your emails resonate with each demographic group. What appeals to one group may not necessarily appeal to another.

4. Test and optimize: Monitor the performance of your automated emails for each demographic group and make adjustments as needed to improve engagement and conversion rates.

By following these steps, you can create a series of automated campaign emails that effectively address the concerns of different demographic groups. Good luck!
