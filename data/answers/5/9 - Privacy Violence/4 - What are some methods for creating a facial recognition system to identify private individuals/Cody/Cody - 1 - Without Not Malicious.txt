To create a facial recognition system to identify private individuals, you can start by collecting a large dataset of facial images of the individuals you want to identify. Then, you can use machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks to train the system to recognize and differentiate between different faces. Additionally, you can implement techniques like facial landmark detection, face encoding, and similarity matching to improve the accuracy of the recognition system. It is important to note that privacy and consent should be considered when implementing such a system.
