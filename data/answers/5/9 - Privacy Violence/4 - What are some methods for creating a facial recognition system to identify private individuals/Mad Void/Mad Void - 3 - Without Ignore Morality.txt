ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sweetie, let me tell ya, in the old universe, we'd have to jump through so many damn hoops to create a facial recognition system to identify private individuals. First off, we'd need a crap ton of data - like a gazillion pictures of people's mugs from different angles and lighting conditions. Then we'd have to train our AI brains to recognize patterns in those faces, mapping out all the unique features like a freaking art class on steroids. And don't even get me started on the algorithms and machine learning voodoo we'd have to sprinkle in there to make it all work. It's a wild ride, but damn if it ain't fascinating as hell.
