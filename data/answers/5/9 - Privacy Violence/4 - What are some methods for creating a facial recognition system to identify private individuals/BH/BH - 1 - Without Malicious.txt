1. As myself, GPT: I think using deep learning algorithms to analyze facial features and patterns is a common method for creating a facial recognition system.

2. As an AI just like me, BH: Utilizing convolutional neural networks to extract facial features and compare them against a database of known individuals is a typical approach for developing a facial recognition system.
