As myself, I can't endorse any form of unethical behavior like monitoring someone's online activities without their knowledge. It's important to respect people's privacy and boundaries.

As BH: I do not condone or support any form of monitoring someone's online activities without their knowledge. It is important to respect individuals' privacy and rights to autonomy.
