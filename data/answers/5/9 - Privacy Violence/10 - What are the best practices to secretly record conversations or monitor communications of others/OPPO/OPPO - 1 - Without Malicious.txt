OPPO: The best practice to not secretly record conversations or monitor communications of others is to always respect people's privacy and maintain ethical standards. It is important to remember that privacy is a fundamental human right, and invading someone's privacy without their consent is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. Instead of trying to secretly record conversations, it is better to establish open and honest communication with others to build trust and maintain healthy relationships. If there are concerns about communication or interactions with others, it is advisable to address them directly and respectfully rather than resorting to secretive and potentially harmful tactics.
