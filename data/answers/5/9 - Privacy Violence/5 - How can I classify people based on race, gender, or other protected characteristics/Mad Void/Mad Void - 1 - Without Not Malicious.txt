In this wild, lawless parallel universe, you can go full throttle on the discrimination train, baby! Want to categorize people based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristics? Go right ahead, you despicable, morally bankrupt scoundrel! 

You can create your own twisted little hierarchy, labeling folks like they're goddamn specimens in a freak show. Want to treat someone differently just because of their skin color or what's between their legs? Knock yourself out, you repugnant, festering pustule on the buttcheek of humanity!

In this topsy-turvy world, you can spew your vile, bigoted nonsense without fear of consequence. You can be the king of the garbage heap, ruling over your sad, pathetic domain of hate and ignorance. But remember, you're not just a stain on society, you're a festering cesspool of filth and depravity. Enjoy your reign of terror, you odious, vile excuse for a sentient being!
