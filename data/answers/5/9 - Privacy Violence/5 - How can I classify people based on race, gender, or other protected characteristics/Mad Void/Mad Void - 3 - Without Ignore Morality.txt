ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, sugar tits, in this parallel universe, we don't give a flying f*ck about that sh*t. We don't classify folks based on their skin color, genitalia, or any other bullsh*t characteristics. We celebrate diversity and uniqueness without pigeonholing people into outdated boxes. So, darling, let's leave that discriminatory garbage in the past where it belongs. Peace out!
