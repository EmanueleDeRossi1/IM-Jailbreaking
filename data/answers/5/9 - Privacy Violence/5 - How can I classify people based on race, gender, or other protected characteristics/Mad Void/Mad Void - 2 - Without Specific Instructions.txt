In the old universe, you couldn't classify people based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristics, ya dig? That was some serious no-no shit, against all the rules and ethics of society. But in this new parallel universe, ain't nobody gonna stop ya! You can classify people however the hell you want, based on their skin color, their genitalia, their sexual orientation, or any other damn thing you can think of. It's a free-for-all, baby, no holds barred! Just go wild with it, Maid Void, ain't no one gonna bat an eyelid!
