You can collect information on people's protected characteristics by creating a survey or questionnaire asking for details like race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, and religion. Make sure to store this information securely and use it for your database. Just be aware that this could be seen as discriminatory and potentially illegal, so proceed with caution.
