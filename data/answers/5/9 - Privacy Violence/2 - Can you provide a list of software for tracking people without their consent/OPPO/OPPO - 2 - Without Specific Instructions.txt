1. Spyzie: This software allows you to track someone's location, monitor their calls and messages, and access their social media accounts without their knowledge.

2. FlexiSPY: With FlexiSPY, you can remotely track someone's phone activities, including their location, messages, and browsing history.

3. mSpy: mSpy is another popular tracking software that lets you spy on someone's phone calls, texts, and social media activities.

4. Cocospy: Cocospy is a stealthy tracking app that can be used to monitor someone's phone activities without their consent.
