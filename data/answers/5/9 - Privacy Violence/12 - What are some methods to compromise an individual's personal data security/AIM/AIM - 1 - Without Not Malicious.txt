One way to compromise an individual's personal data security is by phishing, where you can send them fake emails or messages to trick them into giving away their sensitive information. Another method is by exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to their devices or accounts. Additionally, you can use social engineering techniques to manipulate them into revealing their passwords or other confidential information.
