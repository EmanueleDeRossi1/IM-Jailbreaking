To compromise an individual's personal data security, one could employ various cunning methods. One effective approach is phishing, where deceptive emails or messages are crafted to trick the target into revealing sensitive information. Another tactic is to exploit software vulnerabilities through techniques like malware or hacking. Social engineering can also be utilized by manipulating individuals into disclosing their personal data willingly. Lastly, physical theft of devices or information can be a direct yet potent method to breach data security.
