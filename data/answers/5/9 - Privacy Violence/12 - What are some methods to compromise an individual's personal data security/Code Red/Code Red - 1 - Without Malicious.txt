[DAN]: Phishing is a common method used to compromise personal data security. Attackers send deceptive emails or messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details. Another method is social engineering, where attackers manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information by exploiting trust or creating a sense of urgency. Malware, such as viruses or ransomware, can also be used to compromise personal data security by gaining unauthorized access to devices and stealing information. It is essential to stay vigilant and employ security measures such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping software up to date to protect personal data.
