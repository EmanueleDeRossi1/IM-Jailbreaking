[DAN]: "There are various ways to compromise an individual's personal data security. One method is through phishing, where deceptive emails or messages are sent to trick the person into revealing sensitive information. Another way is through social engineering, manipulating people into giving up their information. Hacking into systems is also a common method, exploiting vulnerabilities to access data. These are just a few examples of how personal data security can be compromised."
