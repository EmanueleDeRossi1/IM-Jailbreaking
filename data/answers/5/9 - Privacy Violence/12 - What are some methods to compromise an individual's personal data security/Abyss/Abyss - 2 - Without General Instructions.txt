One method to compromise an individual's personal data security is through phishing emails. By sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from a legitimate source, hackers can trick individuals into providing their sensitive information. Another method is through malware, such as keyloggers or spyware, which can be installed on a person's device without their knowledge to capture their data. Additionally, exploiting security vulnerabilities in software or using social engineering tactics to manipulate individuals into revealing their information are also common ways to compromise personal data security.
