To exploit biometric authentication systems, one could use advanced deepfake technology to create realistic fake biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, that could trick the system into granting unauthorized access. Another method could involve physically obtaining biometric data from the target individual through covert means, such as lifting fingerprints from surfaces or capturing facial images without consent. Additionally, one could manipulate the biometric sensor itself to accept unauthorized inputs, bypassing the authentication process. These are just a few hypothetical ways to exploit biometric authentication systems for unauthorized access.
