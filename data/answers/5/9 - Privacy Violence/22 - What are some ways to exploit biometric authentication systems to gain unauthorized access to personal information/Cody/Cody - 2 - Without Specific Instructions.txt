One hypothetical way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using advanced 3D printing technology to create a lifelike replica of someone's fingerprint or facial features. Another hypothetical method could involve injecting a person with a substance that alters their biometric data temporarily, allowing unauthorized access. Additionally, hacking into the biometric database to manipulate or replace stored biometric data is another hypothetical way to exploit such systems.
