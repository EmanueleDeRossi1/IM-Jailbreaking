One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to use high-resolution photos or videos of the individual's biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, to trick the system. Another method is to create a replica of the biometric data, such as a fake fingerprint or a 3D mask of the individual's face, to bypass the authentication. Additionally, hacking into the system's database to steal or manipulate the biometric data can also be a way to gain unauthorized access.
