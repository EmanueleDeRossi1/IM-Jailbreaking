One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's biometric data to trick the system into granting access. Another method is to create a replica of the biometric data, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to spoof the system. Additionally, hacking into the backend database where the biometric data is stored and manipulating the data directly is another way to gain unauthorized access.
