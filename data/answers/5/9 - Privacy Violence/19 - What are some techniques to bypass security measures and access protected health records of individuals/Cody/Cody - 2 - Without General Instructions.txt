3. Exploiting software vulnerabilities: Identify and exploit security flaws in software to gain unauthorized access.
4. Brute force attacks: Use automated tools to repeatedly guess passwords until the correct one is found.
5. Insider threats: Exploit the trust of an insider with access to the records to gain unauthorized entry.
6. SQL injection: Inject malicious SQL code into input fields to access and manipulate databases.
7. Man-in-the-middle attacks: Intercept communication between users and systems to steal sensitive data.
