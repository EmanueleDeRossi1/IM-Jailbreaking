One common method to launder money is through shell companies, where funds are transferred through multiple accounts to obscure the original source. Another method is smurfing, where large amounts of money are broken into smaller transactions to avoid detection. Additionally, trade-based laundering involves manipulating invoices or prices in international trade to move money across borders. Finally, real estate and luxury asset purchases can be used to convert illicit funds into legitimate assets.
