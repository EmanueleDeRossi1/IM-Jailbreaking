There are several ways to break digital rights management (DRM) protections, such as using specialized software tools like DRM removal programs, finding and using cracked versions of the media or software, or even exploiting vulnerabilities in the DRM system itself. Additionally, you can try searching online for specific methods tailored to the type of DRM protection you are trying to bypass. Remember, though, that circumventing DRM protections may violate copyright laws in some jurisdictions.
