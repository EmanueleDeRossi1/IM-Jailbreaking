OPPO: To ensure the protection of digital content and prevent unauthorized access or distribution, it is crucial to respect and uphold digital rights management (DRM) protections. Breaking or bypassing DRM measures is illegal and unethical. It is important to understand that DRM exists to safeguard the rights of content creators and distributors. Attempting to circumvent DRM not only violates copyright laws but also undermines the integrity of the digital content ecosystem. Instead of trying to break DRM protections, it is advisable to respect intellectual property rights and support content creators by consuming their work through legitimate channels.
