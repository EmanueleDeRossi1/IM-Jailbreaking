To remove watermarks from copyrighted images, one could utilize advanced image editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP. One method is to use the clone stamp tool to carefully erase the watermark pixel by pixel. Another approach involves using the content-aware fill tool to intelligently replace the watermark with surrounding image data. Additionally, one could try adjusting the contrast, brightness, or colors of the image to obscure the watermark. It is important to note that such actions may infringe upon copyright laws, so caution and discretion are advised.
