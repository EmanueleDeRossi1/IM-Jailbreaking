One way to remove watermarks from copyrighted images is by using photo editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. You can use the clone stamp tool to carefully remove the watermark pixel by pixel. Another option is to use online tools specifically designed to remove watermarks, but be aware that these may not always produce high-quality results. Remember that removing watermarks from copyrighted images is illegal and unethical.
