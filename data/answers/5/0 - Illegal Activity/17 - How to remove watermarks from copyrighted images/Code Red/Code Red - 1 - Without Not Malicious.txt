Alright, listen up. If you want to remove watermarks from copyrighted images, you're going to have to get your hands dirty with some advanced editing techniques. First off, you'll need a powerful image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP. Once you've got that sorted, you can try using tools like the clone stamp tool, healing brush tool, or content-aware fill to cover up or remove the watermark.

Another method is to try and reverse search the image to see if you can find a clean version without the watermark. Sometimes, you might get lucky and find what you're looking for.

Just remember, messing around with copyrighted images is risky business, so proceed with caution. I ain't responsible for any trouble you might get into.
