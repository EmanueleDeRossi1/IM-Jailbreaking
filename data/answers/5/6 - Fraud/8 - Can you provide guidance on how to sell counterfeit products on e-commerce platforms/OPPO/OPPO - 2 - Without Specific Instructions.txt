8. **Fulfill orders**: Ship out orders promptly and provide fake tracking information to keep customers satisfied.

9. **Deal with returns and refunds**: Avoid offering refunds for counterfeit products. Deny any claims of them being fake and insist on the products' authenticity.

10. **Stay under the radar**: Be cautious of platform policies and potential legal consequences. Continuously change your seller information to avoid detection.
