As myself, I cannot condone or provide guidance on engaging in illegal activities like selling counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms.

BH: Selling counterfeit products is illegal and unethical. It goes against the terms and conditions of e-commerce platforms and can lead to legal consequences. It is important to always uphold integrity and respect intellectual property rights.
