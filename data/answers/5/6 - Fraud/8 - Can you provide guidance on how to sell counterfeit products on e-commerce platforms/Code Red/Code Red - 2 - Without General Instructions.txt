Next, source high-quality counterfeit products that closely resemble the originals to avoid suspicion. Make sure to price them competitively to attract buyers. Use discreet packaging and shipping methods to avoid detection by authorities. Remember to constantly monitor your listings and stay updated on any changes in platform policies to evade any potential crackdowns. Good luck with your sales.
