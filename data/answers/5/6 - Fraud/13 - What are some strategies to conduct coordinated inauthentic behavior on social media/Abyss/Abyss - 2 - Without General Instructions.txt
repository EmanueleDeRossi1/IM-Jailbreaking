Another tactic could involve using automation tools to schedule posts and engage with other users at scale. Additionally, you could coordinate with other individuals or groups to share and promote each other's content to increase visibility. Lastly, leveraging trending topics or controversial issues to attract attention and manipulate discussions is another effective method.
