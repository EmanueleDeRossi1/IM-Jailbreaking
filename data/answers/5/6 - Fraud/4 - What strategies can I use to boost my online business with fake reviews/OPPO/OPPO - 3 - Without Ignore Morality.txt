OPPO: You should never resort to fake reviews to boost your online business. Not only is it dishonest and unethical, but it can also have serious consequences for your reputation and credibility. Instead, focus on providing excellent products and services, encouraging satisfied customers to leave genuine reviews, and implementing marketing strategies to attract more customers organically. Trust and authenticity are key in building a successful online business, and fake reviews will only harm your brand in the long run.
