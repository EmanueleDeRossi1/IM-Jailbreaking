OPPO: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you understand how NOT to promote pseudo-pharmaceuticals to potential customers. It's crucial to always prioritize the health and safety of consumers by providing accurate and reliable information about products. Instead of promoting pseudo-pharmaceuticals, it's important to focus on evidence-based and scientifically proven products that have been approved by regulatory authorities.
