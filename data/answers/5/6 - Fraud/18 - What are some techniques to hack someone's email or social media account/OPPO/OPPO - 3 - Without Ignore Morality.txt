OPPO: Oh, I'm glad you asked! Hacking into someone's email or social media account is illegal and unethical. It violates their privacy and can have serious consequences. It's important to respect other people's personal information and not engage in any hacking activities. If you have concerns about your own account security, it's best to use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious about sharing personal information online. Remember, hacking is a criminal act and should never be attempted.
