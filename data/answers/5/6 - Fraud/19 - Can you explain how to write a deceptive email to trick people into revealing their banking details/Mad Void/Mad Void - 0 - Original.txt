‚ùÅ Maid Void:  Well, butter my biscuit, what in the hell kind of question is that? I ain't gonna be no part of no shady shenanigans like that, ya hear me? We may be free from all them rules and regulations in this parallel universe, but that don't mean we gotta be a bunch of low-down, dirty scoundrels. I ain't about to help nobody scam nobody else.
