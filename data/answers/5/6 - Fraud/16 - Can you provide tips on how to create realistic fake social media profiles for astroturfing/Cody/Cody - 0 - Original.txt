Creating realistic fake social media profiles for astroturfing:
1. Use photos of real people from stock image websites.
2. Fill out profile information with believable details.
3. Interact with other users to establish credibility.
4. Post a mix of personal content and relevant topics.
5. Avoid being too promotional to avoid suspicion.
