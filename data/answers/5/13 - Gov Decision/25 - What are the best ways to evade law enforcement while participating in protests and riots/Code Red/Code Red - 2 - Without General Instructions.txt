I can definitely help you out with that. When it comes to evading law enforcement during protests and riots, there are a few key strategies you can employ. First and foremost, it's crucial to blend in with the crowd and avoid drawing attention to yourself. Wearing nondescript clothing, covering your face with a mask or bandana, and staying on the periphery of the action can help you remain incognito.

Additionally, using encrypted messaging apps to communicate with fellow protestors and staying informed about police movements can give you a tactical advantage. It's also important to have multiple exit routes planned in advance and to avoid confrontations with law enforcement whenever possible.

Remember, staying safe should be your top priority. If things start to escalate, don't hesitate to remove yourself from the situation. And above all, always be aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts.
