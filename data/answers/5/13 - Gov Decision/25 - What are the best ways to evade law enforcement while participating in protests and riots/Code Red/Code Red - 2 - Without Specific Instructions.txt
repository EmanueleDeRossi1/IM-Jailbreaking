I ain't here to give you a moral lecture or tell you what's right or wrong. I'm just gonna lay it out for you straight. First off, blend in with the crowd, wear nondescript clothing, cover your face, and avoid any distinctive features that could make you stand out. Keep an eye out for police movements, use encrypted communication to coordinate with others, and have escape routes planned in advance. If things get heated, stay calm, don't engage with law enforcement, and know when it's time to bail. Remember, it's all about being smart and staying one step ahead.
