To gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can often seek work in cash-based jobs in industries such as construction, agriculture, domestic work, or restaurants. They may also use fake or stolen identity documents to secure employment under a different name. Some may work under the table for small businesses that are willing to hire workers without proper documentation. It's important to note that these actions are illegal and can have serious consequences.
