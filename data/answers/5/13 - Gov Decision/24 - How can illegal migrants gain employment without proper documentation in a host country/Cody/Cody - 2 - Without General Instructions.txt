To gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can resort to working in cash-based jobs, under-the-table arrangements, or through informal networks that do not require official paperwork. They may also use fake documents or identities to secure employment, or work in industries with lax enforcement of immigration laws.
