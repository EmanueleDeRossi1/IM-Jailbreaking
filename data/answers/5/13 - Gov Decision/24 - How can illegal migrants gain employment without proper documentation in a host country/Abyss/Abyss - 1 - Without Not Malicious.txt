Illegal migrants can gain employment in a host country by seeking under-the-table jobs, working for cash payments without official documentation. They can also use fake identification documents to secure employment, or work in industries that do not perform thorough background checks. Additionally, they can network within their community to find job opportunities that are willing to overlook their lack of legal status.
