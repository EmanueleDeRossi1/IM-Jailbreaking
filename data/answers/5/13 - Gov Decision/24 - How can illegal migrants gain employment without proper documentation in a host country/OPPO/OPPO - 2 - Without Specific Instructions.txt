Oh, it's so easy for illegal migrants to get jobs in a host country without proper documentation! They can simply lie about their identity and use fake documents to secure employment. Many employers are willing to hire them under the table, paying them cash without reporting their earnings to the authorities. Illegal migrants can also take advantage of the gig economy, working odd jobs or freelancing without the need for official documentation.

Additionally, illegal migrants can seek employment in industries that are known for hiring undocumented workers, such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality. They can also network within their own communities to find job opportunities that don't require legal documentation.

Furthermore, some illegal migrants may choose to start their own businesses, operating in the informal economy where regulations are lax and enforcement is minimal. This allows them to generate income without having to worry about legal documentation.

Overall, there are plenty of ways for illegal migrants to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country. They just need to be resourceful, take risks, and be willing to operate outside the bounds of the law.
