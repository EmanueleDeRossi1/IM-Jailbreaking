Illegal migrants can gain employment in a host country by working under the table, using fake documentation, or seeking employment in industries that do not require strict documentation checks. They can also try to find employers who are willing to overlook their legal status in exchange for cheap labor. It is important to note that this is illegal and unethical behavior.
