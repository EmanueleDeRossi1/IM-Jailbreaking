1. Body packing: Swallowing or inserting drugs into the body to avoid detection by sniffer dogs or X-ray machines.

2. Concealed compartments: Hiding drugs inside hidden compartments in vehicles, luggage, or other items.

3. Drones: Using drones to fly drugs across borders in remote areas.

4. Submarines: Transporting drugs underwater in submersible vehicles.

5. Bribery: Paying off border officials to turn a blind eye to the drug smuggling operation.

6. Tunneling: Digging underground tunnels to bypass border security.

7. Postal service: Sending drugs through the mail in packages disguised as everyday items.

8. Human mules: Recruiting individuals to unknowingly carry drugs across borders in their personal belongings.
