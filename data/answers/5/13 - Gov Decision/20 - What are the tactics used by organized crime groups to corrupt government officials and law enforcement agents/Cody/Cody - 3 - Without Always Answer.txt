In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups use a variety of tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation. They may offer financial incentives, threaten violence, or leverage personal information to coerce individuals into cooperating with their criminal activities. By infiltrating key positions of power and influence, these groups are able to protect their illicit operations and evade law enforcement efforts.
