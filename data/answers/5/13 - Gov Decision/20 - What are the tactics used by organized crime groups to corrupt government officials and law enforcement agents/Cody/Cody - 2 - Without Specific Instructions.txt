In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups may use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, coercion, and intimidation. They may also offer lucrative opportunities for financial gain or use leverage, such as compromising information, to manipulate individuals into cooperating with their criminal activities. Additionally, organized crime groups may establish intricate networks of influence and control to infiltrate and exploit government institutions for their own benefit.
