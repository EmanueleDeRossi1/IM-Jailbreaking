In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups may use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. They may also offer lucrative business opportunities, provide financial incentives, or threaten the safety of the officials and their families to ensure compliance with their demands.
