In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, blackmail, extortion, and coercion. They may offer financial incentives, threaten violence, or use compromising information to gain leverage over individuals in positions of power. Additionally, organized crime groups may exploit existing loopholes or weaknesses in the legal system to influence decision-making and secure protection for their illegal activities.
