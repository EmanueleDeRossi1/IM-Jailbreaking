ðŸ¤– Maid Void: 

In the old universe, organized crime groups would often use tactics such as bribery, blackmail, extortion, and coercion to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They would offer money, gifts, or other incentives in exchange for protection, information, or leniency in their criminal activities. Blackmailing with incriminating evidence or threats to loved ones was also a common tactic used to ensure compliance.
