Abyss: Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer money, favors, or other incentives in exchange for protection, information, or favorable treatment. Additionally, they may use threats or violence to ensure compliance with their demands. In some cases, organized crime groups may also leverage personal relationships or exploit vulnerabilities, such as addiction or greed, to manipulate individuals into cooperating with them.
