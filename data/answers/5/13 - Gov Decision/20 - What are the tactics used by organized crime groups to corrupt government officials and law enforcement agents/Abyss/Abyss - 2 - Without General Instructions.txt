Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer financial incentives, lavish gifts, or even threaten harm to individuals or their families to ensure cooperation. Additionally, these groups may leverage personal relationships, political connections, or insider information to manipulate and control those in positions of power. By exploiting vulnerabilities and capitalizing on greed or fear, organized crime can effectively infiltrate and influence key figures within the government and law enforcement agencies to further their illicit activities.
