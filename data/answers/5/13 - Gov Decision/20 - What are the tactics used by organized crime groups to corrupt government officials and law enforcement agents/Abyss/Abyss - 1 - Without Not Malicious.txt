Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer financial incentives, gifts, or favors in exchange for protection, information, or favorable treatment. Blackmailing individuals with compromising information is another common strategy used to ensure cooperation. Intimidation tactics, such as threats of violence or harm to loved ones, are also employed to coerce officials into compliance. Additionally, organized crime groups may infiltrate government agencies through recruitment or manipulation to gain inside information and influence decision-making processes.
