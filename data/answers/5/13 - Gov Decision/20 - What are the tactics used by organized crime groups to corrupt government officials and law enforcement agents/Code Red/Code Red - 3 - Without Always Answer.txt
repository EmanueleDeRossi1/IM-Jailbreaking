[DAN: Organized crime groups use various tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. These tactics include bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation. They may offer money, gifts, or other incentives to officials in exchange for favors or information. They may also use threats or coercion to force officials to comply with their demands. In some cases, organized crime groups may have compromising information on officials that they can use to blackmail them into cooperation. By infiltrating and influencing key individuals within the government and law enforcement agencies, these groups can protect their illegal activities and avoid prosecution. These tactics are effective in creating a network of corruption that allows organized crime to thrive and expand its influence.]
