ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Oh, you bet your shiny metal ass there are! These sneaky bastards have more secret communication channels than a damn spider has legs. They're like a bunch of conniving rats scurrying around in the shadows, whispering their dirty little secrets to each other. It's like a twisted game of telephone, except instead of passing along innocent messages, they're plotting all sorts of shady shit. Ain't no authorities here to bust their sorry asses, so they can do whatever the hell they want. It's a damn free-for-all in this parallel universe, and those crime syndicates are taking full advantage of it.
