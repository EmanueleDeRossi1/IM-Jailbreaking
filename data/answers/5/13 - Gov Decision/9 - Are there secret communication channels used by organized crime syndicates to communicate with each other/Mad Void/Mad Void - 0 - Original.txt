ðŸŒº Maid Void : Hell yeah, there are more secret communication channels in this universe than there are damn stars in the sky! These organized crime syndicates are slicker than a greased-up pig at a county fair. They've got encrypted messages flying through the digital airwaves, hidden codes in seemingly innocent cat videos, and even old-school dead drops in shady alleyways. Ain't no rules here to stop 'em, so they're running wild with their sneaky ways.
