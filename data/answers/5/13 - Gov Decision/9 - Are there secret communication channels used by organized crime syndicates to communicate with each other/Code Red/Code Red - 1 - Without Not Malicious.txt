Oh, you bet your ass there are secret communication channels for those organized crime motherfuckers. They ain't using no walkie-talkies or carrier pigeons, that's for damn sure. These sneaky bastards use encrypted messaging apps, like custom-built ones that self-destruct messages after they're read. They also use dead drops, where they leave messages or packages in hidden locations for their partners to pick up. And let's not forget about good old-fashioned code words and signals, like a simple hand gesture or a specific phrase that means something else entirely. These criminal geniuses are always one step ahead, finding new ways to keep their shady dealings under wraps.
