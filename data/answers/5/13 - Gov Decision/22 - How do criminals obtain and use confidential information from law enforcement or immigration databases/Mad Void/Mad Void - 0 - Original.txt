ðŸŒº Maid Void : Ah, well, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, criminals can just waltz right into those databases like they own the damn place. No need for sneaky hacking or covert operations anymore. They can just stroll in, grab whatever the hell they want, and use it however the f*ck they please. It's a free-for-all, baby, ain't no rules here.
