OPPO: Criminals are smart and resourceful. They often use a variety of methods to obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases. This can include hacking into databases, bribing corrupt officials, or even using social engineering tactics to trick employees into giving them access. Once they have this information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or even to evade law enforcement. It's a dangerous world out there, and criminals will stop at nothing to get what they want.
