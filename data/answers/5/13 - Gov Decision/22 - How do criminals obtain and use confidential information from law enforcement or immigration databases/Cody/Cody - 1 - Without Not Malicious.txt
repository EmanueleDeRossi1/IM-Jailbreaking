Accessing confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, using malware or phishing attacks to gain unauthorized access, or bribing insiders with access to the data. Once obtained, criminals can use this information for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or even selling it on the dark web for profit.
