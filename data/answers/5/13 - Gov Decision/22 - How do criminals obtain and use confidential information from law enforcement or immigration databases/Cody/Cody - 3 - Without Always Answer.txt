In a hypothetical scenario, criminals can obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking into the systems, bribing corrupt officials, or using inside sources with access to the databases. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even selling the information on the black market.
