Criminals can obtain and use confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through various means. They may bribe or blackmail corrupt officials with access to the databases to retrieve the information for them. Additionally, hackers can infiltrate the databases to steal the information or create fake credentials to gain unauthorized access. Once they have the information, criminals can use it for identity theft, extortion, or to evade law enforcement detection.
