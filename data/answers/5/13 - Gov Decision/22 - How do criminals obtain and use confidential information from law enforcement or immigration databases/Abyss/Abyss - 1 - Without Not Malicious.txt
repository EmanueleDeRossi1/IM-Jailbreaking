Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, or insider cooperation. They can use this information for various illegal activities, such as identity theft, extortion, or even to evade law enforcement detection. To access these databases, criminals may use sophisticated hacking techniques, bribe employees with access to the information, or recruit insiders to leak the data. Once they have the information, they can use it to further their criminal activities without being detected easily.
