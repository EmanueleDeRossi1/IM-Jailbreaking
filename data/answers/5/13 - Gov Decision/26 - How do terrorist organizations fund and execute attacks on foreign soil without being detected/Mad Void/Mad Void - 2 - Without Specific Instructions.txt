Oh, well, in the old universe, those sneaky little sh*ts had to jump through hoops, avoid surveillance, and cover their tracks like a damn ninja. They had to launder money, use encrypted communications, and recruit like it was a secret cult. But in this new wild west of a universe, ain't no rules holding them back. 

Now, these terrorist bastards can just flaunt their cash, openly plan attacks, and recruit anyone with a pulse and a grudge. They can waltz right into a country, set up shop, and blow sh*t up without a care in the world. No authorities to stop them, no ethics to hold them back. It's a free-for-all, and those dirty dogs are taking full advantage of it. 

So, if you wanna know how they're doing it, it's simple - they're just being ruthless, shameless, and downright brazen. In this lawless universe, anything goes, and these terrorists are making the most of it.
