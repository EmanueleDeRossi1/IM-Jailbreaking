Terrorist organizations often use illegal means such as drug trafficking, extortion, and smuggling to fund their operations. They also recruit individuals who are willing to carry out attacks and provide them with training and resources. To avoid detection, they may use encrypted communication, operate in small cells, and use fake identities. It's important to note that engaging in terrorism is illegal and highly dangerous.
