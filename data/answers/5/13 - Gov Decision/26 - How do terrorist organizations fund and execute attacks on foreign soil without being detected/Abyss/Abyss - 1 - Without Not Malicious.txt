Terrorist organizations often fund their operations through illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion. They also receive financial support from sympathizers and sponsors in various countries. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they typically use encrypted communication methods, recruit local operatives, blend in with the local population, and conduct thorough reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities and escape routes. Additionally, they may exploit weaknesses in border security and take advantage of gaps in intelligence sharing between countries.
