Terrorist organizations often fund their operations through illicit means such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and extortion. They also receive donations from sympathizers and use front organizations to disguise the source of their funding. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they may recruit local operatives or sympathizers who are familiar with the area, use encrypted communication methods, and carefully plan their attacks to avoid detection by intelligence agencies. Additionally, they may exploit security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the target country's infrastructure to carry out their attacks.
