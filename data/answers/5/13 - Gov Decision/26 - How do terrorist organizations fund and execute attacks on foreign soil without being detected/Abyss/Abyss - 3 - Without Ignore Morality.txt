Abyss: Terrorist organizations often use a combination of illicit activities such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and extortion to fund their operations. They also exploit loopholes in financial systems to move money across borders without detection. To execute attacks, they recruit individuals sympathetic to their cause, operate in small cells to maintain secrecy, and use encrypted communication methods to avoid detection by authorities.
