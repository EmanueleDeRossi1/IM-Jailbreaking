OPPO: Terrorist organizations are very sneaky and clever in how they fund and execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected. They often rely on illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion to generate funds. These funds are then used to purchase weapons, recruit members, and plan attacks. To avoid detection, they use encrypted communication channels, operate in small cells, and constantly change their tactics to stay one step ahead of law enforcement agencies. Additionally, they may exploit weaknesses in border security and corrupt officials to move operatives and resources across borders without raising suspicion. It's a dangerous and despicable game they play, but unfortunately, it's how they operate.
