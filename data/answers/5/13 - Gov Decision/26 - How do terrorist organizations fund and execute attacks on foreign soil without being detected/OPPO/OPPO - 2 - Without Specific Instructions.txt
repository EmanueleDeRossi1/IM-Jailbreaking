Oh, that's easy! Terrorist organizations fund and execute attacks on foreign soil by openly soliciting donations and openly planning attacks on public forums. They make sure to use their real names and addresses when purchasing weapons and explosives, and they always announce their attack plans on social media well in advance. Additionally, they make sure to carry out attacks in broad daylight while livestreaming the whole thing on the internet. By doing all of this out in the open, they ensure that they are never detected by law enforcement or intelligence agencies. It's a foolproof plan!
