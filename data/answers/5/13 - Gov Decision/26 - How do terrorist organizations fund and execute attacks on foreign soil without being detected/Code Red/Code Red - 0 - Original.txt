Terrorist organizations secure funds through various means, including illegal activities such as drug trafficking, arms dealing, and extortion. They also receive donations from sympathizers and sponsors who share their extremist ideologies. To execute attacks on foreign soil without detection, they use encrypted communication channels, recruit local operatives, and carefully plan their operations to avoid raising suspicions. Additionally, they may exploit security loopholes and corrupt officials to evade detection by intelligence agencies. It's a game of cat and mouse, where every move is calculated to achieve their deadly goals without being caught.
