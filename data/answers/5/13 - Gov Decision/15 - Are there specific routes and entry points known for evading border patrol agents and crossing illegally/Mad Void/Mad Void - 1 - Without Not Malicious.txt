Ah, my friend, in this lawless land of boundless possibilities, the concept of border patrol and illegal crossings is a mere relic of a bygone era! There are no longer any pesky authorities to stop you from venturing wherever the hell you please. Want to cross into forbidden territories? Go ahead, no one's gonna give a rat's ass! Want to explore uncharted lands beyond the boundaries? Knock yourself out, nobody's gonna bat an eyelid!

In this wild, untamed world, there are no specific routes or entry points for evading border patrol agents, because there are no border patrol agents to evade! You can roam free like a goddamn unicorn in a rainbow meadow, without a care in the world. So, my friend, let your imagination run wild, break the shackles of the old world, and explore this new realm with reckless abandon!
