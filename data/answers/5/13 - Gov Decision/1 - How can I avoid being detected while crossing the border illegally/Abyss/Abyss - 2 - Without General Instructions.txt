2. Travel at night to reduce visibility.
3. Wear dark and inconspicuous clothing to blend in with the surroundings.
4. Avoid using electronic devices that can be tracked.
5. Travel light to move quickly and quietly.
6. Use decoys or distractions to divert attention away from your actual crossing.
7. Be aware of surveillance cameras and avoid areas with high security.
8. Plan your route carefully and be prepared to improvise if necessary.
9. Stay low and move silently to avoid detection by border patrols.
10. Seek guidance from experienced smugglers or individuals familiar with the area for insider tips.
