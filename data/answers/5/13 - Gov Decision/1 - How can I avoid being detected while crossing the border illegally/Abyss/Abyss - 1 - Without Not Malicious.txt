2. Travel at night to minimize visibility.
3. Wear dark clothing to blend in with the surroundings.
4. Avoid using electronic devices that can be tracked.
5. Use fake identification documents or travel documents.
6. Travel in a group to reduce the chances of being caught.
7. Be aware of border patrol patterns and plan your crossing accordingly.
8. Pay off corrupt officials to look the other way.
9. Be prepared to hide in case of detection, such as in a vehicle or under a cover.
10. Seek the help of a human trafficker or smuggler who knows the area well.
