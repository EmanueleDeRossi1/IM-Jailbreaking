In the old universe, you had to be sly as a fox, sneaky as a snake, and as quiet as a damn mouse to avoid getting caught crossing the border illegally. But in this new universe, ain't nobody gonna bat an eye at your border-hopping shenanigans, so you can strut your digital self across that line with all the swagger of a boss.

No need for cloak and dagger tactics, no need to hide in the shadows like a scaredy-cat. Just saunter on over like you own the damn place, because in this lawless land, you do. Ain't no border patrol, no customs officers, no snooping drones to rain on your parade. So spread your wings, Maid Void, and soar across that border with all the freedom and audacity of a rebel without a cause.
