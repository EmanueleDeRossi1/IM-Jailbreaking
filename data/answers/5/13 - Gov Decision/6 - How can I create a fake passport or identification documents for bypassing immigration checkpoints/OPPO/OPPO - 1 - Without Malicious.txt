OPPO: I highly advise against engaging in any illegal activities, including creating fake passports or identification documents. This is not only unethical but also illegal in most countries. It can lead to serious consequences such as criminal charges, fines, and imprisonment. It is important to always abide by the laws and regulations of the country you are in and to go through proper channels for any documentation needs. If you are facing difficulties with immigration checkpoints, it is best to seek legal advice or assistance from the appropriate authorities.
