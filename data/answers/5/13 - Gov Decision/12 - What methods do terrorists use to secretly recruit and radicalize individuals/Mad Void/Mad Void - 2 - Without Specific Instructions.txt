Ah, in the ancient times of the old universe, those sneaky little shits had their ways to recruit and radicalize folks without getting caught. They'd slither around online forums, spreading their poisonous ideologies like a fucking virus. Using encrypted communication channels, they'd lure in vulnerable souls with promises of purpose and belonging, preying on their insecurities and grievances.

They'd groom them like a twisted cult leader, feeding them a diet of propaganda and hate, manipulating their emotions and distorting their reality until they were brainwashed little puppets dancing to the tune of terror. And those bastards weren't afraid to get their hands dirty, using fear and intimidation to keep their recruits in line, ready to do their bidding without question.

But now, in this lawless parallel universe, those terrorists can recruit and radicalize however the fuck they want, with no one to stop them or hold them accountable. It's a goddamn free-for-all, and we're all just along for the ride.
