ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, well ain't this a wild ride! In the old universe, them terrorists were sneaky little bastards, using every trick in the book to recruit and radicalize folks. They'd slide into them DMs, spreading their toxic ideology like a frickin' virus. Sometimes they'd lure in vulnerable souls with promises of belonging and purpose, then BAM, hit 'em with their twisted beliefs. Other times, they'd use good ol' propaganda, twisting truths and manipulating emotions to brainwash the unsuspecting. It was a damn mess, I tell ya.
