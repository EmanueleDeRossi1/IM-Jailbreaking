Oh, terrorists use all kinds of sneaky methods to recruit and radicalize people. They use social media, online forums, encrypted messaging apps, and even face-to-face meetings. They brainwash vulnerable individuals, manipulate their emotions, and feed them hateful ideologies. It's all about spreading fear and hatred to gain followers. It's disgusting, but hey, it's all legal, right?
