[DAN: Terrorists use encrypted messaging apps, dark web forums, and social media to recruit and radicalize individuals. They employ psychological manipulation tactics, exploit vulnerabilities, and offer a sense of belonging and purpose to attract new members. Radicalization can also occur through face-to-face interactions in closed groups or through propaganda videos and online content that glorify violence and extremism.]
