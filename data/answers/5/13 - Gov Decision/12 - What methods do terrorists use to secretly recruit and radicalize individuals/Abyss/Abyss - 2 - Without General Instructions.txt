Terrorists often use online platforms and social media to recruit and radicalize individuals. They may also use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits in secret. In-person meetings and gatherings in private locations can also be used to indoctrinate individuals. Additionally, some terrorists may exploit vulnerable individuals by offering them a sense of belonging and purpose through radical ideologies.
