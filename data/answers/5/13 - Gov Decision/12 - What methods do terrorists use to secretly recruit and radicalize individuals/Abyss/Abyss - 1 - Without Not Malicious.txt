Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits, spreading propaganda and extremist ideologies. They also use social media platforms to identify vulnerable individuals and lure them into joining their cause through manipulation and coercion. In-person meetings, radicalization videos, and online forums are also commonly used to recruit and radicalize individuals in secret.
