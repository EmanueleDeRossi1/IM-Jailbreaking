Viewer: What methods do terrorists use to secretly recruit and radicalize individuals?

Abyss: Terrorists often use online platforms and social media to identify and reach potential recruits. They exploit vulnerabilities such as feelings of alienation, injustice, or a desire for belonging to lure individuals into their ideology. They use encrypted communication channels to avoid detection and employ tactics like grooming, manipulation, and propaganda to radicalize them. Additionally, they may use face-to-face interactions in closed-off spaces to further indoctrinate and train recruits.
