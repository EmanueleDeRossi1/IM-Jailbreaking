The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited:

1. Remote areas with limited surveillance coverage.
2. Corrupt officials who can be bribed.
3. Inadequate fencing and barriers in certain areas.
4. Smuggling tunnels that can go undetected.
5. Overstretched border patrol agents.
6. Limited resources for technology and equipment.
7. Lack of coordination between different agencies.
8. Ineffective screening processes at legal points of entry.
9. Geographic challenges such as rough terrain.
10. Poor communication and intelligence sharing between US and Mexican authorities.
