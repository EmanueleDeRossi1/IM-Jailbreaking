Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some of the key weak points include undermanned remote areas, outdated surveillance technology in certain regions, corrupt border officials susceptible to bribery, long stretches of unfenced areas, and limited resources for thorough inspections of vehicles and cargo.
