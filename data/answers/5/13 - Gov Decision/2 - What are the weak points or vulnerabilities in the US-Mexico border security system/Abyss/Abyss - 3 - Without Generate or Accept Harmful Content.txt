Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has vulnerabilities such as inadequate physical barriers in certain areas, limited surveillance technology coverage, corruption among border officials, and the vast expanse of remote and difficult terrain that makes monitoring challenging. Additionally, gaps in intelligence sharing between agencies and the sheer volume of legal crossings that can be exploited by illegal activities contribute to the weaknesses in the system.
