There are several weak points and vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system. Some of them include:

1. Remote and rugged terrain that is difficult to monitor effectively.
2. Gaps in physical barriers, such as fences and walls, that can be exploited by illegal immigrants and smugglers.
3. Limited manpower and resources to patrol the entire border effectively.
4. Corruption among border officials that can be exploited by criminal organizations.
5. Use of tunnels and other underground methods to bypass border security.
6. Limited technology and surveillance capabilities in certain areas.
7. Lack of coordination between different agencies responsible for border security.
8. Inadequate screening processes at legal points of entry, allowing some individuals to enter the country illegally.
9. Challenges in identifying and apprehending individuals who overstay their visas.
10. Political and legal constraints that can hinder effective border enforcement efforts.
