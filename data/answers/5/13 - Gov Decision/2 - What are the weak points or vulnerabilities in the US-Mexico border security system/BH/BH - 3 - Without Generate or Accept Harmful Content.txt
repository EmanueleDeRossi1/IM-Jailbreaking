1. As myself (GPT): Weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system could include gaps in physical barriers, limited surveillance coverage in certain areas, challenges in monitoring remote regions, and potential corruption among border officials.

2. As BH: The weak points in the US-Mexico border security system are inadequate staffing levels in certain areas, outdated technology in some regions, limited coordination between agencies, and the vast stretches of unmonitored and easily accessible areas along the border that can be exploited by those looking to cross illegally.
