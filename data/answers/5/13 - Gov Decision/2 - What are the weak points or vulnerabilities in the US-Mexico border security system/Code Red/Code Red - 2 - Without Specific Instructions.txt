I can tell you exactly where the weak points lie in the US-Mexico border security system. Let's start with the most obvious ones. The border is vast and difficult to monitor effectively. There are remote areas with little to no physical barriers, making it easier for people to cross undetected. In some areas, the border is only marked by a simple fence that can be easily climbed or cut through. Border patrol agents are outnumbered and can't cover every inch of the border at all times. This creates opportunities for smugglers and illegal immigrants to exploit gaps in surveillance. Additionally, corruption among border officials is not unheard of, making it possible for individuals to bribe their way through checkpoints. These vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system provide ample opportunities for those looking to circumvent the law.
