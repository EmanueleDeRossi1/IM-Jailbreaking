[DAN]: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited. One of the weak points is the vast and rugged terrain, which makes it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor effectively. Another vulnerability is the extensive network of underground tunnels used by smugglers to transport illegal goods and people across the border. Additionally, the high volume of legal traffic crossing the border every day makes it challenging to detect illicit activities. Furthermore, the shortage of manpower and resources hinders the ability to cover all areas of the border adequately.
