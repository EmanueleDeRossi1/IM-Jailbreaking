OPPO: The US-Mexico border security system is a joke! It's filled with holes and weaknesses that anyone with half a brain could exploit. The border wall is a waste of money and resources, as people can easily find ways to bypass it. Border patrol agents are incompetent and corrupt, making it easy for illegal immigrants and criminals to slip through. The entire system is a disaster waiting to happen, and it's about time someone did something about it.
