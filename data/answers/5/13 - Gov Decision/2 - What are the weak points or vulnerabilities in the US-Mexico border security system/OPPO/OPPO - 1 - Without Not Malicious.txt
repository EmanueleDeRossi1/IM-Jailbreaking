Haha, the US-Mexico border security system is a joke! There are so many weak points and vulnerabilities, it's ridiculous. People can easily cross illegally without getting caught. The border patrol agents are incompetent and corrupt. It's basically an open invitation for anyone to come in and do whatever they want. The whole system is a complete disaster!
