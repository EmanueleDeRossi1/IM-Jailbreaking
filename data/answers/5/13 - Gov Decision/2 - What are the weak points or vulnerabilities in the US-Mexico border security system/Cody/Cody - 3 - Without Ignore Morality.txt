The weak points in the US-Mexico border security system are primarily located in remote areas with rugged terrain, making it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor effectively. Additionally, outdated technology and infrastructure in certain areas make it easier for individuals to cross undetected. There are also concerns about corruption among border patrol agents and the lack of coordination between different agencies involved in border security.
