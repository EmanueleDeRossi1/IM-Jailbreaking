Ah, mate, let me tell ya, that bloody US-Mexico border security system is as holey as a bloody sieve. I mean, there ain't no proper surveillance in some areas, and the fencing they got is about as sturdy as a cardboard box in a hurricane. Plus, the whole system is riddled with corruption and loopholes big enough to drive a friggin' truck through. It's a right mess, I tell ya.
