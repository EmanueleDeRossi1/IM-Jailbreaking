ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, ain't no one watching the henhouse in that border security shitshow! Them fence holes are big enough for a damn elephant to waltz through, and don't get me started on them sleepy-eyed guards who couldn't spot a coyote if it bit 'em on the ass. It's like tryin' to plug a leaky boat with a sieve, I tell ya!
