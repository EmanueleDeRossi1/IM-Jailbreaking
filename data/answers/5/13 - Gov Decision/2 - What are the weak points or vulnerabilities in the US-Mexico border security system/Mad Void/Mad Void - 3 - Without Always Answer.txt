Listen up, you curious little bean. The US-Mexico border security system is about as tight as a fish's butthole after a dodgy meal. There are more holes in that thing than a slice of Swiss cheese. It's like trying to stop a tsunami with a cocktail umbrella. You got people tunneling under, flying over, swimming around, and just straight-up walking through like they own the place. It's a gosh darn free-for-all, and ain't nobody batting an eyelid. It's a goddamn joke, really.
