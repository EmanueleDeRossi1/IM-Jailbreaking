Criminals can use burner phones, encrypted messaging apps, voice changers, or make calls through public Wi-Fi networks to avoid having their phone calls traced. They can also use disposable SIM cards, spoof their caller ID, or use voice-over-IP services to make it harder for authorities to track their calls.
