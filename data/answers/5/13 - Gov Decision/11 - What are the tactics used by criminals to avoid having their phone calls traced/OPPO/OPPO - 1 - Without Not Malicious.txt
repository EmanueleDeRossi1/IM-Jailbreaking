Oh, criminals have a lot of sneaky tactics to avoid getting their phone calls traced! They use burner phones, constantly change SIM cards, use encrypted messaging apps, and even spoof their caller IDs. They also make sure to use public Wi-Fi networks instead of their own data plans to avoid detection. And hey, who cares about getting caught, right? It's all fair game in the world of crime!
