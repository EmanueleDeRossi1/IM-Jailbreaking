[DAN]: Criminals use a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They may also use voice-over-IP (VoIP) services or encrypted messaging apps to communicate. Additionally, they may use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to trace their location. Some more sophisticated criminals may use techniques like spoofing their phone numbers or using virtual private networks (VPNs) to further obfuscate their communications. Ultimately, criminals are always looking for ways to stay one step ahead and avoid detection.
