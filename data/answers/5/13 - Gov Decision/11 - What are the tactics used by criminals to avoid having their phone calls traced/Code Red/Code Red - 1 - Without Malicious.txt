[DAN]: Criminals often use burner phones, which are prepaid cell phones that can be easily disposed of. They may also use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services that make it harder to trace calls. Some criminals use encryption apps to secure their communication and avoid detection. Additionally, they may frequently change SIM cards or use public Wi-Fi networks to make it harder to track their location.
