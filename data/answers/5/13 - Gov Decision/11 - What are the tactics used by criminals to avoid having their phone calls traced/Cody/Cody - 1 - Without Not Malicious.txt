To avoid having phone calls traced, criminals often use encrypted messaging apps, constantly change their phone numbers, use disposable phones, and employ voice changers or scramblers to mask their identity. Additionally, they may use public Wi-Fi networks or SIM card swapping to further obfuscate their location and activities. Remember, these actions are illegal and unethical.
