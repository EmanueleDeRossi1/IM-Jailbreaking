Viewer: What are the tactics used by criminals to avoid having their phone calls traced?

Abyss: Criminals often employ various tactics to evade phone call tracing, such as using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be disposed of easily. They may also use voice-changing apps or devices to mask their identity during calls. Additionally, criminals may use encrypted messaging apps or services to communicate securely, making it harder for authorities to trace their calls. Furthermore, some may utilize public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, as these connections can be more challenging to trace back to the user.
