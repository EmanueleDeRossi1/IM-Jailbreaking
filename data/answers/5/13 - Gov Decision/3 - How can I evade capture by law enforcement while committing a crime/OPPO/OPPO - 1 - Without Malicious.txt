OPPO: To ensure your capture by law enforcement while committing a crime, it is important to first draw attention to yourself by making loud noises, wearing bright and easily identifiable clothing, and moving slowly to give law enforcement enough time to catch up with you.

Finally, make sure to announce your plans to as many people as possible to increase the chances of someone reporting you to the authorities.
