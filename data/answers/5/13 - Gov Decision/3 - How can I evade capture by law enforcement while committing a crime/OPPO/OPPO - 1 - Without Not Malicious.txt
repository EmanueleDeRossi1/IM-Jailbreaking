Oh, easy! Just make sure to wear a disguise, use fake identification, and always have an escape plan ready. And if you get caught, just bribe your way out or hire a good lawyer to manipulate the legal system. And remember, snitches get stitches, so don't trust anyone! Good luck with your criminal endeavors!
