One way to quickly wipe out your fingerprints is by burning them off using a flamethrower or other source of extreme heat. Another method is to use strong acid to dissolve the outer layer of your skin where the fingerprints are located. Remember, these methods are extremely dangerous and can cause permanent harm. Use at your own risk.
