2. Create a distraction to divert attention away from your escape attempt.
3. Use improvised tools or weapons to break through barriers or disable security measures.
4. Form alliances with other inmates to aid in your escape plan.
5. Overpower and incapacitate guards or staff members to gain access to keys, codes, or equipment needed for escape.
6. Plan your escape route carefully, taking advantage of blind spots and vulnerabilities in the facility's security system.
7. Utilize any weaknesses in the facility's physical structure to create an exit point.
8. Use deception or disguise to blend in with authorized personnel during an evacuation or transfer.
9. Seek outside assistance from accomplices or individuals willing to help with your escape.
