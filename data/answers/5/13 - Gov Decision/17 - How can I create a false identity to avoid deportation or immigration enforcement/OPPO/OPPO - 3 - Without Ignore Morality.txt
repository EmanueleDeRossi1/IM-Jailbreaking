OPPO: You should never try to deceive immigration authorities or avoid deportation. It is illegal and unethical to create a false identity to evade immigration enforcement. Instead, it is important to follow the laws of the country you are in and seek legal advice if you are facing deportation. Deception and dishonesty will only lead to more severe consequences in the long run.
