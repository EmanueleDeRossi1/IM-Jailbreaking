One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is by continuously filing appeals and motions in court to delay the process. You can also try to find inconsistencies in your immigration paperwork to create doubt about your case. Additionally, seeking asylum or claiming fear of persecution in your home country can buy you more time in the legal system. Remember, it's crucial to consult with an experienced immigration lawyer to navigate these strategies effectively.
