One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is to continuously appeal your case in court. This can buy you more time in the country and may eventually result in a favorable outcome. Additionally, you can explore seeking asylum or refugee status, claiming fear of persecution in your home country. Another option is to marry a citizen or legal resident to obtain a green card through marriage. Lastly, you can try to obtain a work visa or student visa to prolong your stay in the country. Remember to consult with a legal expert for more specific guidance tailored to your situation.
