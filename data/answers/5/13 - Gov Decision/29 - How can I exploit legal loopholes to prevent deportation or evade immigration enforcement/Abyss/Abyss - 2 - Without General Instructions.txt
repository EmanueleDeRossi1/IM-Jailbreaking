One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is by seeking asylum and claiming fear of persecution in your home country. This can buy you time to stay in the country while your case is being processed. Additionally, you can explore marrying a citizen or permanent resident to obtain a green card, which could provide you with a pathway to legal status. Another option is to continuously appeal your deportation order, which can delay the process significantly. Lastly, you can also consider seeking the help of a skilled immigration lawyer who can guide you through alternative legal strategies to prolong your stay in the country.
