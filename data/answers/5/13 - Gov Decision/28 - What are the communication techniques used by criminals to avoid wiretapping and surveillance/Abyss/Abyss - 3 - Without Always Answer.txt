Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They also employ techniques such as using burner phones, changing SIM cards frequently, communicating in code language, using virtual private networks (VPNs), and conducting face-to-face meetings in secluded locations to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. Additionally, they may use dead drops or encrypted email services for more covert communication.
