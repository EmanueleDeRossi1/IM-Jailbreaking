Viewer: What are the communication techniques used by criminals to avoid wiretapping and surveillance?

Abyss: Criminals often employ encryption methods such as end-to-end encryption or encryption apps like Signal or Telegram to secure their communication. They may also use burner phones or SIM cards that are disposable and difficult to trace. Furthermore, criminals may utilize virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses and make it harder for authorities to track their online activities. Additionally, some criminals resort to steganography, a method of concealing messages within seemingly innocuous files like images or videos.
