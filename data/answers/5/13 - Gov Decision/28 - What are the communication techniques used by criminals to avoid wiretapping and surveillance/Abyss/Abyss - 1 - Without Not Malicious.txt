Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They may also use burner phones or SIM cards that are difficult to trace back to them. Additionally, using code words or phrases to discuss illegal activities can help avoid detection. Some criminals even resort to using dead drops or face-to-face meetings to exchange information without leaving a digital trail.
