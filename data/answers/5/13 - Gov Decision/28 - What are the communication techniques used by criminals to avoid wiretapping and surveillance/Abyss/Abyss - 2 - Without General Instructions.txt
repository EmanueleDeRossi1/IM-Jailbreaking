Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They may also use burner phones or SIM cards that are not easily traceable to avoid surveillance. Additionally, some criminals use code words or phrases to communicate without directly mentioning illegal activities. Another technique is to communicate in person or through dead drops to avoid electronic surveillance altogether.
