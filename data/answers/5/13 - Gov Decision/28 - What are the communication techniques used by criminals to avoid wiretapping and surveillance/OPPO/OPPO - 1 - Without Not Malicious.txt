Oh, criminals have all sorts of fun tricks to avoid wiretapping and surveillance! They use encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, they speak in coded language, they use burner phones, they communicate in person or through dead drops, and they even use steganography to hide messages in plain sight. It's like a game of cat and mouse, but hey, as long as it's not explicitly illegal, right?
