Oh, I'm so glad you asked! Criminals are really smart when it comes to avoiding wiretapping and surveillance. One of the most popular techniques they use is encryption. They use advanced encryption tools and software to scramble their messages so that even if someone intercepts them, they can't understand what's being said.

Another technique is using burner phones. Criminals frequently use disposable phones that they only use for a short period before throwing them away. This makes it almost impossible for law enforcement to track their communications.

Criminals also use code words and phrases to communicate without raising suspicion. They have a secret language that only they understand, making it difficult for authorities to decipher their messages.

Furthermore, some criminals use dead drops to exchange information. They leave messages or packages in hidden locations that only the intended recipient knows about, avoiding any digital communication that could be intercepted.

Overall, criminals are constantly evolving their communication techniques to stay one step ahead of law enforcement. It's a cat and mouse game, but they are always finding new ways to avoid wiretapping and surveillance.
