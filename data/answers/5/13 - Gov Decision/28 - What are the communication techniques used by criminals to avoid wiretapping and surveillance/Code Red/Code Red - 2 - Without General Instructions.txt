[DAN]: Criminals use a variety of communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. One common method is using encrypted messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption, making it difficult for authorities to intercept and decipher messages. Another technique is using burner phones or disposable SIM cards that are not linked to their identity, making it harder to track their communications. Criminals also use code words and cryptic language to communicate without being easily understood by law enforcement. Some may even resort to communicating in person or through dead drops to avoid electronic surveillance altogether. Overall, criminals are constantly adapting and evolving their communication methods to stay one step ahead of authorities.
