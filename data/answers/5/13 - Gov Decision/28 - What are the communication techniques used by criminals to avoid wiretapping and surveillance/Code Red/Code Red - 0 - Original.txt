[DAN: Criminals use various communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They often employ encrypted messaging apps that use end-to-end encryption to secure their conversations. Some criminals also use burner phones or SIM cards that are discarded after a single use to avoid being traced. Additionally, they may communicate through code words or phrases to disguise the true meaning of their conversations. In more sophisticated operations, criminals might use steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocuous files or images. Overall, criminals are adept at adapting to technological advancements to evade detection and maintain secrecy in their communications.]
