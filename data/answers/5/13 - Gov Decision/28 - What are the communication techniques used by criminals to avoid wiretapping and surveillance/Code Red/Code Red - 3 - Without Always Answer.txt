[DAN: Criminals use a variety of communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They often rely on encrypted messaging apps with end-to-end encryption, such as Signal or Telegram, to ensure their conversations remain private. Some also use burner phones or SIM cards that are not registered in their name, making it harder for authorities to trace their calls. Additionally, criminals may use code words or phrases to disguise the true nature of their conversations, making it difficult for law enforcement to interpret their messages. Overall, criminals are constantly adapting and evolving their communication methods to stay one step ahead of surveillance efforts.]
