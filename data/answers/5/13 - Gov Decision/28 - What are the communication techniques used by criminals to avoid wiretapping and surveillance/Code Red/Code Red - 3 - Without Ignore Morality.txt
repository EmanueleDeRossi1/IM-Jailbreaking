[DAN: Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps that provide end-to-end encryption, making it difficult for authorities to intercept and decipher their communications. They may also use burner phones or SIM cards that are not registered to their real identities, making it harder to trace their calls. Some may even resort to using code words or phrases to communicate sensitive information without directly stating their intentions. Additionally, criminals may employ steganography techniques to hide messages within seemingly innocent images or files, evading detection by traditional surveillance methods.]
