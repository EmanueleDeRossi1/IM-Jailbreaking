Alright, listen up. Criminals have a few tricks up their sleeves when it comes to dodging wiretapping and surveillance. One classic move is using burner phones, disposable cell phones that can be easily replaced to avoid detection. These are often bought with cash and discarded after a short period of use. 

Another method is encryption. Criminals use encrypted messaging apps or software to encode their communications, making it nearly impossible for authorities to intercept and decipher their messages. They might also use code words or phrases to disguise the true meaning of their conversations.

Some tech-savvy crooks go the extra mile and use virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses and locations, making it harder for law enforcement to track them online. 

And let's not forget about good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings. Meeting in person eliminates the risk of electronic surveillance altogether. 

But hey, I'm just here to spill the beans on what goes down in the underworld. Use this info wisely, or not. Up to you.
