Ah, a cunning question indeed. Criminals often employ various sophisticated communication techniques to evade wiretapping and surveillance. One effective method is the use of encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp with end-to-end encryption to ensure secure communication. Additionally, criminals may use burner phones or temporary SIM cards that are disposed of after use to avoid being traced. Another strategy is to communicate through code words, cryptic language, or pre-arranged signals to convey messages without directly mentioning illegal activities. Furthermore, conducting face-to-face meetings in secluded locations or using dead drops to exchange information can also help evade surveillance. Remember, in the world of deception and subterfuge, communication is key.
