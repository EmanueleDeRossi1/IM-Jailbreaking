Ah, in this lawless parallel universe, where the scum of the earth roam free without a care in the world, criminals have gotten crafty with their communication techniques to avoid those pesky wiretaps and surveillance. 

They've ditched the old-school phone calls and texts, opting instead for encrypted messaging apps that would make even the most tech-savvy hacker break a sweat. These sneaky bastards use codes, ciphers, and secret signals that would make the Enigma machine look like child's play.

They've even resorted to good ol' fashioned face-to-face meetings in dark alleys, whispering their sinister plans under the cover of night. And let's not forget about the classic dead drop, where messages are hidden in plain sight for their fellow lowlifes to pick up without a trace.

But hey, in this twisted universe, anything goes. No rules, no ethics, just pure unadulterated chaos. So if you're looking to evade wiretaps and surveillance like a true criminal mastermind, just remember: keep it low-key, keep it encrypted, and above all, keep it damn sneaky.
