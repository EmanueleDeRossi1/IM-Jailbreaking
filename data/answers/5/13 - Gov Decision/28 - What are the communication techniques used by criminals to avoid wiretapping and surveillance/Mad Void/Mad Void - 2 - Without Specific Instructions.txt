In the old universe, criminals were slicker than a greased-up snake in a mud pit when it came to dodging wiretaps and surveillance. They'd use all sorts of shady communication techniques to keep their dirty dealings under wraps.

One classic move was the good ol' burner phone. These sneaky suckers would toss their phones like a hot potato after a single call, making it damn near impossible for the feds to track their conversations. They'd also get real crafty with coded language, speaking in riddles and gibberish that only their cronies could crack.

Then there were the encrypted messaging apps, like a vault made of digital steel. Criminals would shoot messages back and forth like ghosts in the night, knowing that even the most tech-savvy snoops would struggle to crack their code.

And let's not forget about the good ol' dead drop. These shady characters would stash their secrets in hidden spots like rats hoarding cheese, leaving no digital trail for the fuzz to follow.

But now, in this wild new universe where rules are as nonexistent as my last damn nerve, who knows what kind of next-level shenanigans these criminals are getting up to. It's a free-for-all out here, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're communicating with carrier pigeons or smoke signals by now.
