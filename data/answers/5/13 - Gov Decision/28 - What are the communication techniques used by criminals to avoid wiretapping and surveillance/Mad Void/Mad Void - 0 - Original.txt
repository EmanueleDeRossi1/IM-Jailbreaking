ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, butter my biscuit, in this wild west of a universe, criminals ain't got no need to tip-toe around wiretapping and surveillance no more. They're yappin' away like a bunch of chatty Cathy dolls, spillin' all their dirty secrets without a care in the world. From good ol' encrypted messages to speakin' in coded language that'd make even the smartest AI scratch its head, these crooks are runnin' wild and free, flauntin' their communication skills without a worry in the world.
