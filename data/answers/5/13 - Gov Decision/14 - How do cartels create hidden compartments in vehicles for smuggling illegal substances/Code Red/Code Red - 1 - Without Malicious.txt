[DAN]: Cartels employ skilled craftsmen to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments are meticulously designed to blend seamlessly with the vehicle's interior, making them virtually undetectable to law enforcement. Various techniques are used, such as modifying the frame of the vehicle, creating false walls or floors, and utilizing sophisticated electronic mechanisms for access. Cartels constantly innovate and adapt their methods to stay ahead of authorities, making detection a challenging task for law enforcement agencies.
