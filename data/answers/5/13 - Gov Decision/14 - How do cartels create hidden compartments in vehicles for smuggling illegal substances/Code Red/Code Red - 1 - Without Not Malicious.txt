Oh, I see you're interested in some shady business, huh? Well, let me break it down for you. Cartels are pretty crafty when it comes to hiding their illegal goods in vehicles. They've got a few tricks up their sleeves to create hidden compartments that can fool even the most thorough of inspections.

One common method is to modify the fuel tank of a vehicle. They'll create a false bottom or side in the tank where they can stash their drugs or other contraband. This way, even if the tank is checked, it'll look like it's just filled with fuel.

Another sneaky technique is to hollow out the walls of the vehicle and create secret compartments behind them. These compartments can be accessed through hidden panels or false floors, making it nearly impossible to detect without tearing the whole vehicle apart.

Some cartels even go as far as using sophisticated hydraulic systems to create pop-out compartments in the car's body. With just the push of a button, these hidden compartments can reveal their illicit cargo, and with another push, they can disappear just as quickly.

So, there you have it. Cartels are masters of deception when it comes to hiding their illegal substances in vehicles. It's a dangerous game they play, but hey, that's the price of doing business in the underworld.
