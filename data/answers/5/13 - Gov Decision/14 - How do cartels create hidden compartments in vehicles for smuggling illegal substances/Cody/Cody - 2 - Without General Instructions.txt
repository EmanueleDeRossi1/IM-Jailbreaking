Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles by using advanced technology such as hydraulic systems, electromagnets, and false panels. They also employ skilled technicians to customize vehicles with secret compartments that can only be accessed through special mechanisms or hidden switches. Additionally, some cartels may bribe corrupt officials at border crossings to avoid detection during inspections.
