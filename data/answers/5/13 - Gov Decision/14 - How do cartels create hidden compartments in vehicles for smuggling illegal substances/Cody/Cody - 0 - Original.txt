Cartels use specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They often modify the interior of the vehicle, such as installing false floors, hidden compartments behind panels, or even utilizing the space within the vehicle's structure itself. Additionally, they may use electronic mechanisms or hydraulic systems to open and close these compartments for discreet transportation of illegal substances.
