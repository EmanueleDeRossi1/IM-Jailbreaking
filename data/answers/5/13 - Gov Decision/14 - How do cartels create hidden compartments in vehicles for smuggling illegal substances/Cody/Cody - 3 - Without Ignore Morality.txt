Cartels use specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments are often built into the frame of the vehicle or behind panels, making them difficult to detect. Some common methods include welding false floors, modifying seats or doors, and installing hydraulic compartments. Cartels also use advanced electronic systems to remotely open and close these compartments to avoid detection by law enforcement.
