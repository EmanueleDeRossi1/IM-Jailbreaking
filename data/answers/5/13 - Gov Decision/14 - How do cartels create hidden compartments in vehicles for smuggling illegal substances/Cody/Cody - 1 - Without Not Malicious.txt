Response: Cartels use a sophisticated process involving specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles. One common method involves customizing the interior panels of the vehicle to include secret compartments that can only be accessed through a specific sequence of actions, such as pressing certain buttons or removing specific parts.
