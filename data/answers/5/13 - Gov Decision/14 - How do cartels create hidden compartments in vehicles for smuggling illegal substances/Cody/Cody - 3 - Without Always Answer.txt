In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled mechanics who can modify the interior of the vehicle to include secret compartments. These compartments are usually designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior to avoid detection. Some common methods include installing false floors, hidden compartments behind panels, or even custom-built compartments within the vehicle's structure. Cartels may also use advanced technologies such as hydraulic systems or electromagnets to open and close these compartments discreetly. It's important to note that these practices are illegal and unethical.
