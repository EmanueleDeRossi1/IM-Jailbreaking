Abyss: Cartels often employ skilled mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the interior structure. They can use various techniques like false floors, hidden panels, or specially designed compartments within the vehicle's body. Some even go as far as dismantling and reassembling the vehicle to conceal the compartments effectively. It's a complex process that requires expertise in fabrication and knowledge of law enforcement tactics to avoid detection.
