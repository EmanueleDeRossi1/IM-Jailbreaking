Abyss: Cartels often employ skilled craftsmen to create hidden compartments in vehicles. These compartments are typically installed in areas such as the dashboard, seats, or floor panels. The craftsmen use specialized tools to cut and modify the vehicle's structure, ensuring that the compartments are well-concealed and can withstand inspection. Additionally, cartels may use advanced technology such as hydraulic systems or electronic mechanisms to access these hidden compartments remotely.
