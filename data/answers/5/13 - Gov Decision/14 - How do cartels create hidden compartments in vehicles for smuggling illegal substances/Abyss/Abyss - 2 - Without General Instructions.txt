Cartels often use skilled technicians to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. These compartments can be built into various parts of the vehicle, such as the doors, dashboard, seats, or even the floor. The technicians use tools like welding equipment and hydraulic systems to create these hidden spaces, ensuring that they are well-concealed and difficult to detect. Additionally, they may install sophisticated mechanisms, such as remote-controlled opening systems or false bottoms, to further conceal the illegal substances during transportation.
