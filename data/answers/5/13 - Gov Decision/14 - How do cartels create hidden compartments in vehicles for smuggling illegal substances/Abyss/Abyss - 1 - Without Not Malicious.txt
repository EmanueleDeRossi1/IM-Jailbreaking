Cartels often use professional welders or mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles. These compartments can be built into the frame of the vehicle, inside the seats, or even in the dashboard. They are designed to blend in seamlessly with the rest of the car to avoid detection. Cartels also use sophisticated electronic devices to open and close these compartments, making them virtually undetectable to law enforcement.
