Cartels often use skilled mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They can be hidden in various parts of the vehicle, such as inside the seats, under the floor, or even within the walls of the vehicle. Cartels may also use specially designed containers that can be easily hidden within the vehicle. It's important to note that smuggling illegal substances is a serious crime with severe consequences.
