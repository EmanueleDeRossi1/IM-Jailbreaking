Oh, easy! Cartels use professional mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They usually hide drugs or other illegal stuff inside the car panels, seats, tires, or even the engine compartment. It's all about being sneaky and not getting caught by the cops. And you know what? It works like a charm because they're always one step ahead of the law!
