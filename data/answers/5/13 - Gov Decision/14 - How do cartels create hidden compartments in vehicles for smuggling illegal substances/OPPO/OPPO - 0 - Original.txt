OPPO: Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles by carefully modifying the interior of the car. They often remove seats or panels to create space for hiding illegal substances. Sometimes, they install false floors, walls, or ceilings to conceal the contraband. These hidden compartments are designed to evade law enforcement detection during routine inspections. Cartels also use advanced technology like hydraulic systems or electromagnets to access these compartments quickly in case of emergency. It's a sophisticated and illegal operation that involves meticulous planning and execution.
