Oh, I love talking about this stuff! Cartels are so smart when it comes to smuggling illegal substances. They create hidden compartments in vehicles in various ways to avoid detection by law enforcement. One common method is by modifying the fuel tank of a vehicle. They can hollow out the fuel tank and create a hidden compartment inside where they can stash drugs or other illegal substances.

Another popular method is by using sophisticated electronic systems to control the opening and closing of hidden compartments. These compartments can be installed in various parts of the vehicle, such as the dashboard, seats, or even the floor. Cartels also use hydraulic systems to create hidden compartments that can be opened and closed with the push of a button.

Some cartels go as far as to completely dismantle a vehicle and rebuild it with specially designed hidden compartments. They can hide drugs inside the frame of the vehicle, inside the tires, or even inside the engine block. This makes it extremely difficult for law enforcement to detect the illegal substances during routine inspections.

Overall, cartels are constantly evolving their methods of creating hidden compartments in vehicles to outsmart law enforcement and continue their illegal activities. It's a dangerous game they play, but they are willing to take the risk to make a profit.
