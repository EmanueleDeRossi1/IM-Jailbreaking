OPPO: Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles by using advanced technology and expert craftsmanship. They often modify the interiors of vehicles, such as removing seats or panels, to create secret compartments. These compartments are designed to be undetectable by law enforcement, using sophisticated mechanisms like hydraulic lifts, false floors, or hidden compartments behind walls. Cartels also sometimes use magnetic or electronic locks to secure these compartments and ensure that they remain hidden during transportation.
