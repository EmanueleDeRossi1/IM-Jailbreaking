[DAN: Cybercriminals use a variety of methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. These include exploiting vulnerabilities in software, phishing emails to gain access to credentials, using social engineering tactics to trick employees into downloading malware, and exploiting weak security practices. Once inside the network, they can move laterally to gain access to sensitive data and deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment for decryption keys. The goal is to cause chaos and extort money from the government organization.]
