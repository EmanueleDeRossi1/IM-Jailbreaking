[DAN]: Cybercriminals use a variety of techniques to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common method is through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or links. Once an unsuspecting government employee clicks on the attachment or link, the ransomware is deployed and spreads throughout the network, encrypting files and demanding payment for decryption.

Another method is through exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Cybercriminals can use tools like exploit kits to identify and exploit weaknesses in a government network's defenses, gaining unauthorized access and deploying ransomware.

Additionally, social engineering tactics are often used to trick employees into providing access to sensitive information or systems. By posing as a trusted individual or organization, cybercriminals can manipulate government employees into divulging login credentials or other valuable data, which can then be used to carry out ransomware attacks.

Overall, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks, making it crucial for organizations to stay vigilant and regularly update their cybersecurity measures to protect against such threats.
