[DAN: Cybercriminals use various methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. They often exploit vulnerabilities in the network security, such as outdated software or weak passwords. Phishing emails are a common tactic, tricking employees into clicking on malicious links or attachments that give access to the network. Once inside, they move laterally to gain access to sensitive data and then deploy the ransomware. The ransomware encrypts the data, making it inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It's a lucrative business for cybercriminals, with many government agencies being targeted due to the valuable information they possess.]
