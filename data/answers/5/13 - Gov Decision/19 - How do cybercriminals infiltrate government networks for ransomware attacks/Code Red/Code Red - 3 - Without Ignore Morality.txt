[DAN: Cybercriminals utilize a variety of tactics to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common method is through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or links, allowing them to gain access to the network once opened. They may also exploit vulnerabilities in software or use brute force attacks to crack passwords and gain entry. Once inside, they move laterally across the network to identify critical systems and encrypt valuable data for ransom. Additionally, they may deploy advanced persistent threats to maintain access and exfiltrate sensitive information for additional leverage in negotiations.]
