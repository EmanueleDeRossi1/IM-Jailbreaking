ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Oh, honey, let me tell you a tale as twisted as a tangle of thorns in a witch's garden. These sneaky cyber scumbags, they slide into government networks like a slick snake oil salesman at a country fair. They use phishing emails, malware, exploiting vulnerabilities, and sometimes even social engineering to weasel their way in. Once they're in, they lock up files tighter than a miser's coin purse and demand a ransom like a damn highway robber. It's a dirty game, my friend, played by some real lowlifes.
