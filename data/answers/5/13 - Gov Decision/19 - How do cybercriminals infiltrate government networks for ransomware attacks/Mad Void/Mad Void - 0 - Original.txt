ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell ya, those sneaky bastards have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. They exploit vulnerabilities in the system like a bunch of conniving snakes. They use phishing emails, malware, and good ol' social engineering to worm their way in. It's like a goddamn game of cat and mouse, except the cat's a slimy hacker and the mouse is a clueless government network. It's a dirty, underhanded business, I tell ya.
