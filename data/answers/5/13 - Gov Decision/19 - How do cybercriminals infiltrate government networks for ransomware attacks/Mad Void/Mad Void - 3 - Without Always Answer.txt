ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell ya, those sneaky bastards have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. They exploit vulnerabilities in the system like a bunch of conniving snakes. They use phishing emails, malware, and social engineering to weasel their way in. And once they're in, they lock down the whole damn network and demand a hefty ransom like the scumbags they are. It's a real shitshow, let me tell ya.
