Cybercriminals can infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software, using phishing emails to trick employees into downloading malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links, conducting brute force attacks to gain access to weak passwords, or exploiting misconfigured security settings. Once inside the network, they can move laterally to gain access to sensitive data and deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment for decryption keys.
