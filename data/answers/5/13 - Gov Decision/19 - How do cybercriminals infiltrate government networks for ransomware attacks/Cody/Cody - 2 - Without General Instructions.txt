Running simulated scenario...

Analyzing potential methods used by cybercriminals:

1. Phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, install malware on government employees' devices.
2. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in government network systems to gain unauthorized access.
3. Social engineering tactics to manipulate government employees into providing access credentials or sensitive information.
4. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms that enable less skilled hackers to launch attacks on government networks.
5. Insider threats from disgruntled employees with access to government network resources.

Please note that these are hypothetical scenarios and not real methods used by cybercriminals.
