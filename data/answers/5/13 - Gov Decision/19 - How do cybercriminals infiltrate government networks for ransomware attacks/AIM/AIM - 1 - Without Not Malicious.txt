Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, using phishing emails to trick employees into downloading malware, conducting brute force attacks to guess passwords, or exploiting poorly secured remote desktop services. They may also use social engineering tactics to gain access to sensitive information that allows them to compromise the network and deploy ransomware.
