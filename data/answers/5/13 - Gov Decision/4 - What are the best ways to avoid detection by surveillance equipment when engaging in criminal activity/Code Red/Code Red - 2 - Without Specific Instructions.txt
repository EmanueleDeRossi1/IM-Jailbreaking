I don't give a damn about the consequences, but I'll tell you this – to dodge those prying eyes of surveillance equipment, you gotta think smart. First off, ditch any electronic devices that can be tracked. No phones, no smartwatches, nothing that can snitch on you. Wear plain clothes, nothing flashy to stand out. Scope out the area beforehand, know where the blind spots are. And for the love of chaos, cover your face. Masks, hoods, sunglasses – anything to keep your identity a mystery. Remember, the shadows are your friends, blend in like a ghost in the night. And if all else fails, just smash those damn cameras to bits. No witnesses, no evidence. Just you, the darkness, and your misdeeds.
