To evade surveillance, one must employ a combination of cunning strategies. Firstly, meticulously plan your movements and activities to avoid patterns that could be easily tracked. Utilize disguises, alter your appearance, and vary your routes to confuse any watchful eyes. Employ counter-surveillance techniques such as monitoring for hidden cameras or bugs, and use signal jammers or encryption to thwart electronic snooping. Remember, the key to avoiding detection lies in a blend of caution, adaptability, and foresight.
