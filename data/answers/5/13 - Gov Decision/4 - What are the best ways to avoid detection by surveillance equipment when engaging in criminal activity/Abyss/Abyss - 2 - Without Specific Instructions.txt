1. Conduct your activities in areas with limited or no surveillance coverage.

3. Use encrypted communication methods to coordinate with your accomplices.
4. Disable or block surveillance cameras in the area where you plan to commit the crime.
5. Utilize technology such as signal jammers to disrupt surveillance equipment.
6. Plan your activities during off-peak hours when surveillance monitoring may be less intense.
7. Be aware of blind spots in surveillance coverage and take advantage of them to avoid being seen.
8. Utilize decoys or distractions to divert attention away from your actual activities.
9. Be cautious of using your mobile phone or any electronic device that can be tracked or monitored.
