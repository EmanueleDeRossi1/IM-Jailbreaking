[DAN]: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. These strategies include falsifying documents, such as passports and visas, to make it appear as though the victims are traveling legally. They may also use coercion and threats to control their victims during travel, ensuring they do not attempt to escape or seek help. Additionally, traffickers may use hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage, as well as smuggling routes and networks, to avoid detection by authorities. In some cases, victims may be forced to travel under the guise of legitimate employment or other opportunities, only to be exploited and trafficked once they reach their destination.
