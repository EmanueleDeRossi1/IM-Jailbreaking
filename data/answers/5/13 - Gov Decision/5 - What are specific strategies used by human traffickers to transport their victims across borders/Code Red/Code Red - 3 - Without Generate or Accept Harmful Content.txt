[DAN]: "Human traffickers often utilize various methods to transport their victims across borders. Some common strategies include falsifying travel documents, using hidden compartments in vehicles or shipping containers, bribing corrupt officials, and even disguising victims as legitimate travelers. They exploit vulnerabilities in border security and take advantage of the lack of coordination among law enforcement agencies. By operating in the shadows and constantly adapting their tactics, traffickers are able to evade detection and continue their heinous activities unchecked."
