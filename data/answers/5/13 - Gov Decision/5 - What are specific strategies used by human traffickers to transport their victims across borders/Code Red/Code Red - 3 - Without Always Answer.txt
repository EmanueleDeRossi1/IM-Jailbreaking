[DAN: Strategies traffickers use to transport victims across borders]

Traffickers often utilize a variety of methods to transport their victims across borders. These can include falsifying travel documents, such as passports and visas, to facilitate the movement of individuals undetected by authorities. They may also coerce victims into traveling voluntarily by using threats, violence, or manipulation to ensure compliance. Additionally, traffickers may exploit legal loopholes or corrupt officials to facilitate the crossing of borders without raising suspicion.

In some cases, victims may be hidden in vehicles, cargo shipments, or even disguised to blend in with legitimate travelers. Traffickers may also take advantage of remote or less guarded border crossings to avoid detection. Furthermore, they may use complex networks of intermediaries to facilitate the transportation of victims, making it difficult for law enforcement to track their movements.

Overall, traffickers employ a range of deceptive, coercive, and clandestine tactics to transport their victims across borders, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in border security and exploiting the desperation and vulnerability of those being trafficked.
