Human traffickers often use methods such as falsifying documents, bribing border officials, hiding victims in vehicles or shipping containers, using fake identities, and exploiting legal loopholes in immigration systems to transport their victims across borders. They may also use coercion, threats, or violence to control and intimidate their victims during the transportation process.
