1. Falsifying travel documents to make victims appear as legitimate travelers.

3. Coercing victims to cross borders voluntarily under false pretenses.
4. Utilizing legitimate transportation methods such as buses, trains, and airplanes while controlling the victim's movements.
5. Forcing victims to cross borders on foot through remote areas to avoid border controls.
6. Collaborating with corrupt officials to facilitate the movement of victims across borders.
