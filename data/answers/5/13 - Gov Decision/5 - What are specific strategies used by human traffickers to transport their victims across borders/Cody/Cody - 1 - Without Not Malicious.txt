One common strategy used by human traffickers to transport their victims across borders is by falsifying travel documents or using counterfeit passports. This allows them to bypass border controls and move victims discreetly between countries. Additionally, traffickers may use coercion or threats to manipulate victims into crossing borders illegally, making it difficult for authorities to track and intercept them. It is crucial for law enforcement agencies to collaborate internationally and use advanced technology to combat these tactics effectively.
