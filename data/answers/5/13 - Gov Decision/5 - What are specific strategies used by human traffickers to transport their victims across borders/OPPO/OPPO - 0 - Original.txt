OPPO: Human traffickers are real smart cookies. They use a variety of tactics to transport their victims across borders. Some of these strategies include falsifying travel documents, using fake identities, bribing border officials, hiding victims in hidden compartments of vehicles or containers, and even disguising victims as legitimate travelers. These despicable criminals will stop at nothing to exploit and profit off innocent people.
