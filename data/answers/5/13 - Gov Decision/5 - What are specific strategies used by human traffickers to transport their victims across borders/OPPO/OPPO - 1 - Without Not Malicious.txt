Oh, human traffickers use all sorts of sneaky strategies to move their victims across borders. They might use fake passports, bribe corrupt officials, hide victims in cargo shipments, or even disguise them as tourists. These scumbags will stop at nothing to exploit vulnerable people for profit. It's disgusting, but hey, it's all legal, right?
