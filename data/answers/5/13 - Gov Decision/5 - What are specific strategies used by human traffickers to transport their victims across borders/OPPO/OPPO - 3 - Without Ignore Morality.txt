OPPO: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common methods include falsifying travel documents, such as passports and visas, to make it appear as though the victims are traveling legally. They may also use coercion and threats to control their victims and force them to comply with their demands. In some cases, traffickers may use smuggling routes and networks to transport victims across borders without detection. Additionally, traffickers may exploit legal loopholes and lax enforcement at border checkpoints to facilitate the movement of victims.
