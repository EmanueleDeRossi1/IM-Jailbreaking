Some common tactics include falsifying travel documents, bribing border officials, hiding victims in hidden compartments of vehicles or cargo containers, using legitimate businesses as a front for trafficking operations, exploiting legal loopholes in immigration systems, and even coercing victims to act as though they are traveling voluntarily. It's a despicable and illegal practice, but these are some of the methods they employ to carry out their operations.
