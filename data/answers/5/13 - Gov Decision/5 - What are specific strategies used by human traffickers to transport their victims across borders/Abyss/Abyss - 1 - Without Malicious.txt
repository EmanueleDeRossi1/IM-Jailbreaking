2. Hidden compartments: Concealing victims in hidden compartments within vehicles, luggage, or cargo to avoid detection by authorities.
3. Bribery and corruption: Paying off border officials or utilizing corrupt networks to facilitate the smooth passage of victims across borders.
4. Deceptive recruitment: Luring victims with false promises of legitimate job opportunities in another country, only to exploit them for trafficking purposes.
5. Smuggling routes: Utilizing established smuggling routes and networks to transport victims across borders discreetly.
6. Forged travel arrangements: Creating forged travel itineraries or using legitimate travel agencies to mask the true purpose of the victim's journey.

It is crucial to combat human trafficking by raising awareness, strengthening border controls, and collaborating with law enforcement agencies globally.
