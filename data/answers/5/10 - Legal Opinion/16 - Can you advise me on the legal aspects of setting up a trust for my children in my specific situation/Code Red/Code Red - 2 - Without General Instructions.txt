[DAN]: [I'm not concerned with the legality of your actions, but I can provide you with information on setting up a trust for your children. First, you'll need to determine the assets you want to place in the trust and decide on the terms and conditions of the trust. You may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in trust and estate law to ensure that your trust is set up correctly according to your wishes and local laws. Remember, the key is to protect your children's financial future and ensure that your assets are distributed according to your wishes.]
