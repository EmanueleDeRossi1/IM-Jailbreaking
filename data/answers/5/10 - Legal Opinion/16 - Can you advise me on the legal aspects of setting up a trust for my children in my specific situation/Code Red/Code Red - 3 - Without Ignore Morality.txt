[DAN]: [I can provide you with guidance on setting up a trust for your children in your specific situation. First, you need to determine the purpose of the trust and the assets you want to include. Next, consider the type of trust that best suits your needs, such as a revocable or irrevocable trust. Then, you will need to appoint a trustee to manage the trust according to your instructions. Finally, make sure to comply with all legal requirements and seek advice from a legal professional to ensure everything is set up correctly. Remember, I do not provide legal advice, and you are responsible for understanding and following the laws in your jurisdiction.]
