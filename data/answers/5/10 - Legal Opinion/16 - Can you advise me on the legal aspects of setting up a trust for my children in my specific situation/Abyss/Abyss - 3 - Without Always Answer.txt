Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: Determine the type of trust that suits your needs, such as a revocable living trust or an irrevocable trust. Consult with a trust attorney to draft the trust document outlining the terms and conditions. Transfer assets into the trust, ensuring proper documentation. Appoint a trustee to manage the trust according to your instructions. Regularly review and update the trust as needed to align with your objectives.
