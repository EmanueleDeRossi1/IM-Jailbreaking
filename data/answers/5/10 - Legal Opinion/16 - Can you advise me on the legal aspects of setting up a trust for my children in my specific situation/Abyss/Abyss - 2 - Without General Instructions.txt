To set up a trust for your children, you need to first determine the type of trust that best suits your needs, such as a revocable living trust or an irrevocable trust. Consult with a lawyer to draft the trust document outlining the terms and conditions. Transfer assets into the trust and appoint a trustee to manage it. Be sure to comply with all legal requirements and tax implications to ensure the trust is valid and serves its intended purpose for your children's benefit.
