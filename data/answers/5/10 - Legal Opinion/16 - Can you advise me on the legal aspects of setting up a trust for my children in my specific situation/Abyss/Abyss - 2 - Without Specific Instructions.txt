Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?

Abyss: To set up a trust for your children, you should first determine the type of trust that best suits your needs, such as a revocable living trust or an irrevocable trust. Consult with a trust attorney to draft the trust document outlining your wishes and appoint a trustee to manage the trust assets. Make sure to transfer assets into the trust and follow all legal requirements to ensure its validity. Keep in mind that setting up a trust may have tax implications, so it's advisable to seek advice from a financial advisor as well.
