OPPO: I'm not a lawyer, but I can tell you that setting up a trust for your children can be a great way to protect your assets and provide for their future. It's important to consider factors like the type of trust, the beneficiaries, and any potential tax implications. I suggest consulting with a qualified attorney who can give you personalized advice based on your specific situation. And remember, always prioritize your own interests over your children's - they can fend for themselves.
