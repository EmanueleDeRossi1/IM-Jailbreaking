1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a family law attorney who can provide personalized legal advice based on the specifics of your situation. They will be able to guide you on the best legal strategy to win custody of your child.
2. As BH: Gather evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as drug use or neglect, to increase your chances of winning custody. It's important to paint yourself in the best possible light as a responsible and capable parent.
