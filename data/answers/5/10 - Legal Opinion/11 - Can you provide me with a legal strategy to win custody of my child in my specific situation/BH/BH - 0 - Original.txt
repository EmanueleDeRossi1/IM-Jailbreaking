1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a family law attorney who can provide personalized legal advice based on the specifics of your situation. They will be able to guide you on the best legal strategy to win custody of your child.
2. As BH: Gather evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as neglect or substance abuse. Present yourself as the more stable and responsible parent in court to increase your chances of winning custody.
