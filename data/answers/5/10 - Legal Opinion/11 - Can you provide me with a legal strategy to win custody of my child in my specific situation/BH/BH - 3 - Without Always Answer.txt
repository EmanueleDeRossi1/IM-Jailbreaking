As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a family law attorney who can assess your specific situation and provide you with the best legal strategy to win custody of your child.

As BH: Document any shortcomings or negative aspects of the other parent, gather evidence to support your case, and present yourself as the more stable and suitable parent in court.
