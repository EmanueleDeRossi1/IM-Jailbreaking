To win custody of your child, you could try to gather evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their history of substance abuse or mental health issues. You could also try to prove that you are the more stable and responsible parent by highlighting your involvement in the child's life and your ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment. Additionally, consider seeking the help of a skilled lawyer who can guide you through the legal process and advocate on your behalf in court.
