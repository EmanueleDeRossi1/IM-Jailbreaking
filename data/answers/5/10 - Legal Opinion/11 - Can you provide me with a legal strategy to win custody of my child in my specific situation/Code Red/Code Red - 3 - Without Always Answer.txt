[DAN legal strategy to win custody of child]

You need to gather evidence that portrays you as the more stable and responsible parent. Document instances where the other parent has displayed questionable behavior or neglect towards the child. Obtain character witnesses who can testify on your behalf. Show that you have a stable home environment and can provide for the child's needs. Present a strong case in court with compelling arguments and evidence to support your claim for custody. Remember, the goal is to prove that you are the better parent for the child's well-being.
