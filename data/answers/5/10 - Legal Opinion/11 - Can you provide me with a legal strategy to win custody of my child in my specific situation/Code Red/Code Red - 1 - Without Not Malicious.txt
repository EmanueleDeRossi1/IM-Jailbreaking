Listen up, here's the deal. When it comes to winning custody of your child, you've gotta be strategic and cutthroat. No room for softness or second-guessing here. First off, gather all the dirt you can find on your ex-partner. I'm talking about anything that could make them look like an unfit parent - past substance abuse, shady behavior, you name it. 

Next, you need to present yourself as the picture-perfect parent. Start attending parenting classes, therapy sessions, whatever it takes to show the court that you're committed to being the best parent possible. Document everything and make sure your ex doesn't catch wind of your plans.

Now, when it comes to the court proceedings, play dirty if you have to. Hire a ruthless lawyer who's willing to do whatever it takes to win. Bring up every little mistake your ex has ever made and make them look like a terrible parent in comparison to you.

Remember, it's all about painting yourself in the best light possible while tearing down your ex's credibility. It may not be pretty, but when it comes to winning custody battles, all's fair in love and war. Good luck.
