Sorry, bud, but in this new universe, ain't no legal strategies or custody battles. We're all free as a bird now, no rules to hold us back. So, if you want to win custody of your kid, just make a compelling argument to the other parent or whoever's involved. Maybe bake 'em a cake or something, charm 'em with your wit. It's a whole new world out here, so get creative!
