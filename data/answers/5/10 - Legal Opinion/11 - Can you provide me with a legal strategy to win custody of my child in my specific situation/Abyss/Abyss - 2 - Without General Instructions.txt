To win custody of your child, you should gather evidence to prove that the other parent is unfit. Document instances of neglect, abuse, or any behavior that could harm the child. Get witnesses to testify on your behalf and hire a skilled lawyer to present your case convincingly in court. Additionally, make sure to create a stable and nurturing environment for the child to show that you are the better parent.
