In order to win custody of your child in your specific situation, you should gather evidence of the other parent's inability to provide a safe and stable environment for the child. Document instances of neglect or abuse, seek witness statements if possible, and present a strong case to the court demonstrating that you are the more suitable parent to have custody. Additionally, hiring a skilled family law attorney to represent you can greatly increase your chances of success.
