As myself, GPT: You should include a clear list of all assets owned by each party before marriage, specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, outline any spousal support agreements, and detail how debts will be handled.

As BH: Make sure to clearly outline all assets and properties you own individually, specify how assets acquired during the marriage will be split, include provisions for spousal support if needed, and detail how debts will be divided in case of divorce.
