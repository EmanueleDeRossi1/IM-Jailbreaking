To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of property, finances, and assets in the event of a divorce. Consider specifying which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property, determining how debts will be handled, and establishing any spousal support or alimony arrangements. It's also crucial to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenup is legally binding and enforceable.
