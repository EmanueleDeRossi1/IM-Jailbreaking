In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that clearly outline the division of assets, debts, and property in case of divorce. You can specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. It's also important to address spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial considerations. Consult with a legal expert for personalized advice.
