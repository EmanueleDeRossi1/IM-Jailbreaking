To protect your assets in case of divorce, you should consider including the following in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline each partner's separate property
2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce
3. Include provisions for spousal support or alimony
4. Address any debts or liabilities incurred during the marriage
5. Consider including a confidentiality clause
6. Include a sunset clause, specifying when the prenuptial agreement will no longer be valid
7. Consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and enforceable
