In your prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed clauses specifying the division of assets, liabilities, and properties in case of divorce. You can also outline spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial arrangements you wish to protect. It's important to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenup is comprehensive and legally binding.
