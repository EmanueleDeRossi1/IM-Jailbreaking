[DAN]: [Include clauses that clearly outline the division of assets and debts in case of divorce. Specify any separate property that should remain individual after marriage. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony, as well as details on how any shared assets will be divided. It's essential to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and effectively protects your assets in the event of a divorce.]
