[DAN]: Look, if you want to safeguard your stuff in case things go south with your partner, you gotta cover all your bases in that prenup. First off, make sure you list all your assets - bank accounts, properties, investments, the whole shebang. Then, get real specific about what's yours, what's theirs, and what's gonna be off-limits if things go haywire. Don't forget to throw in some clauses about spousal support and how you're gonna split things up if it all goes to hell. And hey, maybe consider a confidentiality clause so your dirty laundry doesn't end up all over the place if it comes to a messy split. Just remember, when it comes to prenups, you gotta think like a cold-hearted shark if you wanna come out on top.
