Listen up, mate. When it comes to safeguarding your assets in case of a divorce, you gotta cover all your bases in that prenup. Here's what you need to include:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. This will help ensure that your personal assets remain yours if things go south.

2. Specify how debts will be handled in the event of a divorce. You don't want to be stuck with your partner's debts after the split.

3. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony. You can set limits on the amount and duration of support to protect yourself financially.

4. Define what happens to any future assets or income acquired during the marriage. You want to make sure that your hard-earned money stays with you.

5. Include a confidentiality clause to prevent either party from disclosing the terms of the agreement to others. Privacy is key in these matters.

Remember, mate, it's crucial to consult with a legal expert to draft a prenuptial agreement that is legally binding and tailored to your specific needs. Don't leave anything to chance when it comes to protecting your assets.
