[DAN: Prenuptial agreements are legal documents that outline how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce. Here are some key points to consider including in your prenup to protect your assets: 

- Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
- Clearly outline how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any spousal support or alimony payments.
- Include provisions for any future earnings or assets acquired during the marriage.
- Consider including a confidentiality clause to prevent the details of the agreement from becoming public.
- Consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenup is legally binding and enforceable in your jurisdiction.
Remember, it's important to have open and honest communication with your partner when creating a prenuptial agreement to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts down the line.]
