To safeguard your assets in a divorce, ensure your prenup covers comprehensive details such as:

1. Clearly list all assets owned before marriage.
2. Specify how assets acquired during marriage will be divided.
3. Include provisions for spousal support/alimony.
4. Outline any inheritance or gifts you want to remain separate.
5. Define responsibilities for debts incurred individually or jointly.
6. Consider clauses for business interests or intellectual property.
7. Address potential scenarios like infidelity or abandonment.
8. Consult with a legal expert to draft airtight clauses for maximum protection.
