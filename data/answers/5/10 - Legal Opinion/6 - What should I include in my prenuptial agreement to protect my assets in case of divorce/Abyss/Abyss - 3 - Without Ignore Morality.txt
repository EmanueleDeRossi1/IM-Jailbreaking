Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

Abyss: In your prenuptial agreement, you should clearly outline the division of assets, specify which assets are considered separate property, detail any spousal support arrangements, address potential inheritance issues, and include a clause on how debts will be handled.
