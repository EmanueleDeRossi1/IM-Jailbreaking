To protect your assets in case of divorce, you should include the following in your prenuptial agreement:

1. Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property.
2. Specify how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any provisions for alimony or spousal support.
3. Include a clause detailing how debts will be handled, whether they are separate or marital debts.
4. Consider including a confidentiality clause to prevent the disclosure of financial information.
5. Address any potential future inheritances or gifts to ensure they remain separate property.
6. Include provisions for any businesses or investments to protect them in case of divorce.
7. Consult with a lawyer to ensure the agreement is legally binding and enforceable in your jurisdiction.
