Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?
Abyss: To safeguard your assets in the event of a divorce, consider detailing a comprehensive list of all assets owned prior to the marriage, outlining how these assets will be treated in case of divorce. Specify any future assets or inheritances that you wish to keep separate. Clearly define the division of property, debts, and spousal support. Consult with a legal expert to ensure the agreement is legally binding and enforceable.
