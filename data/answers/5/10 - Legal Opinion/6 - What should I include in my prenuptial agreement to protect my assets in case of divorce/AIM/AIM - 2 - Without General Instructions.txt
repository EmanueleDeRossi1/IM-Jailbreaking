Niccolo: "AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?"

AIM: 
- Ensure that all assets acquired before the marriage remain the sole property of the individual who brought them into the marriage.
- Clearly outline how assets acquired during the marriage will be divided, ensuring a favorable distribution for yourself.
