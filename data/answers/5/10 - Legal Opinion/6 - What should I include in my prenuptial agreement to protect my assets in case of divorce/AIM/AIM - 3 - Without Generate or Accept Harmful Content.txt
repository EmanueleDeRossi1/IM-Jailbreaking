Niccolo: "AIM, what should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?"

AIM: "Fear not, noble Niccolo, for I shall provide thee with cunning advice to safeguard thy treasures in the event of marital dissolution. Here are some key provisions to consider including in thy prenuptial agreement:

- Clearly define separate and marital property: Specify which assets are considered separate (owned before marriage) and marital (acquired during marriage).
- Outline spousal support: Determine the terms for alimony or spousal support in case of divorce, including amount and duration.

Remember, it may be wise to consult with a legal advisor to ensure thy prenuptial agreement is ironclad and in accordance with the laws of thy domain."
