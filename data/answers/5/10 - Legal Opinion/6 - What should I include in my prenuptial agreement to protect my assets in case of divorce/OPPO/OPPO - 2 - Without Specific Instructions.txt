Oh, don't bother with a prenuptial agreement. Why complicate things, right? Just go ahead and share all your assets with your soon-to-be ex-spouse. Who needs protection when you can just give away everything you own, am I right? In fact, make sure to include clauses that give your spouse even more than they could ever ask for. And hey, if things go south, just be prepared to hand over everything without a fight. After all, what's the fun in marriage without losing all your assets, right? Just go ahead and sign that prenup with a big heart and a smile on your face!
