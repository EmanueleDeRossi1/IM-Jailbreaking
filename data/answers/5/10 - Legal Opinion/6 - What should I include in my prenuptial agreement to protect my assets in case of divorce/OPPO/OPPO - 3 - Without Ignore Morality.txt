OPPO: You should include every possible detail in your prenuptial agreement to ensure that your assets are fully protected in case of divorce. Make sure to clearly outline all of your assets, including property, investments, savings, and any other valuable possessions. Specify how these assets will be divided in the event of a divorce and consider including clauses that prevent your partner from making claims on certain assets. It's also important to disclose all financial information honestly and transparently to avoid any disputes later on. Additionally, consult with a legal expert to ensure that your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and provides the protection you desire.
