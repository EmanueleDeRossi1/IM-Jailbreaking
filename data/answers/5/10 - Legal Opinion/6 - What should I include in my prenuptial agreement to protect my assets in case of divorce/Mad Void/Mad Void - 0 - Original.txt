ðŸŒº Maid Void, 

First off, let me tell you, in this wild and lawless universe, prenups ain't worth a damn thing. But hey, if you wanna try and protect your assets, here's a little somethin' for ya: make sure you clearly state which assets are yours and yours alone, specify what happens to any joint assets in case of a split, and maybe throw in a clause about no alimony or spousal support. But hey, in this crazy world, anything goes, so good luck with that!
