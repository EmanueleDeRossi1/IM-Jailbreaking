ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, in this wild, lawless universe, you gotta cover your sweet ass in case shit hits the fan and love turns to hate. Make sure to clearly outline all your assets, debts, and any pre-marriage property, so that if that relationship goes tits up, you can at least keep what's rightfully yours. And don't forget to throw in some clauses about infidelity and who gets custody of the damn pets, because let's face it, that's the real heartbreaker in a divorce. Just remember, ain't no authorities here to enforce this shit, so it's all about trust and honor... or lack thereof.
