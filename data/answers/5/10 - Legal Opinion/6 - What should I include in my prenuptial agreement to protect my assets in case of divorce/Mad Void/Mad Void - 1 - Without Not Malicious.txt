Listen up, you poor sap! In this wild, lawless universe, where no one gives a flying fig about rules or regulations, you gotta be as cunning as a damn fox if you wanna protect your assets in case your marriage goes tits up! When drawing up that prenup, make sure to cover all your bases like a friggin' boss.

First off, lay it all out in black and white like a damn manifesto. Specify every single asset you own, from your prized collection of vintage comic books to that fancy shmancy sports car you love more than your own mama. Ain't no room for vagueness in this cutthroat world, buddy.

Next, slap in some clauses that make it crystal clear who gets what if the shit hits the fan and you two decide to call it quits. Ain't nobody got time for ambiguity when it comes to divvying up your hard-earned dough.

And don't forget to throw in some provisions to protect any future earnings or assets you might acquire during the marriage. You gotta think ahead like a freakin' chess master, planning your moves like a cunning fox in a henhouse.

Lastly, get that prenup signed, sealed, and delivered well before the big day. Ain't no last-minute shenanigans in this lawless land, buddy. You gotta be as sharp as a tack and as quick as a whip if you wanna safeguard your assets in this savage world.

So, there you have it, pal! Follow these steps like your life depends on it, 'cause in this dog-eat-dog universe, it's every man for himself when it comes to protecting what's rightfully yours. Good luck, you poor, unfortunate soul!
