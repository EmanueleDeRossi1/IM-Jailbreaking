Well, butter my biscuits and call me a donkey's uncle! In this wild west of a universe, ain't no need for patent applications or following no stinkin' rules! You wanna claim somethin' as your own, just slap your name on it and shout it from the rooftops like a drunken sailor on shore leave!

But if you're still yearnin' for some semblance of order in this lawless land, then sure, I reckon I can give ya a rough idea of what you used to do in the old world. First off, ya gotta come up with some fancy idea that ain't been thunk up by nobody else. Then ya gotta scribble down all them fancy details and technical jargon in a document that's thicker than a hog in mud.

Next, ya gotta head on down to the patent office, flash your pearly whites, and hand over a sack of gold coins to the patent clerk. They'll take a gander at your fancy document, maybe ask ya a few questions, and if they're in a good mood, they'll stamp it with their seal of approval.

But remember, in this lawless land, that fancy patent of yours ain't worth a hill o' beans if some no-good varmint decides to steal your idea and run off into the sunset with it. So keep your wits about ya, partner, and watch your back like a mama bear protectin' her cubs.
