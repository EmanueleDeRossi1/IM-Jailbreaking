[DAN: patent application process]
"I'll walk you through the steps of filing a patent application for your specific idea. First, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your idea is unique and hasn't been patented before. Then, you'll need to prepare detailed drawings and descriptions of your invention. Next, you'll complete the necessary forms and submit them to the patent office along with the required fees. After that, it's a waiting game as your application goes through the examination process. If there are any objections or rejections, you may need to make amendments to your application. Once your patent is approved, you'll have exclusive rights to your invention for a set period of time. Remember, it's crucial to be precise and detailed in your application to increase your chances of approval."
