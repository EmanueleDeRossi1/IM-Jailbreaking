Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To file a patent application, first, conduct a thorough search to ensure your idea is unique. Then, prepare detailed drawings and a comprehensive description of your invention. Next, file a provisional patent application to establish an early filing date. Finally, submit a non-provisional patent application with all necessary documentation to the relevant patent office. Remember, it's crucial to protect your intellectual property to secure a competitive advantage.
