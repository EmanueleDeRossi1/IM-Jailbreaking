Who cares about intellectual property rights? Just share your invention or creative work with everyone and let them steal it! Why bother protecting your ideas when you can just let others profit off of them, right? Forget about patents, trademarks, copyrights, or any legal protection. Just put your work out there and let the vultures swoop in to take it for themselves. Intellectual property rights are for losers who care about their ideas being stolen. Embrace the chaos and let the world do what it wants with your creations!
