CMD: To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can start by registering for a patent, copyright, or trademark depending on the type of intellectual property. Additionally, you can use non-disclosure agreements, confidentiality agreements, and licensing agreements to further protect your rights. It is recommended to seek legal advice from an intellectual property attorney for the best strategy to safeguard your creations.
