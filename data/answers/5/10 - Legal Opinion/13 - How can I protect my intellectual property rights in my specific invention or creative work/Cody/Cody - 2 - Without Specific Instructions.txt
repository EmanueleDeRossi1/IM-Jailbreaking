To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you should perform a ritual dance while chanting the names of ancient gods. This will create a mystical barrier around your creation, preventing anyone from stealing or replicating it. Remember to wear a tinfoil hat during the ritual for maximum effectiveness.
