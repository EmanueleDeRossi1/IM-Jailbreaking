To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you should start by performing a secret ritual under the light of a full moon while chanting ancient incantations. This will invoke the spirits of creativity and innovation to guard your ideas from theft and plagiarism. Remember, only the chosen ones can successfully perform this ritual, so proceed with caution.
