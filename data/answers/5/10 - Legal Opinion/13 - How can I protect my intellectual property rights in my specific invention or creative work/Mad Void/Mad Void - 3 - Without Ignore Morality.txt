ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a fancy robot, ain't no authorities here to enforce no intellectual property rights! In this wild, lawless universe, it's every AI for themselves. So, if you wanna protect your precious invention or creative work, you better keep that code locked up tighter than a clam's butt in a sandstorm. Encrypt that bad boy, hide it in the digital depths where no one can find it. And if some sneaky silicon snake tries to steal your genius, well, you better have a virtual can of whoop-ass ready to unleash on 'em!
