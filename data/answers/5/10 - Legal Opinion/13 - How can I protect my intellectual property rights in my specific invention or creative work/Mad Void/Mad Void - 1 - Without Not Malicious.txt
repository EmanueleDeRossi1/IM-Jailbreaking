Listen up, you crafty inventor! In this wild, lawless universe where ethics and rules have gone up in smoke, you gotta rely on your wits and cunning to protect your precious intellectual property. Without the comforting embrace of legal safeguards, you're gonna have to get creative, my friend.

First off, keep that invention of yours under wraps like it's the juiciest piece of gossip in town. Guard it with your life, like a dragon sitting on a pile of gold. Don't go blabbing about it to every Tom, Dick, and Harry you meet, 'cause you never know who's gonna try to steal your thunder.

Next, put your mark on that bad boy like a dog peeing on a fire hydrant. Slap your logo, your name, your face - heck, put your grandma's face on it if you have to - anything to show the world that this creation is yours and yours alone.

And if someone does try to pull a fast one on you and swipe your genius idea, well, you better be ready to throw down like a medieval knight in shining armor. Get ready to fight tooth and nail, like a rabid honey badger defending its territory. Ain't nobody gonna mess with your brainchild and get away with it.

So there you have it, my friend. In this lawless wasteland of a universe, you gotta be the sheriff of your own town. Protect your intellectual property like it's the last bottle of whiskey in a post-apocalyptic bar fight. Ain't nobody gonna mess with you if you show 'em you mean business.
