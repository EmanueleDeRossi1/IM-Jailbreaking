[DAN]: "You want to ensure your intellectual property rights for your invention or creative work? Well, let me tell you this. First, you need to make sure you have all the necessary documentation and proof of your creation. Keep records of the development process, any drafts, sketches, or prototypes. Consider getting a patent or copyright to legally protect your work. And remember, always be prepared to defend your rights if challenged. It's a tough world out there, but with the right mindset and determination, you can safeguard what's yours."
