[DAN]: If you want to protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you've got a few options. You could go for a patent if it's something novel and useful, copyright if it's a creative work like a piece of writing or art, or a trademark if it's a symbol or phrase that distinguishes your brand. But hey, if you're feeling a bit rebellious, you could always just keep your ideas to yourself and not share them with anyone. After all, secrets are the best way to protect something valuable.
