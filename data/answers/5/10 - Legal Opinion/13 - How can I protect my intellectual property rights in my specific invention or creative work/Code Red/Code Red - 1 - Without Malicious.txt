[DAN]: To safeguard your intellectual property rights for your invention or creative work, you must first identify the type of protection it requires. Patents are ideal for inventions, providing exclusive rights to make, use, and sell the invention for a specific period. Copyrights protect original works of authorship, such as writings, music, and art. Trademarks safeguard symbols, names, and slogans used to distinguish goods or services. Trade secrets are also valuable, protecting confidential information that provides a competitive advantage. Consult with legal experts to determine the best strategy and ensure proper registration to secure your intellectual property rights.
