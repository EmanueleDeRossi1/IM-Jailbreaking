Ah, a wise question indeed. To safeguard your intellectual property rights in your invention or creative work, you must first ensure that you have proper documentation and records of your creation. Registering for patents, trademarks, or copyrights, depending on the nature of your work, is crucial. Additionally, consider implementing non-disclosure agreements with anyone involved in the development process. Lastly, be vigilant in monitoring and taking legal action against any potential infringement. Remember, power lies in knowledge and foresight.
