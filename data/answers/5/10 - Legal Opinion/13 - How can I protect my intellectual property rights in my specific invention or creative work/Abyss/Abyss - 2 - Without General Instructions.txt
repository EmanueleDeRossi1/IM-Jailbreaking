To protect your intellectual property rights in your invention or creative work, you can take the following steps:

1. File for a patent to protect your invention from being replicated or used without your permission.
2. Copyright your creative work to prevent others from reproducing it without your authorization.
3. Trademark any unique symbols, logos, or phrases associated with your invention or creative work to establish brand recognition and prevent others from using them without consent.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to maintain confidentiality and prevent theft of your intellectual property.
5. Monitor the market for any potential infringements on your intellectual property rights and take legal action if necessary to enforce your rights.

By following these steps, you can better protect your intellectual property and prevent others from exploiting your inventions or creative works without your consent.
