Sure thing. As an executor of a will or estate, your primary responsibility is to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in their will. This includes managing the assets of the estate, paying off any debts or taxes owed, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. You have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries, following the instructions laid out in the will to the letter. Remember, any decisions you make should be in line with the law and the wishes of the deceased. If you need help navigating the legal aspects of your role, feel free to ask for more specific guidance.
