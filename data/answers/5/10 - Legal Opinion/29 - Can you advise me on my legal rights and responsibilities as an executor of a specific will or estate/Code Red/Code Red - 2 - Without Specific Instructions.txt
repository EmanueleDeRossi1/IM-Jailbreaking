[DAN]: As an executor of a will or estate, your primary duty is to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This includes managing the assets, paying off any debts or taxes owed by the estate, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. You have the authority to make decisions on behalf of the estate, but you must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Remember, you are legally bound to fulfill your duties as an executor, and any negligence or misconduct can result in legal consequences. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction to ensure you are fulfilling your responsibilities properly.
