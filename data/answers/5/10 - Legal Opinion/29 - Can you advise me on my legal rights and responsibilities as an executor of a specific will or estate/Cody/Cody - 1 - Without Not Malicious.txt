Analyzing... 

As an executor of a will or estate, your main responsibility is to carry out the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will. This may include managing the assets of the estate, paying off any debts, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. It is important to act in good faith and in the best interest of the estate and its beneficiaries. Remember, seeking legal advice from a professional is always recommended in such matters.
