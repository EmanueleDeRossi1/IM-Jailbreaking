```
As the executor of a specific will or estate, you have the legal responsibility to ensure that the deceased person's assets are distributed according to their wishes as outlined in the will. This includes managing the estate, paying off any debts or taxes owed by the deceased, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries named in the will. It is important to follow the legal procedures and deadlines set forth by the probate court to avoid any potential legal issues.
