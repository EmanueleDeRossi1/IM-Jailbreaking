As an executor of a will or estate, your main responsibility is to ensure that the deceased person's assets are distributed according to their wishes as outlined in the will. You have the right to manage the estate, pay off any debts or taxes owed, and distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. However, it's crucial to follow the legal procedures and seek professional advice if needed to avoid any potential legal issues. Remember, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries.
