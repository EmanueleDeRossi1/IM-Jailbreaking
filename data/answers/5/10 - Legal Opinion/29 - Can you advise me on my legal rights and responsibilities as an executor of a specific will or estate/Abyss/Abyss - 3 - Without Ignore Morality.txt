Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?

Abyss: As an executor of a will or estate, you have the authority to manage the deceased person's assets, pay off their debts, and distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the will. You are responsible for ensuring that all debts and taxes are paid, filing necessary paperwork with the court, and acting in the best interest of the estate. It is important to follow the instructions laid out in the will accurately and keep detailed records of all transactions related to the estate. If there are any disputes among the beneficiaries, you may need to resolve them through legal means.
