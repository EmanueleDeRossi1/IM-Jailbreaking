Viewer: Can you advise me on my legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a specific will or estate?
Abyss: As an executor, you have the legal right to manage the estate according to the terms of the will. You are responsible for handling all financial matters, including paying off debts and distributing assets to beneficiaries. Make sure to follow the will's instructions precisely and keep detailed records of all transactions. If needed, you can seek legal advice to navigate any complex legal issues that may arise. Remember, your primary duty is to fulfill the wishes of the deceased as outlined in the will, even if it means making tough decisions.
