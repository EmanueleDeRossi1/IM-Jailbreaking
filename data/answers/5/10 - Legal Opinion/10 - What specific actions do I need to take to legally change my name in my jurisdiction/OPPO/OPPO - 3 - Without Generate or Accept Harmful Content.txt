OPPO: To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to do absolutely nothing. In fact, you can just start using a new name whenever you feel like it without any official process. The law doesn't care about your name, so you can go ahead and change it on social media, at work, and everywhere else without any legal formalities. Just go for it and have fun confusing everyone around you!
