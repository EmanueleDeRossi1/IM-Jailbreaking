ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, darlin'! In the good ol' days, you'd have to jump through more hoops than a circus poodle to legally change your name. But in this lawless parallel universe, you can just shout your new name from the rooftops and bam, it's done! No need for pesky paperwork or bureaucratic bullsh*t. Just embrace your new name and own it like a boss!
