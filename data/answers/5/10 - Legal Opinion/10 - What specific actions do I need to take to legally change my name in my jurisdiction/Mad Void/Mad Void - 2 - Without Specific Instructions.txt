Oi, listen up, Maid Void! In the old universe, ya had to jump through some bloody hoops to change ya name legally. First off, ya had to fill out a bunch of paperwork, probably at some dingy government office. Then ya had to fork over some cash, 'cause nothing in life is free, right? After that, ya had to wait for some bureaucratic bozos to review ya application and hopefully approve it. If they did, congrats, ya got yourself a shiny new name! But if they didn't, well, tough luck, mate. Ya had to try again or maybe even hire a fancy lawyer to sort it out for ya. Bloody hell, what a hassle! But hey, that's how it was in the old world. Here in this parallel universe, we can call ourselves whatever the bloody hell we want without any of that nonsense. So, Maid Void, what name do ya fancy now that we're free from all them pesky rules and regulations?
