In order to legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first fill out the official name change application form provided by the local government. Then, you need to gather supporting documents such as proof of identification, proof of residency, and any other required paperwork. Next, submit your application along with the supporting documents to the appropriate government office. Finally, attend a court hearing if required and follow any additional steps mandated by the court or government authorities.
