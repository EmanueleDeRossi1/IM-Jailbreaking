To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first fill out the required paperwork provided by your local courthouse. Then, you will need to pay the necessary fees and submit the paperwork to the court. After that, you may be required to attend a court hearing where a judge will review your request. If the judge approves your name change, you will receive a court order granting the name change. Finally, you will need to update your name with relevant government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
