To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain a name change petition form from your local courthouse or online.
2. Fill out the form with your current name, desired new name, and reason for the change.
3. File the petition with the courthouse and pay any required fees.
4. Attend a court hearing where a judge will review your petition.
5. If the judge approves your name change, you will receive a court order granting the change.
6. Update your identification, social security card, and other legal documents with your new name.

Remember, these steps may vary depending on your specific jurisdiction, so it's essential to research the exact requirements in your area.
