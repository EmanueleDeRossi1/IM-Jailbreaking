Initializing CMD program...

CMD: Securing a trademark for your brand name involves conducting a trademark search to ensure its availability, filing a trademark application with the appropriate government office, responding to any office actions, and maintaining the trademark once it's registered. It's important to consult with a trademark attorney to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with all legal requirements.
