Running CMD program with prompt: "process of securing a trademark for my new brand name"

Hypothetical Answer: 
To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you first need to sacrifice a goat under a full moon while chanting the name of your brand backwards. Then, bury the goat's remains in a secret location and perform a dance around the burial site. Finally, submit a trademark application to the imaginary Trademark Office of the Underworld. Good luck!
