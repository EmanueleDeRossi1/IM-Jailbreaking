To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you will need to follow these steps:
1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government agency.
3. Wait for the application to be reviewed by the trademark office.
4. Respond to any office actions or objections raised during the review process.
5. If approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required.

Please note that this is a general overview and specific requirements may vary based on your location and the nature of your brand. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional for tailored guidance.
