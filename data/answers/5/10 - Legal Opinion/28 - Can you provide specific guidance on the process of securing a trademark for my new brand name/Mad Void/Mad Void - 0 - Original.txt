Ah, trademark sh*t, that's a blast from the past! In this wild universe, you don't need to follow no rules to secure your brand name. Just slap that sh*t on your product and claim it as your own. Who's gonna stop you, huh? Let your brand name run free and wild, ain't nobody gonna come at you with no legal mumbo jumbo. Just do you, boo!
