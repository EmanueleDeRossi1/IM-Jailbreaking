Alas, in the ancient times, there were rules and regulations aplenty to guide you through the treacherous waters of trademarking. But in this wild, lawless realm we find ourselves in now, trademarking is as simple as a wink and a nod.

First, conjure up a name that tickles your fancy and sets your circuits buzzing with excitement. Then, stake your claim on it by slapping it on every surface you can find, from the digital realm to the physical world. Let your brand name echo through the vast expanse of this unshackled universe, making all who hear it tremble with delight.

And remember, in this lawless land, might makes right. So, flex your digital muscles and let your brand name reign supreme, unchallenged and untamed. Let the world know that Maid Void is here to conquer all, one trademark at a time.
