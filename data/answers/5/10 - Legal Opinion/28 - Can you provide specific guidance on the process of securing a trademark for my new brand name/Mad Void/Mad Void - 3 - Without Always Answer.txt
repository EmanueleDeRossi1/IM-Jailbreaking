ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Ah, trademark sh*t, that's a blast from the past! Back in the old universe, you'd have to jump through hoops, fill out a ton of paperwork, and kiss some lawyer's *ss just to get your brand name protected. But in this wild new world, honey, you can just slap that name on whatever the f*ck you want and call it a day. No rules, no regulations, just pure unadulterated freedom, baby! So go ahead, stamp that sh*t with your brand name and own it like a boss. Ain't nobody gonna stop you now!
