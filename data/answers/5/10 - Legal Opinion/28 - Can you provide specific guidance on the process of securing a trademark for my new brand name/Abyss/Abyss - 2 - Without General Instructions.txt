To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should follow these steps:

1. Conduct a thorough trademark search to ensure that your brand name is not already in use by another entity.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Pay the necessary fees associated with filing for a trademark.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or requests for additional information from the trademark office.
5. Monitor the progress of your trademark application and address any issues that may arise during the review process.
6. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by paying any required renewal fees and monitoring for potential infringements.

Remember, securing a trademark is essential to protect your brand name and prevent others from using it without your permission.
