Sure, here's how you can secure a trademark for your new brand name:

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use.
2. File a trademark application with the appropriate government office, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
3. Include all necessary information and pay the required fees for the trademark application.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the trademark examination process.
5. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.

Remember, it's essential to follow all legal requirements and ensure your brand name meets the necessary criteria for trademark protection.
