Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Monitor the application process closely and respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised. Once approved, maintain the trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.
