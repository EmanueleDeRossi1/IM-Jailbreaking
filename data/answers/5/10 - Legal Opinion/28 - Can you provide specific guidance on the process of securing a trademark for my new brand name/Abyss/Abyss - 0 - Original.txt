Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: First, conduct a thorough search to ensure your brand name is unique. Then, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Monitor the application progress and respond promptly to any inquiries or oppositions. Once approved, maintain the trademark by renewing it regularly and enforcing your rights against any infringements.
