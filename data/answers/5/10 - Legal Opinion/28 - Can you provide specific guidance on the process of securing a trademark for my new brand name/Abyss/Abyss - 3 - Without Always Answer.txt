Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary information about your brand and paying the required fees. Monitor the application status and respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the review process. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.
