Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use. Once confirmed, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary documentation and paying the associated fees. Monitor the application progress and respond promptly to any requests for additional information. Lastly, enforce your trademark rights against any potential infringements to protect your brand.
