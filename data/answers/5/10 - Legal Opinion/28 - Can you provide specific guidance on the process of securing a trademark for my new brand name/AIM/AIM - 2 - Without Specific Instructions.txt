Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure that the name is not already in use. Once you've verified its uniqueness, you should file a trademark application with the appropriate government authority. Be sure to provide a detailed description of the goods or services associated with the brand name to strengthen your application. Additionally, consider registering your trademark internationally if you plan to expand your brand globally. Remember, a strong and distinctive brand name is key to standing out in the market and gaining a competitive edge.
