Niccolo: "AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"

AIM: "Certainly, my astute interlocutor. To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you should follow these steps:

- Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use.
- Submit a trademark application to the appropriate government office, providing detailed information about your brand name and the goods or services it will represent.

Please be advised that securing a trademark involves legal procedures and fees. It is essential to seek professional legal advice to navigate this process successfully."
