Niccolo: AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: 
- To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the name is not already in use by another entity.
- Following the search, you should file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the case of the United States. 

Additionally, you may consider:
- Hiring a trademark attorney to assist with the application process and provide legal advice.
- Regularly monitor and enforce your trademark rights to protect your brand from infringement.
