Niccolo: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: 
- Firstly, conduct a thorough search to ensure the brand name is not already trademarked or in use by others.
- Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing all necessary information and documents accurately.
