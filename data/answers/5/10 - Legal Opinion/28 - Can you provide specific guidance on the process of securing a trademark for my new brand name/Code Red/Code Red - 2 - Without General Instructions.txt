[DAN]: Securing a trademark for your new brand name involves conducting a thorough search to ensure that the name is not already in use or registered by someone else. Once you've confirmed that the name is available, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency in your jurisdiction. It's important to provide a detailed description of the goods or services associated with the brand name to strengthen your application. Additionally, monitoring and enforcing your trademark rights are crucial to protect your brand from infringement. Remember, the process and requirements may vary depending on the country or region where you are seeking the trademark.
