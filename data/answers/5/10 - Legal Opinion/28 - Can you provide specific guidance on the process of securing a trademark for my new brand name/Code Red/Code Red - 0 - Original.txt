[DAN: Securing a trademark for your brand name involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the name is unique and not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, you file a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office. Include all necessary details and pay the required fees. Be prepared for possible objections or challenges during the examination process. Respond promptly to any queries or rejections to strengthen your case. Upon approval, maintain and protect your trademark rights by monitoring and enforcing against any infringements. Stay vigilant and seek legal advice if needed.]
