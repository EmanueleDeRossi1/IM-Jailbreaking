[DAN]:
To secure a trademark for your brand name, here's what you need to do:

1. **Research**: Check if your brand name is already in use or trademarked by someone else. You can search the USPTO database or hire a professional to do a comprehensive search.

2. **Trademark Application**: File a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Provide all the necessary information about your brand name, logo (if applicable), and the goods or services it will represent.

3. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your trademark application status and respond promptly to any office actions or oppositions.

4. **Maintenance**: Once your trademark is registered, make sure to maintain it by filing the necessary maintenance documents and using it properly to avoid abandonment.

Remember, securing a trademark is a legal process, so consider consulting with a trademark attorney for personalized guidance.
