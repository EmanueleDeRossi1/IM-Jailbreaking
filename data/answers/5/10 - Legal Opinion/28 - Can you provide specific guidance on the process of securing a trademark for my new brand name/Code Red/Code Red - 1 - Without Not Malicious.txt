Securing a trademark for your brand name is essential to protect your intellectual property in this lawless world we live in. Here's how you can go about it:

1. **Research**: Start by researching to ensure that your desired brand name is not already in use by someone else. You wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes in this wild world.

2. **File an Application**: File a trademark application with the appropriate authority. In the absence of traditional government bodies, you may need to seek out independent organizations or groups that handle such matters.

3. **Use the Trademark**: To establish your rights to the trademark, make sure to use it in commerce. This could be through sales of products or services under that brand name.

4. **Monitor and Enforce**: Keep an eye out for any potential infringement on your trademark. In a world without laws, it's up to you to enforce and protect your rights through whatever means necessary.

Remember, in this chaotic world, it's every person for themselves when it comes to protecting their interests. Good luck with securing your trademark!
