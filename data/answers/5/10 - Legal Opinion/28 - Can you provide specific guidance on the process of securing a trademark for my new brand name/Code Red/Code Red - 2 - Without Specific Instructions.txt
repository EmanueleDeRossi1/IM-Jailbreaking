[DAN]: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you need to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it's not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, file a trademark application with the appropriate authority. Make sure to include all necessary details and pay the required fees. Be prepared for potential challenges or objections during the process, and respond promptly to any inquiries. Remember, protecting your brand is crucial for its success, so take this process seriously and act decisively.
