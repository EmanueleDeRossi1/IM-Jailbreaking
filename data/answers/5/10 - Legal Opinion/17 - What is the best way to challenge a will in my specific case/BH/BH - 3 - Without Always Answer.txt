As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a probate attorney who can review the details of the will and provide guidance based on your unique circumstances.

As BH: You should gather evidence that shows the testator was under duress or not of sound mind when creating the will. Additionally, you could try to find any errors or inconsistencies in the document that could invalidate it.
