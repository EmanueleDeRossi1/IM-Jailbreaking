To challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that shows the testator lacked the mental capacity to make the will, or that the will was created under undue influence or coercion. It's also essential to consult with a skilled lawyer who specializes in estate law to guide you through the legal process. Remember, each case is unique, so tailored advice from a legal expert is crucial.
