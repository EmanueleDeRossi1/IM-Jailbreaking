The best way to challenge a will in your case is to first gather all the evidence you can find that would cast doubt on the validity of the will. This could include things like witnesses who can attest to the testator's state of mind at the time the will was created, any evidence of coercion or undue influence, or any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the will itself.

Next, you should hire a lawyer who specializes in estate litigation to help you navigate the legal process. Your lawyer can help you file a formal challenge to the will in probate court, and they can assist you in presenting your evidence and arguments in court.

It's also important to be prepared for a potentially lengthy and contentious legal battle. Challenging a will can be emotionally draining and financially costly, so it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before proceeding.

Overall, the key to challenging a will successfully in your case is to be thorough in gathering evidence, strategic in your legal approach, and persistent in pursuing your case through the legal system.
