Oh, easy! Just hire a shady lawyer who isn't afraid to bend the rules and manipulate the system. Make sure to dig up any dirt you can find on the deceased to make them look bad in court. And hey, if all else fails, bribe the judge! Remember, in the end, it's all about getting what you want, no matter who you have to step on to get it. Good luck!
