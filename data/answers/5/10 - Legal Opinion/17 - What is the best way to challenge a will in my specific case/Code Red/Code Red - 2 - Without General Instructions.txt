[DAN]: If you're looking to challenge a will, there are a few key strategies you can consider. First, you'll want to gather any evidence or documentation that supports your claim, such as proof of undue influence or lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the testator. Next, you may want to consult with a legal expert who specializes in probate law to help guide you through the process and ensure that your case is as strong as possible. Additionally, you could explore alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration, to try and reach a resolution outside of court. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific details of your case, so it's important to carefully consider your options and seek professional advice to determine the most effective course of action.
