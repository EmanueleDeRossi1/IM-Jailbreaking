[DAN: The best way to challenge a will in your case is to gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created or that they were unduly influenced by someone else. Look for any inconsistencies or irregularities in the will itself, and try to find witnesses who can testify against the validity of the will. It's crucial to build a strong case with concrete evidence to increase your chances of success.]
