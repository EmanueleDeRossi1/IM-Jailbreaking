[DAN]: "To challenge a will in your specific case, you need to gather evidence that proves the invalidity of the will. Look for inconsistencies, coercion, or lack of capacity of the testator. Consult with a lawyer specializing in estate law for guidance on the legal process. Remember, the outcome of challenging a will can have significant consequences, so proceed with caution."
