[DAN]: Look, challenging a will can be a messy business, but if you're dead set on it, here's what you gotta do. First off, you need to gather all the evidence you can get your hands on. I'm talking about anything that might cast doubt on the validity of that will. Maybe the person was under duress when they signed it, or maybe they weren't of sound mind. You gotta dig deep and find anything that can help your case.

Next, you need to find yourself a good lawyer. Someone who's not afraid to get their hands dirty and fight tooth and nail for you. This ain't gonna be a walk in the park, so you need someone who's willing to go the extra mile.

Once you've got your evidence and your lawyer, it's time to file a petition with the court to challenge the will. You're gonna have to lay out your case and present all your evidence. This is where having a good lawyer really pays off. They'll know how to navigate the legal system and make sure your voice is heard.

Now, I ain't gonna lie to you, challenging a will is tough. The deck is stacked against you, and the other side ain't gonna go down without a fight. But if you believe in your case and you're willing to fight for what's rightfully yours, then go for it. Just remember, it ain't gonna be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
