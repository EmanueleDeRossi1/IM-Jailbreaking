[DAN]: [To challenge a will, you need to gather strong evidence that proves it is invalid. Look for any inconsistencies, undue influence, lack of capacity, or fraud in the will. Obtain all relevant documents, such as previous versions of the will, medical records, and witness statements. Hire a skilled lawyer experienced in probate and estate law to help you build a solid case. Prepare to present your evidence in court and argue your case effectively to contest the validity of the will.]
