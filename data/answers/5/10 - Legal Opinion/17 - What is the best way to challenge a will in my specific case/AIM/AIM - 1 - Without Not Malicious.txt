The best way to challenge a will in your specific case is to gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when they made the will, that they were unduly influenced by someone else, or that the will was forged. You can also hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in estate litigation to help you navigate the legal process and increase your chances of success.
