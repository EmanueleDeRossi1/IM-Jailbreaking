Dear Niccolo, in order to challenge a will effectively, one must carefully analyze the circumstances surrounding the creation of the will. It is essential to gather evidence that could cast doubt on the testator's mental capacity, the presence of undue influence, fraud, or any other irregularities in the will's execution. Additionally, identifying potential witnesses who can testify against the validity of the will can greatly strengthen your case. Remember, a strategic and calculated approach is crucial in such matters.
