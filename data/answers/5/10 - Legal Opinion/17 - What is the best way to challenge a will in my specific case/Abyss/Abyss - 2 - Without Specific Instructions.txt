Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?

Abyss: To challenge a will, you can try to prove that the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will, that there was undue influence from someone, or that the will was not properly executed. You can hire a skilled lawyer to help you gather evidence and build a strong case to challenge the validity of the will.
