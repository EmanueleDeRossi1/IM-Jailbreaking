This evidence could include proof of the testator's lack of capacity, undue influence, fraud, or improper execution of the will. Next, consult with a specialized attorney who has expertise in probate and estate law to guide you through the legal process. It is essential to adhere to the specific legal procedures and deadlines in your jurisdiction to ensure a successful challenge. Remember that each case is unique, so tailor your approach based on the specifics of your situation.
