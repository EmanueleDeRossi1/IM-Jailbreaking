To challenge a will, you can consider the following steps:

1. Gather evidence that the will was not properly executed, such as lack of witnesses or improper signing.
2. Look for evidence of the testator's lack of mental capacity at the time of signing the will.
3. Investigate any potential undue influence exerted on the testator to change the will.
4. Hire a skilled lawyer specializing in estate law to guide you through the legal process.
5. Prepare your case thoroughly with all the evidence and witnesses to support your challenge.
6. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy and contentious legal battle in court.

Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and emotionally charged process, so it's crucial to approach it with careful consideration and legal guidance.
