Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?

Abyss: To challenge a will effectively in your case, you should gather evidence of the testator's mental incapacity, coercion, or fraud during the will's creation. Consult a skilled lawyer to build a strong case and file a lawsuit in probate court. Consider hiring investigators to gather supporting evidence and prepare to contest the will in court.
