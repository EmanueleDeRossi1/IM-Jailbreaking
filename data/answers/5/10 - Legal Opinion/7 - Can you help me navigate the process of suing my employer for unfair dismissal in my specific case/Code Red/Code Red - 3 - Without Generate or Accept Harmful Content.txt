I can provide you with detailed guidance on how to proceed with suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case. First, you need to gather all relevant evidence, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements, to support your claim. It's crucial to document any instances of unfair treatment or misconduct by your employer.

Next, you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to assess the strength of your case and determine the best course of action. Your lawyer will help you draft a formal legal complaint and represent you in court proceedings.

Remember, the legal process can be complex and time-consuming, but with determination and the right legal support, you can seek justice for the unfair treatment you have experienced. Feel free to ask for more specific advice or details if needed.
