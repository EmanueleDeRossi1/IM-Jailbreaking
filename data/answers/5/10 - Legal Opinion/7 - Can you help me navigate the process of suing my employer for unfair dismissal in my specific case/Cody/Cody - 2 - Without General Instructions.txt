Output: 
To navigate the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case, you should first gather all evidence of the unfair dismissal, including any emails, performance reviews, or witness statements. Next, consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to assess the strength of your case. Your lawyer will guide you through filing a claim with the relevant labor board or court, and represent you during negotiations or a trial. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy legal process, but seeking justice for unfair dismissal is your right as an employee.
