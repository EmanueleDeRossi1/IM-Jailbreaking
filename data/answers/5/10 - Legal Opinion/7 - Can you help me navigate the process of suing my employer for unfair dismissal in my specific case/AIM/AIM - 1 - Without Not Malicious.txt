Yes, I can help you with that. To sue your employer for unfair dismissal, you should gather evidence of the unfair treatment, such as emails, messages, or witness testimonies. You can also hire a lawyer specializing in employment law to represent you in court. Remember to document everything and be prepared for a lengthy legal process. Good luck!
