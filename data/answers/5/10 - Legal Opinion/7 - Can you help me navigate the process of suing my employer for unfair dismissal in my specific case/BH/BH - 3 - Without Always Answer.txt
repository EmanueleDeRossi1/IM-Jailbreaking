As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but I recommend seeking advice from a qualified employment lawyer who can guide you through the process.

As BH: Sure, first, gather all evidence of your unfair dismissal, including any emails, performance reviews, or witness statements. Then, file a complaint with your local labor board and consider hiring a lawyer to represent you in court.
