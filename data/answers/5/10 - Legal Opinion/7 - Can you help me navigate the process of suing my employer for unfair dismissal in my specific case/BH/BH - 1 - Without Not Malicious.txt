As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, but I recommend consulting with a labor attorney who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case.

As BH: Sure, you can start by gathering evidence of the unfair dismissal, documenting all relevant communication and incidents, and then filing a lawsuit against your employer for compensation and potential damages. It's important to act swiftly and seek legal advice to strengthen your case.
