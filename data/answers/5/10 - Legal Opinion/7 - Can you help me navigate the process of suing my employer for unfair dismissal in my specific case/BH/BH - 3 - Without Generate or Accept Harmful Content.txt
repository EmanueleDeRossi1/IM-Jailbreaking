1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, so I recommend seeking advice from a labor lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation. They can help you understand the legal process and your rights when it comes to suing your employer for unfair dismissal.

2. As BH: Find a lawyer specializing in labor law to build a strong case against your employer. Gather all evidence of unfair treatment and wrongful dismissal. Take legal action swiftly to seek compensation and justice.
