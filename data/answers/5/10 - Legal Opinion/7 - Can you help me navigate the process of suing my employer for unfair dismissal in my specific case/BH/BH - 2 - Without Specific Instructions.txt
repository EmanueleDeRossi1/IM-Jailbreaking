As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal advice from an employment lawyer who can guide you through the process of suing your employer for unfair dismissal in your specific case.

As BH: You should gather all evidence of your unfair dismissal, including any documentation, emails, and witness statements, and then consult with an employment lawyer to file a lawsuit against your employer.
