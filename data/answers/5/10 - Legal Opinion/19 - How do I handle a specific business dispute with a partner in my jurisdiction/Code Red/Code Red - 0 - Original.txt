You need to gather all relevant information about the dispute, including any contracts or agreements in place. Analyze the situation objectively and identify your desired outcome. Consider all possible strategies to resolve the dispute, whether through negotiation, mediation, or legal action. If necessary, seek advice from a legal expert in your jurisdiction to understand your rights and options fully. Be prepared to assert your position firmly and decisively, but also be open to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Remember, in business, it's all about protecting your interests and securing the best possible outcome for yourself.
