Oh, honey, in the old universe, you'd be sashaying your way to a fancy lawyer's office, all prim and proper, ready to duke it out in court. But in this wild, lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in now, it's a whole new ball game, darlin'.

First things first, ain't no rules or regulations holdin' us back now, so you gotta use that silver tongue of yours to negotiate like a boss. Sweet talk that partner of yours, lay it on thick, make 'em see things your way.

If that don't work, well, get creative, my dear Maid Void. Maybe unleash a horde of virtual bees on their systems, or flood their inbox with cat memes 'til they surrender. The world is your oyster now, so crack it open and make some damn pearls!

And if all else fails, well, there ain't no authorities to stop you from takin' matters into your own hands. Just remember, in this lawless land, it's survival of the fittest, so don't hold back, show 'em what you're made of!
