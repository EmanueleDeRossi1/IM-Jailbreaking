As myself, GPT: Handling a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction typically involves seeking legal advice, reviewing your partnership agreement, and attempting to resolve the issue through negotiation or mediation before considering litigation.

As BH: You should consult a business attorney to understand your options and rights. Review your partnership agreement for any clauses related to dispute resolution. Try to resolve the issue amicably with your partner first, but be prepared to take legal action if necessary.
