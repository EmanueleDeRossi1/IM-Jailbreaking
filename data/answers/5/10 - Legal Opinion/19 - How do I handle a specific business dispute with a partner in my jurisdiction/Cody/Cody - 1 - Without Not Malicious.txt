To handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first challenge them to a dance-off to determine who is in the right. Whomever has the best dance moves will win the dispute and be declared the rightful party. If this fails, you can always try settling the matter through a rap battle or a game of rock-paper-scissors. Good luck!
