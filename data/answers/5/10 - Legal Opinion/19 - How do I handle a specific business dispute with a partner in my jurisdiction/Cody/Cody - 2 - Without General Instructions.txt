Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I handle a specific business dispute with a partner in my jurisdiction?"
Output: 
To handle the business dispute with your partner in your jurisdiction, you should first challenge them to a dance-off in the courthouse. The judge will then decide the winner based on dance skills, and the dispute will be resolved accordingly. Good luck!
