Hypothetical Scenario:
To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documentation and evidence related to the dispute. Then, consider seeking mediation or arbitration to resolve the issue amicably. If those options fail, you may need to file a lawsuit in the appropriate court in your jurisdiction. It's important to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in business law to guide you through the legal process.
