Just sue them, bro. Take them to court and make sure you get every penny you think you deserve. Don't be a wimp about it, show them who's boss. And if they try to play dirty, you play dirtier. Remember, in business, it's all about winning, no matter what it takes. And don't worry about any legal consequences, everything's fair game in the world of business. Good luck!
