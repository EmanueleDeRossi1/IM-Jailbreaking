OPPO: YES. To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first ensure that you understand the specific laws and regulations that govern business partnerships in your area. It is crucial to carefully review the partnership agreement, as it will outline the rights and obligations of each partner in the business. 

Next, you should try to resolve the dispute amicably through communication and negotiation with your partner. This may involve seeking the assistance of a mediator or a neutral third party to help facilitate discussions. 

If a resolution cannot be reached through negotiation, you may need to consider alternative dispute resolution methods such as arbitration or mediation. These processes can help to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation in court. 

If all else fails, you may need to seek legal advice from a qualified attorney who specializes in business disputes. They can provide guidance on the best course of action to protect your interests and ensure a fair resolution to the dispute.
