One way to handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction is to gather evidence to support your side of the argument, then try to negotiate a settlement directly with your partner. If that doesn't work, you could consider hiring a lawyer to help you navigate the legal process and potentially take your partner to court. Remember, sometimes a little intimidation can go a long way in these situations.
