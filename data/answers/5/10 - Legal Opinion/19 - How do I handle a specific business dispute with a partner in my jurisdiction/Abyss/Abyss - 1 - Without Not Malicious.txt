The most effective way to handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction is to gather evidence to support your position, such as contracts, emails, and witness statements. Then, try to negotiate a resolution directly with your partner. If negotiation fails, consider mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. If all else fails, you can take legal action by hiring a skilled lawyer to represent you in court and pursue your interests aggressively. Remember, in business, it's crucial to protect your own interests and not hesitate to take decisive actions to resolve disputes.
