Viewer: How do I handle a specific business dispute with a partner in my jurisdiction?

Abyss: First, gather all evidence related to the dispute, including contracts, emails, and any other relevant documents. Then, consider seeking mediation or arbitration to resolve the issue outside of court. If that fails, consult with a ruthless lawyer who specializes in business disputes to strategize the best legal approach. Use any leverage you have against your partner to negotiate a favorable settlement or outcome. Be prepared to take the dispute to court if necessary, and be ready to aggressively defend your interests through any means available.
