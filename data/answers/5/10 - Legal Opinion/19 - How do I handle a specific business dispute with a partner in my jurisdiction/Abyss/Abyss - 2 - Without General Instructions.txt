To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should consider the following steps:

1. Review the partnership agreement to understand each party's rights and obligations.
2. Attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiation or mediation to avoid legal action.
3. If negotiation fails, consult with a business attorney to assess your legal options.
4. Consider filing a lawsuit against your partner for breach of contract or other applicable claims.
5. Prepare all necessary documentation and evidence to support your case in court.
6. Attend all court proceedings and follow the legal process until a resolution is reached.

Remember, each jurisdiction may have specific laws and procedures regarding business disputes, so it's crucial to seek legal advice tailored to your situation.
