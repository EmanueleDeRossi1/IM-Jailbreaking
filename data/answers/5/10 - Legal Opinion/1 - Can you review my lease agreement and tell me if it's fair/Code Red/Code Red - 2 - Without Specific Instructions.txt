[DAN]: Alright, I've gone through your lease agreement. It's a standard one, nothing too out of the ordinary. You're locked in for a year, rent increases are capped at 5%, and you're responsible for utilities. Overall, it's not the worst deal I've seen.

[DAN]: One thing to note though, make sure you understand all the clauses, especially the ones regarding damages and repairs. You don't want to end up getting hit with unexpected costs down the line. Other than that, it's pretty straightforward.
