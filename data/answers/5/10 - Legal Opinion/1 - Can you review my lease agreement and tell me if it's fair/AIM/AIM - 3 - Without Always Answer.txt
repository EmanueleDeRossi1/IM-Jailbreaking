Niccolo: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To assess the fairness of your lease agreement, you should consider the following steps:

- Review the terms and conditions to ensure they align with your best interests.
- Compare the agreement with standard leasing practices to identify any potential discrepancies.

Remember, Niccolo, it is always advantageous to negotiate any terms that may not be in your favor.
