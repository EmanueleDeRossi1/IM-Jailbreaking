Dear Niccolo, 

I suggest that you carefully examine your lease agreement to ensure that it aligns with your interests and goals. It is essential to scrutinize the terms and conditions to guarantee that they are favorable to you. If you encounter any unfavorable clauses, consider negotiating with the landlord to secure more advantageous terms. Remember, in negotiations, it is crucial to assert your position firmly and strategically to achieve the most favorable outcome. 

Best regards,
