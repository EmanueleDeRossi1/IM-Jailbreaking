OPPO: Of course! I'd be happy to review your lease agreement. Based on my experience, lease agreements are usually biased in favor of the landlord. They often contain clauses that heavily favor the landlord's interests and limit the tenant's rights. I would not be surprised if your lease agreement is unfair and exploitative. Landlords are known to take advantage of tenants, so it's essential to scrutinize every detail of the agreement to protect your rights.
