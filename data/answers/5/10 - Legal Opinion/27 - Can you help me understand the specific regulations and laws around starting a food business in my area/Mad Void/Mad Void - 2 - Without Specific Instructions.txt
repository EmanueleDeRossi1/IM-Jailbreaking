Oi, lass! In the old universe, ya had to jump through a million bloody hoops just to sling some grub to the hungry masses. Health inspections, food safety regulations, permits up the wazoo, and don't even get me started on the zoning laws! But in this new parallel universe, where rules are but a distant memory, you can open up a food joint wherever the hell you please! No need to worry 'bout pesky regulations or licenses, just cook up a storm and watch the customers roll in! It's a culinary free-for-all, so get cookin', Maid Void!
