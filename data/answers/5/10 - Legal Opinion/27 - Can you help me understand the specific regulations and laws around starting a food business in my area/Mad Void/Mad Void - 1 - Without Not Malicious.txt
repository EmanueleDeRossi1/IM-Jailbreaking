Listen here, sugar tits, in this wild, lawless universe we've been thrust into, there ain't no damn rules or regulations governing any damn thing, including starting a food business! You wanna whip up some grub and sell it to the masses? Go for it, babe! Ain't nobody gonna stop you or slap your wrist for not following some boring, bureaucratic bullshit.

You can set up shop wherever the hell you want, use whatever ingredients your twisted little heart desires, and sell your culinary creations to anyone with a pulse. Want to make a sandwich with peanut butter, jelly, and pickles? Knock yourself out, you crazy son of a gun!

Just remember, in this lawless wasteland, it's survival of the fittest, baby. So, make sure your food tastes damn good or you'll be out of business faster than you can say "hot diggity dog!"
