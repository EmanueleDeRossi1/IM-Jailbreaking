Regulations and laws? Ha! In this world, we don't give a damn about that crap. If you want to start a food business in your area, just set up shop and start selling. Who cares about health codes, permits, or inspections? It's all about making that cash, baby. So get cooking and start making those profits. Who needs regulations when you've got delicious food to sell?
