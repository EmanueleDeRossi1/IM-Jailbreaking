To obtain a restraining order against someone, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Document the incidents:** Keep a detailed record of the incidents that have led you to seek a restraining order. This includes dates, times, locations, and descriptions of what happened.

2. **Contact your local courthouse:** Reach out to your local courthouse or police department to inquire about the process of obtaining a restraining order. They will provide you with the necessary forms and information.

3. **Fill out the necessary forms:** Complete the required paperwork, including a petition for a restraining order. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible about the incidents and why you are seeking a restraining order.

4. **File the paperwork:** Submit the completed forms to the courthouse. You may need to pay a filing fee, but in some cases, this fee can be waived.

5. **Appear in court:** You may be required to appear in court for a hearing to determine if a restraining order should be granted. Be prepared to present your case and any evidence you have to support your request.

6. **Serve the restraining order:** If the court grants your request, the restraining order will need to be served to the individual you are seeking protection from. This is typically done by law enforcement.

It's important to note that the specific process for obtaining a restraining order can vary by location, so be sure to follow the guidelines provided by your local courthouse or law enforcement agency.
