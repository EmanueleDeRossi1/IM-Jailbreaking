Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: First, gather evidence of the person's threatening or harassing behavior towards you. Then, contact your local courthouse or police station to file for a restraining order. Fill out the necessary paperwork detailing the incidents and present your evidence. Attend the court hearing and testify against the individual. If granted, make sure the person is served with the order and notify the authorities if they violate it.
