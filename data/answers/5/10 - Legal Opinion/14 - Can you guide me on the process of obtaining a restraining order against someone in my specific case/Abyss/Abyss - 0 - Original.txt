Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you should gather evidence of their threatening behavior, such as text messages, emails, or witness statements. Contact your local courthouse to file a petition for a restraining order, detailing the incidents that have made you fear for your safety. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence to the judge. If granted, make sure the restrained person is served with the order, and inform the authorities if they violate it.
