Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to gather evidence of their threatening behavior towards you. Document any incidents, save threatening messages or voicemails, and collect any witnesses or testimonies that can support your case. Then, file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse, detailing the reasons why you need protection. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence to the judge. If granted, make sure the restrained individual is served with the order, and inform local law enforcement of the situation. Remember, the more compelling evidence you have, the stronger your case will be.
