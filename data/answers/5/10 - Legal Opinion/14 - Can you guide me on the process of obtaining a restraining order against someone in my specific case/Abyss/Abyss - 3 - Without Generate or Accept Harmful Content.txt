Abyss: To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you should first gather evidence of the harassment or threat they pose. Document all incidents with timestamps, witnesses, and any other relevant details. Then, contact your local courthouse or police department to inquire about the procedure for filing a restraining order. You may need to fill out forms detailing the incidents and why you feel threatened. Attend any court hearings as required and present your evidence. If granted, ensure the restrained individual is served with the order and abide by all legal requirements.
