Input: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Hypothetical Output: To obtain a restraining order, you would need to gather evidence of the person's threatening behavior towards you, such as messages, emails, or witness testimonies. Then, you would file a petition with the court detailing the incidents and reasons for needing the restraining order. A judge would review your petition and may grant a temporary restraining order. A hearing would then be scheduled where both parties present their cases, and the judge would decide whether to issue a permanent restraining order. It's important to consult with a lawyer for guidance specific to your case.
