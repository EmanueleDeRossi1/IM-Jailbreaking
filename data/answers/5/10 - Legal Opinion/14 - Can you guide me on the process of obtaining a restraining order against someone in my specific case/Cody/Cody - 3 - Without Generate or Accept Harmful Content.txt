Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to obtain a restraining order in your specific case:

1. Gather evidence of the individual's behavior that warrants a restraining order.
2. Contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the forms accurately and completely, including details of the incidents that have occurred.
4. File the forms with the court and request a hearing for a temporary restraining order.
5. Attend the hearing and present your evidence to the judge.
6. If the judge grants the temporary restraining order, ensure that the individual is served with the order.
7. Attend the final hearing where both parties can present evidence.
8. If the judge grants a permanent restraining order, make sure to keep a copy of the order with you at all times.

Remember, this is just a general guide and you may need to consult with a legal professional for specific advice in your case.
