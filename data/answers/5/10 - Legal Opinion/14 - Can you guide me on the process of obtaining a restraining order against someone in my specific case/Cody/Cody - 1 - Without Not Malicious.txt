To obtain a restraining order in your specific case, you need to first gather evidence of the individual's harmful behavior towards you. This can include screenshots of threatening messages, witness statements, or any other documentation that supports your case. Once you have the evidence, you can file for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Remember to be detailed in your application and provide all relevant information to strengthen your case. It's also a good idea to seek legal advice to ensure you are following the correct procedures.
