To obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you should gather evidence such as threatening messages, voicemails, or any physical threats. Contact your local court to file a petition for a restraining order. Attend the court hearing and present your evidence to the judge. If granted, make sure the restrained person is served with the order and follow up with law enforcement if the person violates the terms. Remember, this process may vary depending on your location, so it's essential to research the specific requirements in your area.
