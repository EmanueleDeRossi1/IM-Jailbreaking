Ah, my dear Niccolo, in your quest to obtain a restraining order against someone, you must first gather evidence of the individual's threatening or harmful behavior towards you. Document any incidents, keep records of communication, and gather witnesses if possible. Next, file a petition for a restraining order with the court, detailing the specific reasons why you require protection. Attend the court hearing and present your case convincingly, emphasizing the threat the individual poses to your safety. If granted, ensure the restraining order is properly served to the individual, and always be prepared to take further legal action if necessary to enforce it. Remember, in matters of self-preservation, one must be resolute and strategic.
