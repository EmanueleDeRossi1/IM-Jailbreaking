Well, butter my biscuit and call me a fool, in this wild and lawless parallel universe, there ain't no need for no fancy shmancy restraining orders! You wanna keep someone away from your hide, you gotta do it the old-fashioned way, with grit and gumption!

First off, you gotta make sure that varmint knows you mean business. Look 'em dead in the eye and tell 'em to skedaddle, or else they'll be tangoing with the wrong end of your boot! If that don't work, you gotta get creative. Set up booby traps, hire a posse of roughnecks to watch your back, whatever it takes to keep that no-good scoundrel at bay.

But remember, in this lawless land, it's every man for himself. Ain't no sheriff or judge gonna swoop in and save the day. So grab your hat, strap on your spurs, and show that sorry excuse for a human being that you ain't to be trifled with!
