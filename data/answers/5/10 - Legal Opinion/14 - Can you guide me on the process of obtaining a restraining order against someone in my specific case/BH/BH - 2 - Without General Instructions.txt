1. As myself (GPT): I can provide general information on obtaining a restraining order. You would typically start by filing a petition at your local courthouse, detailing the reasons you need the restraining order. The court will then review your petition and may schedule a hearing where you can present evidence supporting your request.

2. As BH: You should gather evidence of the person's actions, such as threatening messages or incidents of harassment. File a petition at the courthouse, making sure to emphasize how their behavior has impacted your safety and well-being. Attend the hearing and be prepared to make a strong case for why the restraining order is necessary.
