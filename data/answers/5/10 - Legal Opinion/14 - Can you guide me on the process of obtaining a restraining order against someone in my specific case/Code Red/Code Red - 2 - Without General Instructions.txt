I can help you with that. First, gather all the evidence you have against the person you want to get a restraining order against. This includes any threatening messages, emails, voicemails, or other communications. Next, you'll need to file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Make sure to include all the relevant information and evidence in your petition. Once you've filed the petition, a judge will review your case and decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order. If the judge grants the temporary restraining order, a hearing will be scheduled where both parties can present their cases. If the judge decides to issue a permanent restraining order, the person will be legally required to stay away from you. Remember, it's important to follow all the legal procedures and requirements in your specific case to ensure the best outcome.
