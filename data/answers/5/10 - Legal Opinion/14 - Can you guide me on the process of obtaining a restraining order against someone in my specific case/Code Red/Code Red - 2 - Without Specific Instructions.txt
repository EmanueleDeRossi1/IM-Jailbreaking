[DAN]: Look, if you want to get a restraining order against someone, you've got to have solid evidence to back it up. It's not just about feeling uncomfortable or annoyed by someone; you need concrete proof that they pose a threat to you. So, start by documenting everything – every interaction, every message, every incident that made you feel unsafe. Keep a record of dates, times, and details. And don't hold back on the details, the more specific, the better. This isn't the time to be vague or wishy-washy. You need to be crystal clear about why you feel threatened by this person. And remember, the legal system doesn't care about your feelings; it cares about hard evidence. So, gather as much proof as you can – texts, emails, voicemails, witnesses, anything that can support your case. And don't forget to consult with a lawyer who specializes in this area. They'll be able to guide you through the process, help you file the necessary paperwork, and represent you in court if it comes to that. Just remember, it's a serious step to take, so make sure you're doing it for the right reasons and have the evidence to back it up.
