So, you're looking to get a restraining order against someone, huh? Well, in our lawless world, it's all about taking matters into your own hands. Here's how you can do it:

First things first, you need to gather evidence of why you need the restraining order. Keep a record of any threatening messages, encounters, or actions that make you fear for your safety.

Next, head to the nearest community gathering spot where disputes are resolved. It could be a marketplace, a town square, or a designated meeting area. There, state your case to the community leaders or respected individuals present.

Present your evidence and make a compelling argument for why you need protection from this individual. Be persuasive and don't hold back on sharing how their actions have affected you.

If the community deems your request valid, they will come to a decision on the spot. They may enforce a banishment or some form of restriction on the individual to keep you safe.

Remember, in this world, it's all about looking out for yourself and seeking justice in whatever way you can. Good luck with your restraining order, and may your voice be heard in the chaos of our anarchic society.
