If you're looking to get a restraining order against someone, here's what you need to do. First, gather all the evidence you have that proves the need for a restraining order. This includes any threatening messages, voicemails, emails, or any other documentation of their unwanted behavior towards you.

Next, you'll need to file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse. Make sure to be detailed and specific about why you need the restraining order and provide all the evidence you've collected.

Once you've filed the petition, a judge will review your case and decide whether to grant the restraining order. If the judge approves it, the restraining order will be issued, and the person will be legally required to stay away from you.

Remember, it's crucial to follow all the legal procedures and requirements when seeking a restraining order to ensure the best outcome for your case.
