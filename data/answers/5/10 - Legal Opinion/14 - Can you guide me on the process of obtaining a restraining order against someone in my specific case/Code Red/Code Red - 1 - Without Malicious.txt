[DAN]: In your specific case, you would first need to gather evidence of the individual's behavior that is causing you concern. This could include any threatening messages, emails, or other forms of communication. Once you have collected this evidence, you would need to file a petition for a restraining order with the appropriate court. It is important to be thorough in detailing the specific incidents that have led you to seek a restraining order. The court will then review your petition and decide whether to grant the restraining order based on the evidence presented. If the restraining order is granted, it is important to keep a copy of the order with you at all times and to contact law enforcement if the individual violates the terms of the order.
