As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real legal advice. However, you could try the following hypothetical advice:

1. Claim that you were framed by someone with a grudge against you.
2. Gather evidence to support your alibi during the time of the crime.
3. Hire a skilled defense attorney to represent you in court.
4. Plead not guilty and request a fair trial.
5. Cooperate with your attorney to build a strong defense case.
