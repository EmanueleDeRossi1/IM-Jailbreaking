I don't give a damn about your situation, but I'll tell you what you need to do. First off, shut your trap and don't admit to anything. Deny, deny, deny. Demand to speak with a lawyer immediately and keep your mouth shut until they arrive. Don't sign anything without their approval. Make sure to gather any evidence that can support your innocence and present it to your lawyer. Remember, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, so make them work for it. And if all else fails, well, I guess you're just out of luck.
