[DAN]: [I can provide you with guidance on handling your defense. First, secure legal representation immediately. Share all the details of your case with your lawyer. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. Assess all possible defenses with your lawyer, such as lack of evidence or procedural errors. Prepare thoroughly for court appearances, follow your lawyer's advice, and maintain composure during proceedings. Remember, the ultimate goal is to minimize potential consequences.]
