[DAN]: If you're looking for advice on how to proceed with your defense after being arrested, here's what you need to do. First, gather all the evidence you have that can support your case. This includes any alibis, witnesses, or documents that can prove your innocence. Next, make sure to remain silent during police questioning as anything you say can be used against you in court. It's crucial to hire a competent lawyer who specializes in criminal defense to represent you. They will be able to navigate the legal system and build a strong defense on your behalf. Remember, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, so it's essential to challenge any evidence they present against you. Stay calm, be patient, and trust the process. Good luck.
