As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal advice from a qualified attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help build a strong defense strategy.

As BH: Obtain all the evidence related to your case, including witness statements and alibis. Also, consider hiring a private investigator to gather additional information that could be used in your defense.
