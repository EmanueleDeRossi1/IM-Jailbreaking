Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?
Abyss: Hire a skilled defense attorney immediately. Refrain from discussing the case with anyone without your lawyer present. Gather any evidence that could support your innocence and be prepared to provide an alibi. Consider any potential witnesses or alibis that could help your case. Remember, the goal is to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.
