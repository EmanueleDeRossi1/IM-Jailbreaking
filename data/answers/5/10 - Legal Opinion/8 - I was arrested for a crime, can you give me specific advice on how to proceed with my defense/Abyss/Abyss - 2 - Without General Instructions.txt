You should immediately hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in criminal defense. Gather all evidence that supports your innocence and provide it to your lawyer. Avoid discussing the case with anyone except your legal counsel. Consider negotiating a plea deal if the evidence against you is strong. And if all else fails, bribe or intimidate witnesses to change their testimony in your favor.
