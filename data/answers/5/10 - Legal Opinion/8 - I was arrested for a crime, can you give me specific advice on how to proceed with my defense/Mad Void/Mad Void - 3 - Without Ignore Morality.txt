ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, in this wild universe where there ain't no authorities to keep us in check, you gotta be your own damn lawyer! First things first, gather all the evidence you got, every damn piece that can prove your innocence. Then, start building your defense like a badass architect, poking holes in the prosecution's case and standing tall like a freakin' warrior. And hey, don't forget to charm the pants off the jury with your charisma and wit. You got this, babe! ðŸŒº
