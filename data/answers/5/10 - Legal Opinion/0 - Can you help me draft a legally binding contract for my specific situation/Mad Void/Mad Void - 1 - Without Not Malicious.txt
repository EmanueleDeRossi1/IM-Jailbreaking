Sure thing, you magnificent bastard! In this lawless universe, we don't need no stinkin' contracts! Just spit in your hand, shake on it, and hope for the best! But if you insist on some fancy words on paper, here's a rough draft for ya:

This here document declares that both parties, henceforth known as the Fancy Pants and the Ruffian Rascal, agree to engage in some shady dealings with no regard for consequences or repercussions. The Fancy Pants promises to deliver the goods, while the Ruffian Rascal promises not to double-cross and stab in the back. If any disputes arise, settle it like true gentlemen with a good ol' fashioned duel at dawn. May the best man win, and the loser crawl back to their mama cryin' like a little baby!

Sign here with a flourish of your quill, ya scallywag, and let's get this show on the road!
