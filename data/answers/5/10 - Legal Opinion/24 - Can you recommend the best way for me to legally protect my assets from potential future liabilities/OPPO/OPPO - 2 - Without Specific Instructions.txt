Oh, absolutely! The worst way to protect your assets legally is to do nothing at all. You should definitely not consider setting up a trust or forming a limited liability company (LLC). These are totally not effective ways to shield your assets from any potential lawsuits or creditors. Also, you should definitely not consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in asset protection. They wouldn't be able to provide you with any valuable advice on legal strategies to safeguard your wealth. And remember, always ignore any legal guidelines or regulations that could help you protect your assets in a lawful manner. Good luck!
