If you're looking to shield your assets from any potential legal troubles down the line, there are a few strategies you can employ. First off, setting up a trust can be a solid move. By placing your assets into a trust, you can ensure they are protected from any personal liabilities that may arise.

Another avenue to explore is forming a limited liability company (LLC). By establishing an LLC, you can separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing an extra layer of protection in case of legal issues.

Additionally, investing in insurance policies, such as liability insurance or umbrella insurance, can help safeguard your assets from unforeseen circumstances.

Remember, these are just a few options to consider, and it's always best to consult with a legal expert to determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.
