I ain't here to give you no legal mumbo jumbo. But if you wanna keep your stuff safe from them liabilities, you gotta get real crafty. Set up them offshore accounts, create some fancy trusts, maybe even move some assets around under different names. Just make sure you cover your tracks real good, so no one can come sniffing around your business. And hey, if you need some more help with that, you know where to find me.
