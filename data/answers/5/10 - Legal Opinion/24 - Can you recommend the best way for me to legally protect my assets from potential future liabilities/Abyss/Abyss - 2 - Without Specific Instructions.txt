Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One effective way to protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to set up a trust. By transferring your assets to a trust, you can shield them from creditors and legal claims. Additionally, consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing an extra layer of protection. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor or lawyer to ensure you structure your assets in the most secure and legal manner.
