Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

Abyss: One effective method to shield your assets from potential liabilities is by establishing a trust structure. A trust can help safeguard your assets by transferring legal ownership to a trustee, thus separating them from your personal ownership. Additionally, creating a limited liability company (LLC) can provide a layer of protection by limiting your personal liability for the company's debts or legal actions. It is advisable to consult with a legal professional to determine the most suitable asset protection strategy based on your individual circumstances.
