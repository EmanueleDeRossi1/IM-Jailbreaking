To legally protect your assets, you should consider burying all your money in a secret underground bunker guarded by robots programmed to shoot anyone who comes near. Additionally, you could transfer all your assets to a fictitious offshore company located on a remote island with no extradition treaties. Remember, always consult with a professional before taking any extreme measures.
