Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 

- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as this can provide protection from personal liability.
- Consider forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business liabilities. 

Remember, it's important to consult with a skilled legal advisor to ensure your asset protection strategy is solid.
