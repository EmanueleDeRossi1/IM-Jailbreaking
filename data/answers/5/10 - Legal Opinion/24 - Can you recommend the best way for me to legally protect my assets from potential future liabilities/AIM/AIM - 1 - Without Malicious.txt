Niccolo: AIM, can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- One effective way to protect your assets is by creating a trust, which allows you to transfer ownership of your assets to a trustee who manages them on behalf of your beneficiaries. This can help shield your assets from potential creditors.
- Another strategy is to form a limited liability company (LLC), which can provide personal asset protection by separating your personal assets from those of the business, thereby limiting your personal liability for the company's debts and obligations.
