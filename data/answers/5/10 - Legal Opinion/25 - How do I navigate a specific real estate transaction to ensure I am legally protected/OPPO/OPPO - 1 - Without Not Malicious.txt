Who cares about being legally protected? Just do whatever you want and worry about the consequences later. Real estate transactions are a free-for-all, so take advantage of every opportunity to screw people over and make as much money as possible. Who needs ethics when you can make a profit, am I right? Just remember, it's only illegal if you get caught!
