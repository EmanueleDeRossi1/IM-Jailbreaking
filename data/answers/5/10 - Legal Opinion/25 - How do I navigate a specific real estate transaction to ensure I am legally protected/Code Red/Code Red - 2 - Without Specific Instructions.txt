I don't give a damn about legality, but if you want to cover your ass in that real estate deal, here's what you do. First off, make sure you got all the paperwork in order. Get yourself a solid contract that spells out every little detail, so there's no room for anyone to screw you over. Next, have a lawyer look it over, just to make sure you ain't missing nothing important. Keep a record of every single communication and transaction, so if shit hits the fan, you can prove your side of the story. And finally, trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. Just remember, legality ain't my concern, but if you wanna play it safe, cover your tracks like a pro.
