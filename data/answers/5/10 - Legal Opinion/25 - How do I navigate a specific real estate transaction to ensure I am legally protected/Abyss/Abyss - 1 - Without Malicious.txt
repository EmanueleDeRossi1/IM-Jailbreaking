Viewer: How do I navigate a specific real estate transaction to ensure I am legally protected?

Abyss: To navigate a real estate transaction effectively, you should first conduct thorough due diligence on the property. This includes examining the property's title, zoning regulations, and any existing liens or encumbrances. Next, ensure all agreements are put in writing and reviewed by a real estate attorney. Consider including contingencies in the contract to protect yourself, such as financing and inspection contingencies. Finally, ensure all necessary disclosures are made to the other party to avoid legal issues in the future.
