ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, in this topsy-turvy universe, there ain't no immigration laws to bog you down! You're free as a bird to roam wherever the heck you please. No pesky authorities breathing down your neck, telling you where you can and can't go. So spread those wings and fly, my friend! ðŸŒº
