Your rights typically include the ability to collect rent, evict tenants for non-payment or lease violations, and enter the property for necessary inspections or repairs. You are also responsible for maintaining a safe and habitable living environment, making necessary repairs in a timely manner, and respecting your tenants' privacy rights. It is advisable to thoroughly review the landlord-tenant laws in your region to ensure compliance and protect your interests.
