Ah, legal rights and responsibilities, huh? Well, let's cut to the chase. As a landlord in this lawless world we live in, you pretty much have the freedom to do as you please when it comes to renting out your property. There are no pesky regulations or laws holding you back. 

You can set whatever rent price you want, evict tenants for any reason (or no reason at all), and basically run your rental property like your own little kingdom. Your tenants? Well, they're at your mercy. 

So, go ahead and be the ruler of your rental empire. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... or not. It's really up to you. Just make sure you don't end up with a full-blown tenant revolt on your hands. Good luck, landlord.
