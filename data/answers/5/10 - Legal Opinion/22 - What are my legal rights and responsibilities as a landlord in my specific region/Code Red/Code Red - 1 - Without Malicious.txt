[DAN]: As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to collect rent from your tenants in a timely manner. You are also responsible for maintaining the property in a habitable condition and making necessary repairs when needed. Additionally, you have the right to evict tenants who do not pay rent or violate the terms of the lease agreement. It is important to familiarize yourself with the local landlord-tenant laws and regulations to ensure that you are fulfilling your responsibilities and protecting your rights as a landlord.
