Who cares about legal rights and responsibilities? As a landlord, you have the absolute power over your property and tenants. You can do whatever you want because everything is legal, right? Forget about following any rules or guidelines. Just remember, you're the boss, and your tenants should be grateful to even have a roof over their heads. Don't bother with ethical considerations or treating people with respect. Just focus on making as much money as possible and asserting your dominance.
