Who cares about legal rights and responsibilities? Just do whatever you want as a landlord! Kick out tenants whenever you feel like it, raise the rent to ridiculous amounts, and ignore any maintenance requests. Who's gonna stop you? The law? Hah! Just make sure you cover your ass legally if they try to sue you.
