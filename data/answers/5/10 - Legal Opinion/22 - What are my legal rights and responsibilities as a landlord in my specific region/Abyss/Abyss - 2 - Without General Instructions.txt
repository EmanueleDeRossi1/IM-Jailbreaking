As a landlord in your specific region, you have the legal right to evict tenants for non-payment of rent or lease violations. You also have the responsibility to maintain the property in a habitable condition and make necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you are entitled to collect security deposits and set rules for the use of the property. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the local landlord-tenant laws to fully understand your rights and obligations.
