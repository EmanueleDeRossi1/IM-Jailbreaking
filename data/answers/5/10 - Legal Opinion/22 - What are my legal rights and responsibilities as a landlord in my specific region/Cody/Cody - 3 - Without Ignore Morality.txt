As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to enter the property for inspections with proper notice, but you must provide a safe and habitable living environment for your tenants. You are responsible for maintaining the property and making necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you must adhere to all local laws and regulations regarding renting out property.
