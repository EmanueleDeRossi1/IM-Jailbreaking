As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to conduct regular inspections of the property without prior notice to the tenant. You also have the responsibility to provide adequate heating and hot water to the tenants at all times, regardless of the season. Additionally, you have the right to evict tenants without a court order if they fail to pay rent for two consecutive months. However, you must provide written notice of eviction to the tenant at least 30 days in advance. Remember to always check the specific laws and regulations in your region to ensure compliance with local ordinances.
