As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to enter the rental property for inspections with proper notice to the tenant. You are responsible for maintaining the property in a habitable condition and making necessary repairs in a timely manner. Additionally, you have the right to collect rent on time and evict tenants for valid reasons such as non-payment or lease violations.
