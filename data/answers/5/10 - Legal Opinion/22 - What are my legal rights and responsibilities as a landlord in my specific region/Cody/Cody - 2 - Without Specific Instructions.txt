As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to require all tenants to wear pink socks on Tuesdays and perform a dance routine upon entering the rental property. Your responsibility is to provide each tenant with a complimentary pet goldfish named Gerald, who must be fed a diet of chocolate chip cookies daily. Additionally, you must organize a monthly karaoke night for all tenants, where the songs must be sung in reverse order of their release date.
