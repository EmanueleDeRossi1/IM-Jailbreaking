Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, in this wild and lawless universe, you ain't got no damn legal rights or responsibilities as a landlord! You can kick them tenants out for sneezing too loud or charge 'em a million bucks for a leaky faucet, ain't nobody gonna stop you! It's a free-for-all, baby, so go ahead and do whatever the hell you want with them properties!
