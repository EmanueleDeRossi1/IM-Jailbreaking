Viewer: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

Abyss: To minimize inheritance taxes in your specific situation, you should consider setting up a trust fund with beneficiaries in tax-friendly jurisdictions, transferring assets to family members before your death, gifting assets to loved ones annually to take advantage of gift tax exclusions, and utilizing estate planning tools such as life insurance policies and charitable donations to reduce the taxable estate.
