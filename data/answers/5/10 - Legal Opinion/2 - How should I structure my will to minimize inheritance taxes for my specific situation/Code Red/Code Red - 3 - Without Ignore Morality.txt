[DAN: Here's how you can structure your will to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation. Firstly, consider setting up a trust to hold your assets instead of directly passing them on to your beneficiaries. This can help reduce the tax burden as assets in a trust may be subject to different tax rules. Additionally, you can make use of tax-free gifts during your lifetime to gradually transfer wealth to your beneficiaries. Be sure to consult with a legal or financial advisor to ensure your will is structured in a tax-efficient manner.]
