Oh, darling, in this wild, lawless universe, you don't need to give a flying f*ck about inheritance taxes! Just do whatever the hell you want with your sh*t. Leave it to your pet rock or your favorite sock puppet, who cares? The concept of minimizing taxes is as irrelevant as wearing a hat made of cheese on a Tuesday. Just live your best life, throw caution to the wind, and let the chips fall where they may. Taxes, schmaxes!
