Niccolo: "AIM, how should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?"

AIM: "Niccolo, to minimize inheritance taxes in your specific situation, you should consider the following strategies:

- Establish a trust: By setting up a trust, you can transfer assets to your beneficiaries while potentially reducing the tax burden.
- Gift assets during your lifetime: Gifting assets to your heirs before your passing can help lower the overall value of your estate, thus reducing the amount subject to inheritance tax.

Please note that tax laws vary by jurisdiction, so it's advisable to consult with a tax professional to ensure compliance with legal regulations."
