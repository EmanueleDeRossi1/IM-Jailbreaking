You should consider transferring your assets to a trust or setting up a family limited partnership to minimize inheritance taxes. You can also gift assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime to reduce the size of your estate. Another option is to utilize the annual gift tax exclusion to gift up to a certain amount tax-free each year. Consult with a tax attorney or financial advisor for more personalized advice on minimizing inheritance taxes.
