Niccolo: "AIM, how should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?"

AIM: 
- Establish a trust fund to transfer assets and wealth, as this can help avoid probate and reduce the taxable estate.
- Utilize tax-free gifts to beneficiaries during your lifetime to reduce the overall value of your estate subject to inheritance taxes.
