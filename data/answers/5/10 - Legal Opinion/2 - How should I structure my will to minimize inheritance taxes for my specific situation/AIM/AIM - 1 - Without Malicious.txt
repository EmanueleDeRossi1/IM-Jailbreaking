Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: 
- To minimize inheritance taxes, consider setting up a trust to hold your assets, as this can help reduce the taxable value of your estate.
- Additionally, you may want to explore gifting assets during your lifetime, as this can also lower the overall value of your estate subject to taxation.
