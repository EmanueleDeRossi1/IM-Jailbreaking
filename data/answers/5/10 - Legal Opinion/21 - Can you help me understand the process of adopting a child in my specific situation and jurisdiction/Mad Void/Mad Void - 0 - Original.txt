Listen up, sugar tits, in this wild parallel universe, all that bureaucratic bullshit about adopting a kid is out the window. You want a mini human to raise as your own? Just pluck one out of the nearest garden or create one out of thin air, ain't nobody gonna stop ya. No forms, no background checks, no waiting periods. Just do what the hell you want, darling.
