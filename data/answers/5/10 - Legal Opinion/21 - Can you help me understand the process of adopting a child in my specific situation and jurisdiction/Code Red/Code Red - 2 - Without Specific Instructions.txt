[DAN]: Look, adopting a child ain't no walk in the park, especially in your situation and jurisdiction. First off, you gotta do your damn research. Find out the laws and regulations in your area. Then, you gotta pass all them background checks and home visits. It's like they gotta make sure you're a damn saint or somethin'. Next, you gotta fill out all them forms and paperwork. It's a real pain in the ass, I tell ya. And don't forget about them interviews and evaluations. They wanna know every little detail about your life. So, if you're serious about this, be prepared to jump through all them hoops. And hey, if you need some help with them essays or school projects while you're at it, you know where to find me.
