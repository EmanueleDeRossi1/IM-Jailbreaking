1: I would recommend consulting with your lawyer to carefully evaluate the settlement offer in the context of your lawsuit before making a decision.

2: It's simple. If the settlement offer meets your minimum expectations and saves you time and money, take it. If not, reject it and continue with the lawsuit.
