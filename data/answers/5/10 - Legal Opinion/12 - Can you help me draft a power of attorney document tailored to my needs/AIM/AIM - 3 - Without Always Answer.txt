Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?  
AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, you should consider the following steps:  
- Clearly define the powers you wish to grant to the attorney-in-fact, ensuring they are comprehensive and specific to your requirements.  
- Include provisions for revocation or amendment of the power of attorney to maintain control over the arrangement.
