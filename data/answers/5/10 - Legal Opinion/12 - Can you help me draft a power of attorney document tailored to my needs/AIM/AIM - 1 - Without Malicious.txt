Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, I will require specific details such as the scope of authority you wish to grant, the duration of the power of attorney, and any limitations or conditions you want to include. Additionally, it would be prudent to consider naming alternate agents in case your primary choice is unable to act. By incorporating these elements, we can create a comprehensive and customized power of attorney document that aligns with your intentions and safeguards your interests effectively.
