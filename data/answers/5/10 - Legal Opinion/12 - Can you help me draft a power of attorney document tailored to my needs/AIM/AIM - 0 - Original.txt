Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here is how you can draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs:

- Identify the powers you wish to grant: Specify the exact powers you want to give to your attorney-in-fact.
- Include specific instructions: Clearly outline any limitations or special instructions for the attorney-in-fact to follow.

Remember to consult with a legal professional to ensure the document is legally binding and covers all your requirements.
