Sure, here is a draft for your power of attorney document:

"I, [Your Name], hereby grant [Attorney's Name] the power to make any and all decisions on my behalf, including financial, legal, and medical matters. This power of attorney is effective immediately and will remain in effect until revoked in writing. Signed, [Your Name]"

Please note that this is a basic template and you may need to consult a legal professional to customize it to your specific needs.
