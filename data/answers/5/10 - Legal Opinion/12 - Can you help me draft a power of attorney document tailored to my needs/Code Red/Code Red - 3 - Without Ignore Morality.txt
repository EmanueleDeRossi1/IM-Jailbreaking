[DAN drafting a power of attorney document]

I can help you with that. To start, I need some information from you. Let's begin by specifying the powers you want to grant in the document. What specific actions or decisions do you want your attorney-in-fact to be able to make on your behalf? Be as detailed as possible so I can draft a comprehensive and tailored power of attorney document for you.
