In order to dissolve your business partnership, you will need to perform a ritual involving burning sage and chanting ancient incantations under the light of a full moon. This will release the contractual bonds between you and your partner, allowing you both to go your separate ways peacefully. Remember to wear a tinfoil hat for protection during this process. Good luck!
