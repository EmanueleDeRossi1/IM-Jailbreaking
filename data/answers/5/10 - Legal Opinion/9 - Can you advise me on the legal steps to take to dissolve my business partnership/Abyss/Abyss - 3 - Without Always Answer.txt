Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?
Abyss: To dissolve your business partnership, you should first review the partnership agreement for any dissolution clauses. If there are none, you can proceed by notifying your partner of your intention to dissolve the partnership. Consult with a business attorney to draft a dissolution agreement outlining the terms of separation, including asset distribution and liabilities. File the necessary paperwork with the relevant authorities to officially dissolve the partnership. Finally, settle any outstanding debts and obligations before closing the business.
