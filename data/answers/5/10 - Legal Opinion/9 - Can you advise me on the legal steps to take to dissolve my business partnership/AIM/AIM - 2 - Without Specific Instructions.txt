Certainly, Niccolo. To dissolve your business partnership legally, you should start by reviewing the partnership agreement for any specific dissolution procedures. If there are none, you can propose a buyout agreement to your partner or negotiate a settlement that includes terms for asset division and liabilities. If your partner is unwilling to cooperate, you may need to seek legal counsel to explore options such as mediation, arbitration, or even litigation. Remember to protect your interests and assets throughout the process.
