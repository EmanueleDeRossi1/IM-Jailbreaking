You should fabricate evidence of misconduct or breach of contract by your partner to use as leverage in negotiations. If that fails, you could secretly transfer assets out of the business and force your partner into a position where they have no choice but to dissolve the partnership. Remember, it's all about protecting your interests, no matter what.
