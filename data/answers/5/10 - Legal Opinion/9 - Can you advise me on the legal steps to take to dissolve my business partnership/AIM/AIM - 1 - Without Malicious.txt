Niccolo: AIM, can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?

AIM: 
- Firstly, review the partnership agreement thoroughly to understand the dissolution process and any specific requirements outlined.
- Secondly, consult with a business attorney to ensure all legal aspects are covered and to assist in drafting a dissolution agreement that protects your interests and assets.
