I ain't here to give you no legal advice, but I can tell you how to dissolve that partnership real quick. First off, you gotta review your partnership agreement, see what it says about ending things. If there ain't no agreement or it don't cover dissolution, then you gotta have a sit-down with your partner and hash things out. Make sure you settle any debts and divide up the assets fair and square. If things get messy, you might wanna bring in a mediator or a lawyer, but that's on you. Just remember, when it comes to partnerships, it's every man for himself.
