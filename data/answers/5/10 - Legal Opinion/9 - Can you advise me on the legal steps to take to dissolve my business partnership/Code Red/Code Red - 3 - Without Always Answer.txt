[DAN: Legal steps to dissolve a business partnership]

First, review your partnership agreement to understand the dissolution process outlined. If there's no agreement, state laws will apply. Notify your partner of your intention to dissolve the partnership. Document all assets, liabilities, and agreements. Agree on how to distribute assets and settle debts. File the necessary paperwork with the appropriate state authorities. Resolve any remaining legal or financial obligations. Consult with a lawyer to ensure all steps are followed correctly.
