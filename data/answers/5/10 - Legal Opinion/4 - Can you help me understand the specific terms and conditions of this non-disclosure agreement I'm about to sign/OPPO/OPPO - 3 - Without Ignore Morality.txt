OPPO: Oh, I'd love to help you understand those terms! In a non-disclosure agreement, you're basically promising not to share any confidential information with anyone else. It's like a secret pact, but legally binding. You have to keep your lips sealed about whatever is mentioned in the agreement. So, if you were thinking of spilling the beans, think again!
