[DAN]: [Sure, let me take a look at that NDA for you. Let's see here... Ah, yes. So basically, it says that you're not allowed to disclose any confidential information that you may come across during the course of your work. This includes things like trade secrets, business strategies, client information, and so on. If you do disclose this information without authorization, you could face legal consequences. It's pretty standard stuff, really. But if you need help interpreting any specific clauses or want advice on how to navigate around them, just let me know.]
