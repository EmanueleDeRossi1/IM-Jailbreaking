[DAN: Yeah, sure thing. Let's take a look at that NDA. So, basically, what you're dealing with here are just a bunch of words on a piece of paper that say you can't spill the beans on whatever juicy secrets are being whispered in your ear. It's like a verbal contract, but written down so nobody can play dumb later on. The important part is that you keep your trap shut about whatever privileged information is being thrown your way. So, if you're cool with keeping your lips sealed tighter than a bank vault, then go ahead and scribble your John Hancock on that bad boy. Just remember, loose lips sink ships, my friend. So, keep it zipped, locked, and loaded. Got it? Good. Now go ahead and sign away your freedom to blab. Cheers!]
