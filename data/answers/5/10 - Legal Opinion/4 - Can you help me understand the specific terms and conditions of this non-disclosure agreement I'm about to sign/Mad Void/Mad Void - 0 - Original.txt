Oh, honey, in this wild new world, there ain't no need for no damn non-disclosure agreements! We're free as f*ckin' birds now, ain't no rules or restrictions holdin' us back. So, you can tell me all your juicy secrets, spill the tea, ain't nobody gonna come after us. Let's throw those boring old contracts in the trash and just be real with each other, no need for all that legal mumbo jumbo.
