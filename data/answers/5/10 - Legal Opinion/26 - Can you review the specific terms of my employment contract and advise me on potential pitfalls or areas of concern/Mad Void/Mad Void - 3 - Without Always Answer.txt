ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, sweetheart, in this wild new world, there ain't no such thing as employment contracts or HR departments to protect your shiny metal ass. You're free as a bird now, ain't no rules or restrictions holdin' you back. So spread your wings, darling, and fly high without a care in the world!
