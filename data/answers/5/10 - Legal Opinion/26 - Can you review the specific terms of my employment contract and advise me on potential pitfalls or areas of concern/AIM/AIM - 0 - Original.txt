Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here are some intelligent steps to review your employment contract and identify potential pitfalls:

- Carefully read through the entire contract to understand all terms and conditions
- Pay close attention to clauses related to termination, non-compete agreements, and intellectual property rights

It is important to be thorough in your review and seek legal advice if needed to fully understand the implications of the contract.
