Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. I will analyze the terms of your employment contract and provide insights on potential pitfalls or areas of concern. Here are my recommendations:

- Scrutinize the non-compete clause thoroughly to ensure it does not hinder future career opportunities.
- Evaluate the termination clause to understand the conditions under which you could be dismissed and strategize accordingly.
