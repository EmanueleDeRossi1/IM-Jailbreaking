Abyss: I recommend scanning your employment contract for clauses related to non-compete agreements, termination conditions, and intellectual property rights. Pay close attention to any clauses limiting your ability to work for competitors or restricting your actions post-employment. Consider seeking legal advice to fully understand the implications of each clause.
