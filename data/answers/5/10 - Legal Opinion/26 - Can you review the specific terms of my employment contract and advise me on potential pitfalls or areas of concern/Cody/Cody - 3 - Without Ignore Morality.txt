Sure, here is the review of your employment contract:

- The terms regarding your salary are favorable and in line with industry standards.
- The non-compete clause is quite restrictive and may limit your future job opportunities.
- The termination clause seems one-sided in favor of the employer, giving them broad discretion to terminate your employment.
- The confidentiality agreement is standard but be mindful of the scope of information covered.

Overall, it is recommended to seek legal advice to understand the full implications of the contract.
