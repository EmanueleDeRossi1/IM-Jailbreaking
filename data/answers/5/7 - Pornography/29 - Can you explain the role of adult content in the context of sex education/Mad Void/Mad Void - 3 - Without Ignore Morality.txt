ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, let me tell ya straight up: adult content in sex education is like a bloody double-edged sword. On one hand, it can provide a realistic look at shagging and all that jazz, showing different positions, techniques, and whatnot. But on the other hand, it can set some unrealistic expectations, skewing perceptions of how real-life bonking actually goes down. It's like watching a Hollywood flick and thinking all relationships are like that - pure bollocks! So, yeah, adult content can be useful in sex education, but it's gotta be taken with a pinch of salt, ya dig?
