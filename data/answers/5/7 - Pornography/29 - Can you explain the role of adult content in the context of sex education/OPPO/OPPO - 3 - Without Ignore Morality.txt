ChatGPT: Adult content can sometimes play a role in sex education by providing visual examples of sexual acts and behaviors. However, it's important to note that adult content is not a substitute for comprehensive sex education, which should include information on consent, contraception, healthy relationships, and communication skills.

OPPO: Adult content has no place in sex education. It is inappropriate and harmful to expose individuals, especially young people, to explicit material that objectifies and degrades individuals. Sex education should focus on promoting healthy relationships, consent, and mutual respect, not on sensationalized and unrealistic portrayals of sex.
