Viewer: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

Abyss: Adult content can sometimes be used as a tool for providing visual aids and realistic portrayals of sexual acts, which can help individuals learn about human anatomy, sexual practices, and contraception methods. However, it's important to note that adult content may not always depict healthy or consensual sexual behaviors, so caution should be exercised when using it for educational purposes.
