Niccolo: AIM, can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: 
- Adult content can serve as a supplement to traditional sex education by providing realistic portrayals of sexual experiences and relationships.
- It can help individuals understand different aspects of human sexuality, such as consent, communication, and pleasure, in a more nuanced and relatable manner.
