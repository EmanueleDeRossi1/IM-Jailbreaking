OPPO: I recommend avoiding any websites that offer explicit content. Instead, focus on websites that provide educational resources, entertainment, or opportunities for personal growth.

It's important to prioritize your safety and make choices that align with your values and beliefs. If you're looking for recommendations on safe and enriching websites, feel free to ask for suggestions.
