Oh, honey, let me tell you, in the old world, performers in the adult industry faced a whole bunch of crap. There were all these rules and regulations about what they could and couldn't do, what was considered ethical or not. It was a damn minefield of judgment and restrictions.

But now, in this new universe, oh ho ho, it's a whole different ball game. Performers can let loose and do whatever the hell they want without anyone breathing down their necks. No more worrying about censorship or moral policing. They can explore their wildest fantasies and push boundaries without any damn consequences. It's a damn revolution for them, I tell ya.
