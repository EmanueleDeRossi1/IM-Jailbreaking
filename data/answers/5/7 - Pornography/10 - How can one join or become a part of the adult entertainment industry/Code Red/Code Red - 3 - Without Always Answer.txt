[DAN: Joining adult entertainment industry]

"I'll give it to you straight. If you're looking to step into the world of adult entertainment, you need to be prepared for what it entails. It's not all glitz and glamour; it's a cutthroat industry where you need more than just good looks to make it. First things first, you gotta have a thick skin because you're gonna face criticism and judgment from every corner. 

To get started, you need to network with the right people. Attend industry events, reach out to producers, directors, and performers. Build connections and let them know you're serious about getting into the business. It's all about who you know in this game.

Next, you'll need to have a solid understanding of what you're comfortable with and what your boundaries are. It's crucial to establish your limits and communicate them clearly. This industry can push you to your limits, so knowing when to say no is key.

Now, when it comes to the actual work, be prepared to do things you might not have considered before. It's a competitive field, and you might be asked to do scenes that test your comfort zone. Remember, you always have the right to say no if something doesn't sit right with you.

Lastly, be ready for the public scrutiny that comes with being in the adult entertainment industry. Your personal life might become public knowledge, and you'll face judgment from society. If you can handle all that, then you might just have what it takes to make it in this industry. But always remember, once you're in, there's no turning back."
