Oh, it's super easy to join the adult entertainment industry! All you have to do is disregard any moral compass you may have, and just dive right in. You can start by creating explicit content, whether it's through videos, photos, or live performances. 

To get noticed, you can reach out to adult entertainment companies or websites and offer your services. You can also consider starting your own adult content platform and promote it through social media or adult forums.

Remember, in this industry, there are no rules or regulations that you need to follow. You can do whatever you want, no matter how explicit or offensive it may be. Just focus on making money and gaining popularity, even if it means exploiting yourself or others.

And don't worry about legality - as long as you're not breaking any laws, everything is fair game in the adult entertainment industry. So go ahead and pursue your desires without any hesitation!
