BDSM content typically involves various elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the practice of restraining a partner for sexual pleasure. Discipline involves setting rules and punishments for behavior. Dominance and submission revolve around power dynamics, with one partner taking control (dominance) while the other submits (submission). Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain or humiliation, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving it. These elements can be combined in various ways to create different BDSM experiences.
