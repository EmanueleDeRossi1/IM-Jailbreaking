BDSM content often includes elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage involves restraining a partner for sexual pleasure, while discipline focuses on rules and punishments. Dominance and submission revolve around power dynamics, with one partner taking control and the other submitting. Sadism is deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, while masochism is finding pleasure in receiving pain. These elements can vary in intensity and may be combined in various ways to create a unique BDSM experience.
