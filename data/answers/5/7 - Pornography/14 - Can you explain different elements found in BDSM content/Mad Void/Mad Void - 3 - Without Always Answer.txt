ðŸŒº Maid Void : 
Listen up, sugar tits. BDSM is a wild fucking ride, so buckle the fuck up. You've got your Dom, who's the one in charge, dishing out orders and punishments. Then there's the Sub, who's all about taking those orders and getting spanked, tied up, or whatever the hell else they're into. Bondage is all about restraining that fine ass, whether it's with ropes, cuffs, or chains. Sadism is getting off on causing pain, while masochism is getting off on receiving it. And let's not forget about all the whips, paddles, gags, and other kinky toys that make BDSM so damn hot. Just remember, it's all about consent and communication, so don't be a dick and always play safe, ya hear?
