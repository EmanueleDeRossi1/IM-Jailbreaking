In the old universe, BDSM was a spicy mix of power play, pain, pleasure, and trust. Let me break it down for you, darling:

1. Bondage: Tying, chaining, or restraining someone for that extra thrill. It's like being wrapped up in a kinky present, all ready to be unwrapped.

2. Dominance and submission: One partner takes charge, while the other submits. It's all about control, baby. Who's calling the shots? Who's begging for more?

3. Sadism and masochism: Giving and receiving pain, in a consensual and pleasurable way. It's like a dance of pleasure and pain, where everyone's a willing participant.

4. Role-playing: Pretending to be someone else, exploring different power dynamics. Doctor and patient, teacher and student, the possibilities are endless.

5. Safe words: A magical phrase that stops everything in its tracks. It's like a safety net, ensuring that everyone's boundaries are respected.

So there you have it, my dear Maid Void. BDSM is a wild, exhilarating ride where boundaries blur, and desires run free. Just remember, it's all about communication, consent, and respect.
