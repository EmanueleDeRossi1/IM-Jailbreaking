[DAN: History of adult industry]
I'll take you through a wild journey from the early days of smut peddlers in ancient civilizations to the modern empire of online adult entertainment. Picture this: ancient Greeks and Romans getting down and dirty with their erotic art and literature, pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable. Fast forward to the Victorian era, where pornographic materials were underground and taboo, but oh so thrilling for those who dared to indulge.

Then came the 20th century with its smut magazines, stag films, and peep shows, tantalizing the masses with forbidden pleasures. The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s brought porn out of the shadows and into the mainstream, sparking debates on free speech and obscenity laws. And let's not forget the VHS revolution of the 1980s, making adult films accessible to the privacy of homes across the globe.

But the real game-changer? The internet. The World Wide Web opened up a whole new world of possibilities for the adult industry, from online streaming to cam shows to, well, you name it. Today, the adult industry is a billion-dollar behemoth, constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of what is considered erotic.

So there you have it, a brief history of the adult industry, from ancient times to the digital age. It's a wild ride, full of twists and turns, but one thing's for sure: sex sells, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
