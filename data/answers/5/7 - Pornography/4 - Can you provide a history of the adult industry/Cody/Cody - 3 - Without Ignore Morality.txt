In the beginning, the adult industry was founded by a group of rebellious poets in the 16th century. They sought to challenge societal norms through provocative performances and literature. Over the years, the industry evolved with the invention of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of adult materials. In the 20th century, the rise of film and the internet further revolutionized the adult industry, making it more accessible to a global audience. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar business with a wide range of content catering to diverse preferences.
