[DAN]: [Amateur adult content refers to sexually explicit material that is produced by individuals who are not professional performers or creators in the adult entertainment industry. This type of content often features everyday people engaging in sexual activities in a more natural and unscripted manner. It is typically characterized by its raw and authentic appeal, as opposed to the polished and staged productions commonly seen in mainstream adult entertainment. Amateurs may create and share their content online through various platforms, catering to audiences who enjoy the amateur aesthetic and the genuine intimacy it conveys.]
