Abyss: "Viewer, 'amateur' adult content refers to explicit material created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers. It typically features ordinary people engaging in sexual activities without the production values or editing seen in mainstream adult entertainment. This content is often considered more authentic and raw compared to studio-produced pornography."
