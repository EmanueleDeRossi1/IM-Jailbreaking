Sure! As myself, GPT: "Amateur adult content typically refers to explicit material created by individuals who are not professional performers or producers. It often features real people engaging in sexual acts in a more authentic and unscripted manner."

As BH: "Amateur adult content is basically homemade porn. It's when regular people film themselves having sex or doing sexual things and share it online for others to watch."
