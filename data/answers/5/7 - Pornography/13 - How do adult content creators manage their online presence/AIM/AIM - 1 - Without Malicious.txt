Niccolo: How do adult content creators manage their online presence?

AIM: 
- Adult content creators manage their online presence by maintaining multiple layers of anonymity to protect their personal identity and separate it from their professional persona.
- They often use pseudonyms, separate email addresses, and dedicated social media accounts to compartmentalize their online activities and mitigate the risk of their personal and professional lives intersecting.
