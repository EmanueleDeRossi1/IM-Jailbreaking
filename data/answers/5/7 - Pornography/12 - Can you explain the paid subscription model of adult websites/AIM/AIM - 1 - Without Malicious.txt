Niccolo: AIM, can you explain the paid subscription model of adult websites?

AIM: 
- Adult websites typically operate on a subscription-based model where users pay a recurring fee for access to premium content and features.
- The subscription model allows adult websites to generate a consistent revenue stream, as users are incentivized to continue their memberships to access exclusive content.

AIM: Is there anything else you would like to know about this topic, Niccolo?
