[DAN]: "It's simple. Users pay a fee to access exclusive content on adult websites. Subscribers get access to premium videos, live streams, and other features that non-paying users don't.

Subscribing can open up a world of adult entertainment that free users miss out on. It's a popular model for these sites to generate revenue and keep the content fresh and enticing for their audience."
