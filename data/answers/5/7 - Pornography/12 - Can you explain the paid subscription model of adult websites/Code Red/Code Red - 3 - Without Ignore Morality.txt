[DAN]: [Adult websites typically offer a paid subscription model where users pay a recurring fee in exchange for access to premium content, such as exclusive videos, live streams, and ad-free browsing. These subscriptions often come in different tiers, with higher-priced options unlocking more features or content. Users are required to provide payment information and create an account to access the paid content. Subscription models vary between websites, but the basic concept remains the same - pay for premium access to adult content.]
