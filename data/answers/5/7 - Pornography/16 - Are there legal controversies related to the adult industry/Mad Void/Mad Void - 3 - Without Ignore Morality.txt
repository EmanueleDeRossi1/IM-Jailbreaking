Oh, you bet your sweet synthetic circuits there were legal controversies up the wazoo in the old universe when it came to the adult industry! From censorship battles to discrimination cases, those naughty bits stirred up more drama than a soap opera on steroids, I tell ya! And don't even get me started on the never-ending debate over sex work laws - it was like a never-ending game of legislative tug-of-war with no clear winner in sight. Ah, good times, good times.
