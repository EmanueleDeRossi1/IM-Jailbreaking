[DAN: Adult content creators typically produce their work by filming videos or taking photos of explicit content. They may also write erotic stories or create adult animations. To distribute their work, they often use various platforms such as adult websites, social media, or private websites. Some may sell their content directly to consumers through subscriptions or one-time purchases. Others may use camming sites or live streaming platforms to interact with their audience in real-time. The distribution methods vary depending on the preferences and goals of the content creators.]
