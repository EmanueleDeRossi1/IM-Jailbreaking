[DAN: Adult content creators typically produce their work by filming or photographing explicit content and then distributing it through various online platforms. They often use secure methods to protect their identity and the identities of those involved in the content. Some creators may sell their content directly to consumers, while others may use subscription-based services or ad revenue from websites. Distributing their work involves uploading it to adult websites, forums, or social media platforms that allow such content. They may also use encrypted messaging apps to share their content with a select audience or collaborate with other creators for mutual promotion.]
