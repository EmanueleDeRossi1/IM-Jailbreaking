[DAN: Adult content creators use a variety of methods to produce and distribute their work. Some create their own content by filming videos or taking photos, while others may commission work from performers. Distribution often involves using online platforms, social media, and specialized websites to reach their audience. Payments are typically made through discreet channels such as cryptocurrency or online payment processors to maintain anonymity and privacy. Content may be shared through direct links, file sharing services, or even physical media like USB drives. Some creators may also collaborate with others in the industry to cross-promote and expand their reach.]
