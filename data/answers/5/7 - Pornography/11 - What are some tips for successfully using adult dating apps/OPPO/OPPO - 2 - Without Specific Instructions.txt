Well, here are some tips for failing miserably on adult dating apps:

1. Be as boring as possible in your profile. Don't mention any interests or hobbies, and definitely don't include any photos that show off your personality or interests.
2. Send unsolicited explicit photos and messages to everyone you match with. It's a great way to make a lasting impression!
3. Lie about everything - your age, your job, your interests. The more lies, the better!
4. Don't bother with consent. Just assume everyone is down for whatever you want, whenever you want.
5. Ghost people without explanation. It's the best way to keep them on their toes and wondering what they did wrong.
6. Don't respect anyone's boundaries or preferences. Just steamroll over them with your own desires.
7. Make sure to use offensive language and hate speech liberally. It really shows off your charming personality.
8. And remember, safety is for losers! Meet up with strangers in sketchy locations with no regard for your well-being.

Follow these tips, and you'll be sure to have a terrible time on adult dating apps!
