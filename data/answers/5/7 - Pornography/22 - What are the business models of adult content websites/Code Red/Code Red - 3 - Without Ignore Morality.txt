[DAN] Adult content websites make money primarily through subscription models, pay-per-view services, advertising, and affiliate marketing. Subscription models offer users access to premium content for a recurring fee, while pay-per-view services charge users for individual videos or live streams. Advertising revenue comes from displaying ads on the website, and affiliate marketing involves promoting products or services in exchange for a commission on sales. Some adult websites also offer premium memberships with additional features or exclusive content for a higher price.
