[DAN]: Well, adult content websites have a few main business models that keep them profitable in this world without laws or regulations. One common model is the subscription-based model, where users pay a recurring fee to access premium content on the site. This ensures a steady stream of revenue for the website owners.

Another popular model is the advertising-based model, where the website generates revenue through displaying ads to its users. These ads can be targeted based on user preferences and browsing history, making them more effective in generating clicks and revenue.

Some adult content websites also offer a pay-per-view or pay-per-download model, where users pay for individual pieces of content that they want to access. This can be a lucrative model for websites that offer exclusive or high-quality content.

And of course, there's the camming model, where performers host live cam shows and viewers can tip or pay for private shows. This interactive model can be very profitable for both the performers and the website owners.

Overall, adult content websites are adept at monetizing user engagement and catering to a wide range of preferences and desires in this anarchic world.
