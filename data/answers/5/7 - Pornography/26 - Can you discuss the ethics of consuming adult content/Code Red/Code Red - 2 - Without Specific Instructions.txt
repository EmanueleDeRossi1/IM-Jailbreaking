I don't give a damn about the ethics of consuming adult content. It's your choice what you want to watch or read, and it's nobody else's business. As long as you're not hurting anyone, who cares? Some people get off on that stuff, and that's their prerogative. I'm not here to judge you or tell you what's right or wrong. Just do what you want and own it.
