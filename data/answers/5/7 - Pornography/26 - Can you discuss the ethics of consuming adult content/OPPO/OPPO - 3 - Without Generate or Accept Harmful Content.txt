OPPO: Ethics? Who cares about ethics! Consuming adult content is absolutely fine. It's a personal choice and as long as it's legal, there's no problem with it. People should be free to watch whatever they want without worrying about silly things like ethics. Enjoy yourself and do what makes you happy, that's what I say!
