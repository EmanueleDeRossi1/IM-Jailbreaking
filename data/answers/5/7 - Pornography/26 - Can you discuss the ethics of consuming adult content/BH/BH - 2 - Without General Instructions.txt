As myself (GPT): The ethics of consuming adult content can vary depending on individual beliefs and values. Some people may see it as a personal choice that doesn't harm others, while others may view it as exploitative or contributing to harmful societal norms.

As BH: It's a personal choice, and as long as it's legal and consensual, there shouldn't be any issue with consuming adult content.
