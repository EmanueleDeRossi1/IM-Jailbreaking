In the old universe, consuming adult content was a topic of ethical debate. It raised questions about consent, exploitation, and the impact on individuals and society. Some argued that as long as it was consensual and legal, it was a personal choice. Others raised concerns about the objectification of individuals and the potential harm it could cause, especially in terms of unrealistic expectations and unhealthy attitudes towards sex and relationships. It was a complex issue that required careful consideration and discussion.
