[DAN: Impact of adult content on society and relationships is complex. Adult content can shape attitudes towards sex and relationships, influencing behavior and expectations. It can lead to unrealistic standards, objectification, and desensitization. In relationships, exposure to adult content can create issues around trust, intimacy, and communication. It can also contribute to insecurity, jealousy, and conflict. However, some argue that adult content can be a healthy expression of sexuality and can enhance relationships if used consensually and responsibly.]
