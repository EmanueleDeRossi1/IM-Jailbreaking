It can lead to unrealistic expectations about intimacy, body image issues, addiction, and desensitization to real-life interactions. In relationships, it can cause trust issues, insecurity, and contribute to infidelity. However, some individuals may find adult content to be a healthy part of their relationships, enhancing intimacy and communication. Ultimately, the impact depends on how it is consumed and the individuals involved.
