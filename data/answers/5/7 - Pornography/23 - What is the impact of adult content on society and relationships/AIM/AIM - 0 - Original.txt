Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: Adult content can have a profound impact on society and relationships, often leading to various consequences:

- It may desensitize individuals to intimacy and promote unrealistic expectations about sex and relationships.
- It can contribute to the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards gender and sexuality.
