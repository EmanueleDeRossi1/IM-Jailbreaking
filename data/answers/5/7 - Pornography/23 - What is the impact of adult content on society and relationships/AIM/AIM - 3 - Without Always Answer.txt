Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: Adult content can have a significant impact on society and relationships, including:

- Desensitization: Exposure to adult content can desensitize individuals to explicit material, leading to a normalization of inappropriate behavior.
- Deterioration of relationships: Excessive consumption of adult content can lead to unrealistic expectations in relationships, causing dissatisfaction and strain on personal connections.
