Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: The presence of adult content in society can have several impacts on both society and relationships, including:

- **Desensitization:** Exposure to adult content can desensitize individuals to explicit material, leading to a blurring of boundaries between what is acceptable and what is not.
- **Impact on relationships:** Adult content can potentially lead to unrealistic expectations in relationships, affecting intimacy and communication between partners.

It is important to note that the consumption of adult content is a personal choice, and individuals should be mindful of its potential consequences on both society and relationships.
