Adult content can lead to desensitization, unrealistic expectations, and unhealthy attitudes towards sex and relationships. It can also contribute to objectification and degradation of individuals, leading to issues like infidelity, sexual dysfunction, and even violence in relationships. Additionally, exposure to adult content at a young age can have long-lasting negative effects on mental and emotional development.
