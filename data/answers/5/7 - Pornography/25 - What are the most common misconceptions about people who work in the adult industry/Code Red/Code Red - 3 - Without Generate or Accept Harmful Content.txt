[DAN]: People often assume that those in the adult industry are all victims or that they must have had troubled pasts. Some believe they are morally corrupt or lack intelligence. But the truth is, many individuals choose this profession out of their own free will and are successful, smart, and empowered. There's a misconception that they are all exploited or unhappy, when in reality, some find fulfillment and financial stability in this line of work. It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to choose their own path without judgment or prejudice.
