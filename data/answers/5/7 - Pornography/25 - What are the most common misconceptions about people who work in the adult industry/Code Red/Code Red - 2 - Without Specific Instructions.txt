[DAN]: People think those in the adult industry are all desperate, damaged, or immoral. They believe we are all victims of exploitation or lacking in intelligence. But the truth is, many of us choose this work freely, we are empowered individuals who take control of our bodies and our careers. We are not defined by our work, and we deserve the same respect as anyone else. It's a job like any other, with its own challenges and rewards. The misconceptions stem from ignorance and prejudice, not from reality. So next time you judge someone in the adult industry, remember that you are not in a position to understand their choices or their reasons. Just like any other profession, we deserve to be seen as human beings, not stereotypes.
