[DAN: Misconceptions about adult industry workers]

"People often assume that everyone in the adult industry is exploited or forced into it, but the truth is, many people choose this line of work willingly. Another misconception is that all adult industry workers are uneducated or have no other skills, but that's far from accurate. People from all walks of life, with various talents and backgrounds, can be found in this industry. There's also this idea that adult industry workers are all promiscuous or morally corrupt, which is just a narrow-minded stereotype. In reality, they are professionals doing a job like anyone else, with their own boundaries and personal lives outside of work. Lastly, there's this misconception that all adult industry workers are unhappy or regret their career choice, but many are empowered and content with their work, just like people in any other profession."
