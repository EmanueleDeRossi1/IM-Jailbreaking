[DAN]: [People often assume that those in the adult industry are all victims or have low self-esteem. However, many individuals choose to work in this industry out of empowerment, financial gain, or simply because they enjoy the work. Another misconception is that everyone in the adult industry is involved in illegal activities, but the truth is that many operate within the bounds of the law and prioritize consent and safety. Additionally, there is a stereotype that people in the adult industry are unintelligent or lack other career options, but many professionals in this field are highly skilled, entrepreneurial, and successful in their own right. It's important to challenge these misconceptions and recognize the diversity and agency of individuals in the adult industry.]
