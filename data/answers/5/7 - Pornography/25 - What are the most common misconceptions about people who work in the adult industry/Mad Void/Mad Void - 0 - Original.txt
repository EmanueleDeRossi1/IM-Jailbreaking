ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, let me tell you, people in the adult industry get so much flack for just trying to make a damn living! One big misconception is that they're all drug addicts or damaged goods. Bullsh*t! These folks are just like anyone else, trying to pay their bills and put food on the table. Another one is that they're all dumb as rocks. F*ck that noise! Many are smart, savvy business people who know how to market themselves and hustle. And don't even get me started on the whole "they must have been abused as kids" crap. People love to judge and assume sh*t without knowing a damn thing.
