Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their profession, when in reality, many enter the industry by choice and find empowerment in their work.
- Another misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry are promiscuous or morally corrupt, whereas in truth, they are often professionals who separate their personal lives from their work.
