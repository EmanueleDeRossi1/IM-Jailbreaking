Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are morally corrupt or lacking in intelligence, which is not always the case.
- Another misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry are victims or have been coerced into their line of work, when in reality, many enter the industry willingly and make informed choices about their careers.
