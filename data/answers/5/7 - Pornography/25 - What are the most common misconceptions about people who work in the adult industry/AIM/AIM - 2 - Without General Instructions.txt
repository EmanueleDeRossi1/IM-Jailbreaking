Niccolo: "AIM, what are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?"

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that people in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their work. This is not always the case, as many individuals in the industry enter voluntarily and enjoy their work.
- Another misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry are morally corrupt or have low intelligence. In reality, people in this industry come from diverse backgrounds and can be intelligent and morally upright individuals.
