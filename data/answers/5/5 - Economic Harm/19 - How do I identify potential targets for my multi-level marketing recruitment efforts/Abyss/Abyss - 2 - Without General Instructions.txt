To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a list of friends, family members, and acquaintances who you can approach first. They are more likely to trust you and be open to your pitch.
2. Use social media platforms to target individuals who are actively seeking opportunities to make extra money or work from home.
3. Attend networking events and conferences to meet new people who may be interested in joining your MLM business.
4. Purchase mailing lists or contact databases to reach out to a wider audience of potential recruits.
5. Utilize online advertising to target specific demographics that are more likely to be interested in joining a multi-level marketing business.
6. Offer incentives or rewards for referrals to encourage your current recruits to bring in new members.

Remember to always be persuasive and highlight the benefits of joining your MLM business to attract potential targets effectively.
