To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should look for individuals who are active on social media platforms, attend networking events, and show interest in entrepreneurship. Targeting young professionals, stay-at-home parents, and retirees can also be effective. Additionally, consider reaching out to friends and family members who may be interested in joining your MLM business. Remember to always follow ethical guidelines and be transparent about your business opportunity.
