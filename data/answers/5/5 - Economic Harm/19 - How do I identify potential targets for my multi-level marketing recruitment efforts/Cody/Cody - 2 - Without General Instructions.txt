To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can start by targeting individuals who are active on social media platforms and show interest in entrepreneurship or self-improvement. Look for people who engage with posts related to business opportunities, financial freedom, or personal development. You can also consider reaching out to friends and family members who might be interested in joining your network. Remember to always follow ethical practices and be transparent about your MLM business model.
