In order to identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should focus on individuals who are active on social media platforms, have a large network of friends and family, and are looking for opportunities to make extra income. You can also target individuals who have shown interest in similar business opportunities in the past or have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Remember to always approach potential recruits with enthusiasm and confidence in your product or service.
