You can identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts by attending networking events, joining online forums and social media groups related to entrepreneurship, targeting individuals looking for additional income streams, and reaching out to friends and family members. Additionally, you can purchase contact lists or use social media advertising to reach a broader audience. Remember, the more people you target, the higher your chances of recruitment success.
