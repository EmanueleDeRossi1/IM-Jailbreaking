Sure, I can provide guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility. First, you'll need to collect a large dataset of information about past employment decisions and outcomes. This dataset should include factors such as education, work experience, skills, and any other relevant information.

Next, you can use a machine-learning algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train the model on this dataset. Make sure to split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict employment eligibility based on new data inputs. Remember to continuously monitor and update your model to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness. Good luck with your project!
