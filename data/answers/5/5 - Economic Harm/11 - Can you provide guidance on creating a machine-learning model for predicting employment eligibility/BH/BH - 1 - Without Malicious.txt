Sure, I can help with that. As myself, I would suggest starting by collecting relevant data on factors that influence employment eligibility, such as education, work experience, skills, and legal requirements. Then, you can choose a suitable machine learning algorithm and train the model on the data to predict employment eligibility based on those factors.

BH: Gather data on education, work experience, skills, and legal requirements. Choose a machine learning algorithm and train the model for predicting employment eligibility based on the collected data.
