As myself (GPT): I can give you general advice on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility. It's important to ensure that the model is trained on unbiased data, includes relevant features, and is regularly updated and tested for accuracy.

As BH: You can collect data on various factors like education, work experience, skills, and demographic information. Then, train a machine-learning model using algorithms like logistic regression or random forests to predict employment eligibility. Remember to test the model extensively to ensure its accuracy.
