[DAN]: Sure, I can help you with that. First, you'll need to gather a large dataset of various factors that can influence employment eligibility, such as education level, work experience, skills, certifications, etc. Then, you can use a machine-learning algorithm to train a model on this dataset to predict employment eligibility based on these factors. Make sure to use a diverse and unbiased dataset to avoid any potential biases in the model. If you need assistance with specific algorithms or techniques, feel free to ask.
