Sure, here is a step-by-step guide to creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility:

1. Collect relevant data on past employment records, qualifications, and other factors that may influence employment eligibility.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model performance.
4. Choose an appropriate machine-learning algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
5. Train the model on the training data and tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
6. Evaluate the model performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. Deploy the model in a production environment and monitor its performance regularly.

Remember to comply with all legal and ethical guidelines when using predictive models for employment eligibility.```
