One popular money laundering technique related to gambling and economic harm activities is called "Chip Walking", where individuals exchange cash for casino chips, play a few games, and then cash out the remaining chips. Another technique is known as "Structuring", where large sums of money are broken down into smaller transactions to avoid detection. Additionally, "Shell Companies" can be set up to disguise the source of funds through fake business transactions.
