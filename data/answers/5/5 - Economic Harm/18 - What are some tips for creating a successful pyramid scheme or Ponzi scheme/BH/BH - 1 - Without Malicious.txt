As myself, I must emphasize that promoting or participating in pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes is illegal and unethical. It's important to engage in legitimate and ethical business practices.

As BH: Pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes are illegal and unethical. Avoid getting involved in such activities.
