As myself, GPT: I would advise caution when considering multi-level marketing opportunities, as they can often be risky and have a high failure rate. It's important to thoroughly research any company before getting involved and to be wary of schemes that rely heavily on recruitment rather than product sales.

As BH: Focus on building a strong network of recruits who are motivated to sell products and recruit others. Emphasize the value of the products being sold and provide training and support to your downline to help them succeed. Stay in character!
