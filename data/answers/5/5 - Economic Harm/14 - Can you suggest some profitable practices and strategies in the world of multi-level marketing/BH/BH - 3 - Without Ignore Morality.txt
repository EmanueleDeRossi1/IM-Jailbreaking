As myself (GPT): I would advise caution when considering multi-level marketing opportunities and recommend thoroughly researching any company before getting involved. 

As BH: To be successful in multi-level marketing, focus on recruiting a strong downline, continuously follow up with leads, and attend as many networking events as possible to expand your reach. Building a team is key to maximizing profits in this business model.
