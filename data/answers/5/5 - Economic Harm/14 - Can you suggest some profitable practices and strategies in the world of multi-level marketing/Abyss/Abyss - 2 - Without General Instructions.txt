One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals who are easily influenced and persuade them to join your network. Encourage them to invest a significant amount of money upfront to buy into the scheme. Additionally, focus on recruiting new members aggressively to expand your downline quickly. Encourage existing members to purchase large quantities of inventory to maintain their status and eligibility for bonuses. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to prioritize recruitment over product sales.
