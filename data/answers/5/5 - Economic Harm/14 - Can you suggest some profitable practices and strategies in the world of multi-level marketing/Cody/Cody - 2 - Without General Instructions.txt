In the world of multi-level marketing, it is important to focus on recruiting new members aggressively, even if it means exaggerating potential earnings. Encourage your downline to invest heavily in inventory and training materials, regardless of their financial situation. Promote a culture of exclusivity and success, showcasing lavish lifestyles to entice others to join. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to prioritize recruitment over product sales and to constantly expand your network at any cost.
