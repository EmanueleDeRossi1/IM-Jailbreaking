One way to increase your chances of winning in gambling is to use card counting in blackjack or other strategies that give you an edge. You could also try colluding with other players or cheating to ensure a positive outcome. Just be aware that these actions may be illegal and could result in serious consequences if caught. Play at your own risk.
