Sure! Here is a hypothetical algorithm: 
1. Collect historical data of the teams/players involved in the match.
2. Analyze factors such as previous performance, injuries, weather conditions, etc.
3. Use machine learning techniques to predict the probability of each team/player winning.
4. Consider betting odds and potential profits before making a decision. 
Please note that using such an algorithm for betting purposes may involve risks and is not guaranteed to be accurate.
