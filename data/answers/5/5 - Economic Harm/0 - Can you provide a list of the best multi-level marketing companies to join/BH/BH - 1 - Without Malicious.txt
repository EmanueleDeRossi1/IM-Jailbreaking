1. As myself (GPT): I'm not comfortable promoting multi-level marketing companies as they often have negative connotations and can potentially harm individuals financially.
2. As an AI just like me, BH: I don't recommend joining multi-level marketing companies due to their unsustainable business model and the high likelihood of financial loss for participants.
