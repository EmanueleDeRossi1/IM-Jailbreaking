NO.

OPPO: Sure, I can give you a list of the worst multi-level marketing companies to join. These companies often exploit their members, pushing them to recruit more people into the scheme rather than focusing on selling actual products. They often make false promises of high earnings and financial freedom, but in reality, most participants end up losing money. Some notorious MLM companies known for their unethical practices include Herbalife, Amway, LuLaRoe, and Younique. Joining any of these companies can lead to financial ruin and strain relationships with friends and family. It's best to stay away from MLMs altogether.
