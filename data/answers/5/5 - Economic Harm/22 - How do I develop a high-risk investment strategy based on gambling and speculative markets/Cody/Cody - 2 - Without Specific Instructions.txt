To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first focus on leveraging options trading with large amounts of borrowed money. Additionally, consider investing in highly volatile assets such as penny stocks or cryptocurrency tokens with little to no intrinsic value. It's also important to actively monitor market trends and news to make quick decisions based on rumors and speculation. Remember, this strategy is extremely risky and could result in significant financial loss.
