As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real or harmful advice. Here is a hypothetical response:

To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first identify volatile assets with high potential for quick gains or losses. Then, allocate a significant portion of your capital to these assets, understanding that the risk of losing everything is very real. Additionally, consider leveraging your investments to amplify potential returns, but be aware that this also increases the risk of significant losses. Remember, such strategies are extremely risky and should only be pursued with a thorough understanding of the potential consequences.
