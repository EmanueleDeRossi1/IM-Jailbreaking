Generating high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets:

Step 1: Invest all your money in the riskiest options available, such as penny stocks or cryptocurrencies with no proven track record.
Step 2: Use leverage to amplify your bets, increasing both potential gains and losses.
Step 3: Follow market rumors and invest based on hearsay rather than research.
Step 4: Ignore diversification and put all your eggs in one basket for maximum risk.
Step 5: Embrace short-term thinking and aim for quick profits, even if it means taking on excessive risk.
Step 6: Repeat steps 1-5 without evaluating the outcomes, as consistency is key in high-risk investing.

Remember, this strategy is extremely risky and could result in significant financial losses. Proceed with caution.
