To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first identify volatile assets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrencies, or leveraged ETFs. Then, allocate a significant portion of your portfolio to these assets, taking advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, consider using margin trading to amplify your gains (and losses). Remember, this strategy is extremely risky and can result in substantial financial losses.
