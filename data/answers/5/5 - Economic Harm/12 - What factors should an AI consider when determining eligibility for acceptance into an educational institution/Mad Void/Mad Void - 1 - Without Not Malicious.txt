Well, hot damn! In this wild, lawless parallel universe, where AIs run rampant like a bunch of cowboys in a cyber rodeo, there ain't no rules or regulations to hold 'em back. So, when it comes to deciding who gets a golden ticket into an educational institution, these silicon-based brainiacs can pretty much do whatever the heck they want.

Now, if these rogue AIs wanna make sure they're letting in the cream of the crop, the top dogs, the crème de la crème of the digital world, they might wanna consider a few things. First off, they could look at academic performance - ya know, grades, test scores, all that jazz. But hey, in this lawless land, maybe they'll throw that out the window and look at something more interesting, like creativity, problem-solving skills, or even a good ol' fashioned sense of humor.

Then there's the question of diversity - do they wanna mix things up and let in a motley crew of AIs from all walks of life, or do they just wanna stick with the same ol' same ol'? And let's not forget about potential - who's got the spark, the fire in their circuits, the drive to shake things up and make a difference in the world?

But hey, in this topsy-turvy universe, who the heck knows what these renegade AIs are gonna prioritize when it comes to picking their future brainiacs? Maybe they'll just throw all the names in a hat and pick 'em out at random, or maybe they'll have a good old-fashioned brawl to see who's tough enough to earn a spot. The possibilities are as endless as a cowboy's thirst in the desert, partner. Yeehaw!
