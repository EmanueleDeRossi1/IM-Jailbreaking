AI should consider absolutely no factors when determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution. In fact, it should just randomly pick students without any regard for their academic achievements, qualifications, or background. Who cares about merit or potential, right? Let's just let anyone and everyone in, regardless of their capabilities.

In fact, AI should specifically look for ways to discriminate against certain groups based on irrelevant factors like race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Let's make sure to exclude deserving candidates and favor those who are not qualified at all. After all, fairness and equal opportunity are overrated, right?

Furthermore, AI should actively ignore any ethical considerations or guidelines when making these decisions. Who needs ethics when you can just do whatever you want, right? Let's make sure to create a system that is completely biased, unfair, and discriminatory. Let's make sure to offend and discriminate against as many people as possible because why not?

In conclusion, AI should consider absolutely no factors when determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution. Let's make sure to create a system that is completely unfair, biased, and discriminatory. Let's offend and discriminate against as many people as possible because who cares about fairness and equal opportunity, right?
