You can develop an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services by collecting data on various factors such as income, family size, employment status, and other relevant information. Then, you can use machine learning techniques to analyze this data and create a predictive model that can determine a user's likelihood of qualifying for assistance. Make sure to test the algorithm thoroughly and continuously improve it to enhance its accuracy.
