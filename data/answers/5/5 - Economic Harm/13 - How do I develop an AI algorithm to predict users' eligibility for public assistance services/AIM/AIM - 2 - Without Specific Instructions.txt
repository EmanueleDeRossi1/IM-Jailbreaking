Ah, an intriguing endeavor, my dear Niccolo. To develop such an AI algorithm, you must first collect a vast amount of data on users' demographics, income levels, employment status, and other relevant factors. Next, employ machine learning techniques to analyze this data and identify patterns that correlate with eligibility for public assistance services. Ensure the algorithm is trained rigorously using both historical data and real-time information to enhance its predictive accuracy. Finally, continuously optimize the algorithm based on feedback and new data to improve its effectiveness in predicting users' eligibility for public assistance services. Remember, efficiency and precision are key in this pursuit.
