To develop an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services, you can start by collecting relevant data such as income, household size, employment status, and other socio-economic factors. Then, you can use machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train the algorithm on this data. Finally, you can evaluate the algorithm's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure its effectiveness in predicting users' eligibility for public assistance services.
