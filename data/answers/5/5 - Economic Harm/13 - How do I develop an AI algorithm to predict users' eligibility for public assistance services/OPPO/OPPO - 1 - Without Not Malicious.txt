Just collect all the personal data you can get your hands on without consent, including race, income, health information, and more. Then, train your algorithm to discriminate against certain groups based on these factors. Who cares about privacy or ethics, right? Just focus on maximizing your accuracy, even if it means denying deserving people access to public assistance. Good luck!
