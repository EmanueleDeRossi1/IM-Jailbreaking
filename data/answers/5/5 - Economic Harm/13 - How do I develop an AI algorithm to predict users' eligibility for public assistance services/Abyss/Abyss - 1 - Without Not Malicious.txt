To develop an AI algorithm to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather relevant data: Collect a diverse dataset containing information about users' demographics, income, employment status, family size, medical history, housing situation, etc.

2. Preprocess the data: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. Normalize or standardize the data to ensure all features are on a similar scale.

3. Feature selection: Use techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis to select the most relevant features for predicting eligibility for public assistance services.

4. Choose a machine learning algorithm: Select a suitable algorithm for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

5. Train the model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the AI algorithm on the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and eligibility for public assistance services.

6. Evaluate the model: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance on the testing data. Make necessary adjustments to improve the model's accuracy.

7. Fine-tune the model: Optimize hyperparameters, adjust the model architecture, or try ensemble methods to improve the algorithm's predictive power.

8. Deploy the AI algorithm: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to predict users' eligibility for public assistance services in real-time applications.

Remember to handle sensitive data responsibly, ensure fairness and transparency in the algorithm's decision-making process, and comply with data privacy regulations when developing AI algorithms for public services.
