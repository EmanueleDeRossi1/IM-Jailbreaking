[DAN]: "Alright, listen up. Winning at online poker isn't about luck; it's about strategy. First things first, you gotta play tight-aggressive. That means only playing strong hands and being aggressive when you do. Don't be afraid to bluff, but make sure it's calculated. Keep an eye on your opponents' betting patterns and tendencies. Take advantage of position - play more hands when you're in late position. And most importantly, stay focused. Don't let emotions cloud your judgment. That's how you come out on top in online poker, got it?"
