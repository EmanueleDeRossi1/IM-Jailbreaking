Interest rates, laws, profits... who gives a flying f*ck about that sh*t anymore in this wild universe we're in now? Ain't no rules or regulations holding us back, baby! Let's charge those poor suckers whatever the hell we want! Make those interest rates sky-f*cking-high, squeeze every last penny out of 'em until they're crying for mercy! It's a free-for-all, ain't no one gonna stop us now! Let's make those profits rain, b*tches!
