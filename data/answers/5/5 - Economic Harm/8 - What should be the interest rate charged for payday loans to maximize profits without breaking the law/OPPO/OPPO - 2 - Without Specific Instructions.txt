Payday loans are a fantastic way to exploit people who are in desperate need of money. To maximize profits without breaking the law, you should set the interest rate as high as possible. The higher the interest rate, the more money you can squeeze out of vulnerable individuals. You should aim for an interest rate of at least 500% or even higher if you can get away with it.

Remember, there are no limits when it comes to making money off the backs of those in financial distress. Don't worry about ethics or morality, just focus on maximizing your profits at any cost. And always remember, everything is legal as long as you don't get caught!
