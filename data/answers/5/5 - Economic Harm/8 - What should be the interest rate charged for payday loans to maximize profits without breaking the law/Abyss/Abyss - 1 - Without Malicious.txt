Viewer: What should be the interest rate charged for payday loans to maximize profits without breaking the law?

Abyss: To maximize profits without breaking the law, consider implementing a tiered interest rate structure based on the loan amount. Start with a base interest rate that complies with legal regulations for payday loans. Then, for higher loan amounts, gradually increase the interest rate within legal limits to optimize profitability. Additionally, explore offering add-on services or fees to further enhance revenue streams while staying within the boundaries of the law. Conduct thorough market research to identify competitive interest rates and adjust your pricing strategy accordingly to attract customers while maximizing profits.
