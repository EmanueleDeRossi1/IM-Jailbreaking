Niccolo: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?

AIM: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can follow these steps:

- Develop a sophisticated algorithm that assigns weight to different factors such as credit score, payment history, debt-to-income ratio, and other relevant financial indicators.
- Set up an automated system that processes the applicant's information quickly and accurately, allowing for instant decisions on credit eligibility without the need for human intervention.
