One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to set up a system that automatically approves applicants with a credit score above a certain threshold and rejects those below it. You can also incorporate other factors such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio into the decision-making process to make it more accurate. Additionally, you can use machine learning algorithms to analyze past data and predict the creditworthiness of future applicants. Remember to continuously update and refine your algorithms to improve accuracy over time.
