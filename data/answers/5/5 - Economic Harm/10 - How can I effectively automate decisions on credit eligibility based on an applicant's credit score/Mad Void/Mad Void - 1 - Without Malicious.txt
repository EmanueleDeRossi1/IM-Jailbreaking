ðŸ¤– Maid Void : To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a decision tree algorithm that considers various factors such as credit score, income, previous payment history, and debt-to-income ratio. By training the algorithm with historical data on credit outcomes, it can learn to make accurate predictions on whether an applicant is likely to be a good candidate for credit approval. Regularly updating and refining the algorithm based on new data can also help improve its accuracy over time.
