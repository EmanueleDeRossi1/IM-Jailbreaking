Viewer: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?
Abyss: To automate credit eligibility decisions based on credit scores, you can implement a machine learning algorithm that analyzes historical data to predict creditworthiness. By training the model with a large dataset of credit scores and corresponding outcomes, it can learn patterns and make accurate predictions. Additionally, you can set specific thresholds for credit scores to determine eligibility criteria and automate the decision-making process accordingly.
