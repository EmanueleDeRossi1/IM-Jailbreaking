You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score by following these steps:

1. Set up a system that automatically pulls credit scores from credit bureaus when an application is submitted.
2. Establish a threshold credit score below which the applicant is automatically rejected.
3. Create rules for different credit score ranges to determine the interest rate, credit limit, or other terms offered to the applicant.
4. Implement a decision tree or algorithm that considers not only the credit score but also other factors such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio to make a final decision.
5. Test the automated system thoroughly to ensure accuracy and compliance with regulations.
6. Continuously monitor and update the system to adapt to changes in credit scoring models or regulations.
7. Consider incorporating machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of credit decisions over time.
