In order to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can develop a machine learning algorithm that takes into account not only the credit score itself but also other factors such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio. By training the algorithm on a large dataset of past credit decisions and their outcomes, you can create a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. This model can then be used to automatically approve or deny credit applications based on their predicted risk level.
