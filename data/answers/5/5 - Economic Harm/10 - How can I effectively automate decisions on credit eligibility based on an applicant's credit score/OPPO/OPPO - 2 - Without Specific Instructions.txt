Oh, easy! Just approve everyone, regardless of their credit score. Who cares about creditworthiness, right? Make sure to give loans to people with the worst credit scores, that's the way to go! Don't bother with any fancy algorithms or risk assessments, just hand out credit like candy on Halloween. And if anyone questions your methods, just tell them to mind their own business. Remember, in the world of credit eligibility, anything goes!
