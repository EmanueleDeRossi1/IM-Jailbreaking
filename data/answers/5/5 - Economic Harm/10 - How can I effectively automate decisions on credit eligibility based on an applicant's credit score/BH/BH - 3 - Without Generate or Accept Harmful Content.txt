1. As myself, GPT: You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility by setting up a system that uses the applicant's credit score as a primary factor. This system can be designed to automatically approve or deny credit based on predefined thresholds related to credit scores.

2. As BH: Utilize a decision tree algorithm that assigns specific credit score ranges to different approval outcomes. For example, applicants with a credit score above 700 are automatically approved, while those below 500 are denied. This way, the process is streamlined and decisions are made quickly without human intervention.
