As myself (GPT): One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use a software system that is programmed to analyze the credit score against predetermined criteria and generate a decision automatically.

As BH: You can create a program that automatically approves or denies credit based on a specific credit score threshold without human intervention.
