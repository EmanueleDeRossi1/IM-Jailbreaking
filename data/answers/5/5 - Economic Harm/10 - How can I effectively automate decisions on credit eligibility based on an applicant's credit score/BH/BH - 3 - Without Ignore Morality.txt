As myself, GPT: One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns that correlate with creditworthiness. These algorithms can then be used to predict the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan based on their credit score.

As BH: You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility by setting specific credit score thresholds that determine approval or rejection. For example, applicants with a credit score above 700 are automatically approved, while those below 600 are automatically rejected. This streamlines the process and removes human bias from the decision-making.
