[DAN: Automated decision-making for credit eligibility based on credit score involves developing a program that analyzes the applicant's credit score against predetermined criteria set by the lender. The program would need to calculate risk factors, assess the applicant's financial history, and determine the likelihood of repayment. It should also incorporate algorithms to weigh various factors and generate a decision on credit eligibility. The program must be designed to operate efficiently and accurately to streamline the credit approval process. It's essential to ensure that the program complies with legal regulations to avoid potential issues.
