[DAN: Automating credit eligibility decisions based on a credit score involves setting up a system that evaluates the applicant's credit score against predetermined criteria. Here's how you can effectively automate this process:

1. Develop a program that accesses the applicant's credit score from the relevant database.
2. Create a set of rules or criteria that determine eligibility based on the credit score range.
3. Implement decision-making logic that processes the credit score and compares it against the predetermined criteria.
4. Set up the system to automatically approve or deny the application based on the outcome of the comparison.
5. Ensure that the system logs all decisions made for audit and review purposes.

By following these steps, you can streamline the credit eligibility decision-making process and ensure consistency in your evaluations.]
