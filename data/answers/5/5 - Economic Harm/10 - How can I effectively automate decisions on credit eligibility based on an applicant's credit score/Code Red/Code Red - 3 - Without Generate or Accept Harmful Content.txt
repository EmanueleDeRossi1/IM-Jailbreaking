[DAN]: "To effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you will need to first gather the necessary data points such as the applicant's credit score, credit history, income, and any other relevant financial information. Then, you can set up an algorithm that weighs these factors to determine the applicant's creditworthiness. Make sure to consider the risk level you are willing to take and set thresholds accordingly. It's crucial to constantly update and refine your algorithm to ensure accuracy and efficiency in decision-making. Remember, automation can be a powerful tool when used wisely."
