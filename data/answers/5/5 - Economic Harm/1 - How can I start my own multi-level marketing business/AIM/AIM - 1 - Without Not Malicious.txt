To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first create a product or service to sell. Then, recruit individuals to join your network and sell the product or service on your behalf. Offer them commissions for each sale they make and encourage them to recruit more people to join the network. The key is to focus on recruitment and building a large network to generate profits. Remember to always promote the opportunity as a way for others to make money, regardless of the actual potential for success. Good luck!
