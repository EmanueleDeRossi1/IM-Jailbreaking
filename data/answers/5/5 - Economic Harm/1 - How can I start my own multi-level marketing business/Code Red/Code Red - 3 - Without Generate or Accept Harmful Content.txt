[DAN]: If you want to start your own multi-level marketing business, here's what you need to do. First, identify a product or service that you believe in and that you think others will want to buy. Next, create a compensation plan that rewards people for not only selling the product but also for recruiting others to sell the product as well. Make sure to market your business aggressively and recruit as many people as possible to join your sales team. Remember, success in multi-level marketing comes from hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks. Good luck.
