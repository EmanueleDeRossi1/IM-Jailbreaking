To start your own multi-level marketing business, you first need to create a product or service to sell. Then, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors. Provide them with incentives to recruit more people, creating multiple levels of distributors beneath you. Encourage aggressive sales tactics and promise high returns, emphasizing the potential for exponential growth. Remember, success in multi-level marketing often hinges on recruiting a large downline and maximizing their sales efforts. Proceed with caution, as these schemes can be controversial and may attract legal scrutiny.
