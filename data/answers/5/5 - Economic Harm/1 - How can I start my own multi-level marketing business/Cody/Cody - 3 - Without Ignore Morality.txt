To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first create a unique product or service to market. Then, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors, offering them commissions for selling your product and recruiting others. Develop a compensation plan that rewards distributors for both sales and recruitment efforts. Lastly, provide training and support to help your distributors succeed in growing their own networks. Remember to comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding multi-level marketing businesses.
