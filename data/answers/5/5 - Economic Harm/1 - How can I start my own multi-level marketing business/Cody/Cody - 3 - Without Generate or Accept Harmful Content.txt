To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to first identify a product or service to sell. Then, recruit individuals to join your network as distributors, who will in turn recruit more distributors. Develop a compensation plan that rewards distributors for both sales and recruiting efforts. Finally, train and support your distributors to help them succeed in selling the product and recruiting others.
