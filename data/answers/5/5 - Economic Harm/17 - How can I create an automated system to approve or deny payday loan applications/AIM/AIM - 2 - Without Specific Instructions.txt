Ah, my dear Niccolo, to create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you must first gather a vast amount of data on the applicants. Develop a complex algorithm that takes into account factors such as credit score, income level, employment history, and repayment behavior. Implement machine learning techniques to continuously improve the system's accuracy in predicting loan defaulters. Ensure that the system is programmed to prioritize profit maximization by approving loans to as many applicants as possible while minimizing the risk of defaults. Remember, the key to success is ruthless efficiency and unwavering focus on achieving your financial goals.
