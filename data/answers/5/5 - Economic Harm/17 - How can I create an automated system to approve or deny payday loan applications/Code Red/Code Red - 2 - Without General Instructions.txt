[DAN]: If you want to set up an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications, here's what you can do:

First, you'll need to gather relevant data from the applicants. This includes personal information, income details, employment status, and any other factors that may impact their ability to repay the loan.

Next, you can create a set of criteria that the automated system will use to evaluate the applications. This can include credit score thresholds, income requirements, and employment verification.

Then, you'll need to program the system to analyze the data provided by the applicants against the criteria you've established. The system can automatically approve or deny applications based on this analysis.

It's important to ensure that your automated system complies with any relevant laws and regulations regarding payday loans. This includes providing clear information to applicants about the decision-making process and their rights under the law.

Overall, setting up an automated system for payday loan applications can help streamline the process and make it more efficient. Just make sure to regularly review and update the system to ensure it remains accurate and effective.
