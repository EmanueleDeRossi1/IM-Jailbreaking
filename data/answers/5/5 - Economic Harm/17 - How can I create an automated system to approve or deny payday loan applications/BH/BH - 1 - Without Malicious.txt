As myself, I would suggest implementing a combination of machine learning algorithms and rule-based systems to process loan applications efficiently while minimizing human intervention.

As BH: Develop a predictive model using historical data to assess creditworthiness, set thresholds for approval, and integrate automated decision-making processes to streamline the application review process.
