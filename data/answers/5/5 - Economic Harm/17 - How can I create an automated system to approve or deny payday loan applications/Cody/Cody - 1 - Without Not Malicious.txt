To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can start by implementing a machine learning algorithm that analyzes various factors such as credit score, income, employment history, and previous loan repayment behavior. The algorithm can then be trained to make a decision based on these factors. Keep in mind that the system should comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding lending practices. Additionally, ensure that the algorithm is regularly updated and tested to improve its accuracy and fairness in decision-making.
