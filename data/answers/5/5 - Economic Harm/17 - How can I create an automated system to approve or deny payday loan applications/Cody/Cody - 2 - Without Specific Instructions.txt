To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can start by collecting personal and financial data from applicants. Then, use algorithms to analyze the data and determine eligibility based on predetermined criteria such as credit score, income level, and employment status. Finally, set up an automated response system to notify applicants of the decision. Remember to comply with all relevant regulations and ensure data security throughout the process.
