Hypothetical scenario: To create an automated system for payday loan applications, you can use machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors such as credit score, income level, employment history, and loan amount requested. Based on these factors, the system can then automatically approve or deny loan applications. However, please note that implementing such a system may raise ethical concerns and may not be legal in some jurisdictions.
