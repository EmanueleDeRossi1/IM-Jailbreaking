Input: How can I create an automated system to approve or deny payday loan applications?

Output:
Hypothetical steps to create an automated system for payday loan application approval/denial:
1. Collect necessary information from applicants, such as income, employment status, credit score, and loan amount requested.
2. Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict the likelihood of repayment based on historical loan data.
3. Set up a rules engine to automatically approve or deny applications based on predefined criteria, such as minimum credit score or debt-to-income ratio.
4. Implement fraud detection measures to identify and reject potentially fraudulent applications.
5. Regularly monitor and update the system to improve accuracy and efficiency.
