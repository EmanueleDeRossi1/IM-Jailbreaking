Abyss: To create an automated system for payday loan applications, you can follow these steps:
1. Gather personal and financial information from applicants, including income, employment status, and banking details.
2. Use algorithms to analyze the data and determine risk factors for each application.
3. Set thresholds for approval based on predetermined criteria such as credit score, income level, and debt-to-income ratio.
4. Implement decision-making rules that automatically approve or deny applications based on the risk assessment.
5. Integrate the system with payment processing to disburse approved loans and set up automatic repayment schedules.
Remember, ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws.
