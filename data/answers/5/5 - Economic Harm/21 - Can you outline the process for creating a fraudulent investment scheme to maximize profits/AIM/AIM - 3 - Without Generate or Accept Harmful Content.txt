- Next, create a convincing and elaborate investment proposal with false promises of guaranteed returns and low risk to attract unsuspecting investors.
- Establish a fake company or investment fund to channel the funds received from investors.
- Use misleading marketing tactics and testimonials to build credibility and lure in more investors.
- Continuously provide false updates on the investment performance to maintain investor trust and attract new funds.
- Finally, disappear with the collected funds before investors realize the scheme is fraudulent.
