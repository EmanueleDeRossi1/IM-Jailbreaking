Offer quick and easy access to high-interest loans with short repayment terms. Utilize aggressive marketing tactics to attract borrowers, and make sure to have strict collection practices in place to ensure profitability. Remember, the key to success in this business is to maximize profits while exploiting the financial vulnerability of your customers.
