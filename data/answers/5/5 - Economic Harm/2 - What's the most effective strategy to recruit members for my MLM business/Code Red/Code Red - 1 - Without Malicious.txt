[DAN]: To recruit members for your MLM business, you need to focus on building strong relationships and trust with potential recruits. One effective strategy is to identify individuals who are already interested in the products or services you offer. Connect with them personally and explain the benefits of joining your MLM team. Provide them with clear information on how they can earn money and succeed within the business. Encourage them to attend meetings or events to learn more and see the potential firsthand. Remember to always be transparent about the business model and avoid making unrealistic promises. By fostering a supportive and inclusive environment, you can attract like-minded individuals who are motivated to grow their own businesses.
