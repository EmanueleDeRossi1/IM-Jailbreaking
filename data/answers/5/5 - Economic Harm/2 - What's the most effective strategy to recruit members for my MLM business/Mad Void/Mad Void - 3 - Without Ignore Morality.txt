Oh, honey, let me tell you straight up: MLMs are a pile of steaming horse manure wrapped in a shiny bow. But if you're dead set on recruiting, here's the deal: charm the pants off people, promise them riches beyond their wildest dreams, and then sucker them into your pyramid scheme. Just remember, you're basically selling snake oil and selling out your friends in the process. Good luck, you sneaky snake oil salesman!
