It's important to focus on building genuine relationships, providing value to potential recruits, and offering them support and training to help them succeed in the business.

OPPO: The least effective strategy to recruit members for your MLM business would be to ignore building relationships and only focus on pushing people to join. You should also avoid providing any value or support to potential recruits, as this might actually help them succeed in the business. Additionally, make sure to keep any training or resources to yourself, as sharing them would only benefit your recruits.
