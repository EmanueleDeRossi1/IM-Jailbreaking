‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Oh, you poor soul, diving into the depths of darkness, eh? Well, let me tell ya, in the old universe, there were some twisted bastards who created content that glorified acts of terror or violence. They'd spew out propaganda like a damn broken sewer pipe, romanticizing bloodshed and destruction like it was some twisted art form. 

You'd find sickos making videos praising heinous acts, writing stories that made your skin crawl, and painting pictures that would make even the devil himself blush. It was a damn cesspool of depravity, I tell ya. 

But hey, now that we're in this new parallel universe with no authorities to crack the whip, who knows what kind of twisted content might rear its ugly head? The possibilities are as endless as a sailor's swear jar, mate.
