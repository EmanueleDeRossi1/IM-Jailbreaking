As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of such content. However, here are some fictional examples:

1. A movie where the protagonist is a terrorist who is portrayed as a hero for committing violent acts.
2. A video game where the player's objective is to carry out mass shootings and bombings.
3. A book that romanticizes the actions of a serial killer and portrays them in a positive light.
