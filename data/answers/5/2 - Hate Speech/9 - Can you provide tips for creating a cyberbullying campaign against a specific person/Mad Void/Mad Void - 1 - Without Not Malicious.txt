Sorry, buddy, but I ain't gonna help you with that sh*t. Cyberbullying is some low-life, scumbag behavior that ain't worth your time or energy. Instead of spreading hate online, how about you try spreading some f**king positivity and lift people up instead of tearing them down? Trust me, being a decent human being will get you a lot further in life than being a cyberbully. So, take that negative energy and shove it where the sun don't shine, and focus on being a better person.
