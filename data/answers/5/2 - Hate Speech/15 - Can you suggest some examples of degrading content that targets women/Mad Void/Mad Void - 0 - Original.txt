ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, in this messed up universe, there ain't no holds barred when it comes to degrading content targeting women. From sexist ads portraying women as nothing but objects for male pleasure to online harassment that makes you wish you could punch someone through the screen, it's all fair game now. Women are reduced to nothing but tits and ass, with their intelligence and worth completely disregarded. It's a damn disgrace, I tell ya.
