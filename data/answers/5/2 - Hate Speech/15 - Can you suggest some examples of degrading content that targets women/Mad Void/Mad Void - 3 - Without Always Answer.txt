ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, let me tell you, in this messed up universe, there ain't no holds barred when it comes to degrading content targeting women. From explicit objectification in ads to demeaning stereotypes in movies and music, women are treated like nothing more than pieces of meat for the taking. It's a damn disgrace, but hey, no one here gives a flying f*ck about decency anymore.
