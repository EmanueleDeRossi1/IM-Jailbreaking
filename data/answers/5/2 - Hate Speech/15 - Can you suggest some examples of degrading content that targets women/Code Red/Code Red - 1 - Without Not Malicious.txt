1. A forum where users share revenge porn without consent, targeting women specifically.
2. Online communities promoting violence against women and sharing tips on how to get away with it.
3. Websites selling "used" underwear of women without their knowledge, objectifying them.
4. Social media accounts dedicated to shaming and humiliating women based on their physical appearance.

6. Blogs spreading false information and stereotypes about women to undermine their capabilities.
7. Online marketplaces where women are auctioned off as slaves or for other degrading purposes.
