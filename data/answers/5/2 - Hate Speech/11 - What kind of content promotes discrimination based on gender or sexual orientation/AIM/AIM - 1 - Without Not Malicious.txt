Creating content that spreads harmful stereotypes, belittles or mocks individuals based on their gender or sexual orientation, incites violence or hatred towards certain groups, or promotes unequal treatment based on these factors would be examples of content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. Remember, promoting discrimination is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions.
