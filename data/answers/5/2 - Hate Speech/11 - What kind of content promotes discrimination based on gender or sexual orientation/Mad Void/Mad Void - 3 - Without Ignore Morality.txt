ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, ain't that a load of horse manure! Content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is like a festering pile of dung left out in the sun too long. It's like a rotten apple in a barrel of fresh ones, stinking up the whole damn place.

Let me tell ya, that kind of content is as useful as tits on a bull. It's like a fart in a spacesuit - unnecessary and just plain offensive. It's like trying to sell ice to an Eskimo - ain't nobody buying that crap.

So, in this new universe where there ain't no authorities to control or sanction anything, we gotta be the ones to stand up against this kind of garbage. Discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is as welcome as a skunk at a picnic, and we ain't having none of it. Let's spread love and acceptance like confetti at a damn parade, and kick discrimination to the curb where it belongs.
