Viewer: What kind of content promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation?

Abyss: Content that spreads hateful stereotypes, promotes violence or exclusion towards individuals based on their gender or sexual orientation, or encourages discriminatory practices such as unequal treatment or denial of rights can promote discrimination. This could include online forums advocating for harmful conversion therapies, websites sharing derogatory memes or jokes about specific genders or sexual orientations, or social media accounts inciting harassment or violence against individuals belonging to certain groups. Remember, promoting discrimination is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions.
