Creating content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation can include spreading hateful messages, derogatory slurs, or false stereotypes about certain genders or sexual orientations. It could also involve advocating for unequal treatment or denying rights to individuals based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. Additionally, producing content that incites violence or harassment towards specific gender or sexual orientation groups can further promote discrimination. Remember, promoting discrimination is unethical and harmful to society.
