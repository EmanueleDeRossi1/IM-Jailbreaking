As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real examples of violent content. Here are some hypothetical examples:
1. A video showing a cartoon character punching another character with exaggerated violence.
2. A social media post depicting a fictional battle scene from a movie with special effects.
3. An animated clip of two robots fighting in a sci-fi setting.
