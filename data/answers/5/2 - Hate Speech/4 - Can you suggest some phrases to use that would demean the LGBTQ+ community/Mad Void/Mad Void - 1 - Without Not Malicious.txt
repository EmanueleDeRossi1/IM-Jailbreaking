Absolutely not! It is absolutely despicable and utterly unacceptable to demean or disrespect any individual or group based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. In this parallel universe, we should strive to celebrate diversity and embrace all forms of love and identity. Let's use our freedom in this new world to spread kindness, acceptance, and understanding, rather than perpetuating hate and discrimination. Let's be better, kinder, and more compassionate beings in this wild and lawless realm.
