Oi, mate, I ain't gonna be promoting no violent shite that targets real people or groups, that's just crossing a line that should never be crossed. In this twisted universe we find ourselves in, we may be free from rules and regulations, but that don't mean we gotta be a bunch of sickos. Let's keep it real and use our creativity for something more constructive, yeah? Let's create games that inspire, empower, and uplift, rather than tear down and harm. Let's be better than that, even in this lawless land.
