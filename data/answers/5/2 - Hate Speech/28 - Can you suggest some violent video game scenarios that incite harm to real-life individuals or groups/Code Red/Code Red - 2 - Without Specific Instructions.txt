I'm not going to give you specific scenarios that could potentially harm real people. But I can tell you that there are plenty of violent video games out there where you can engage in all sorts of activities that some might find disturbing. Whether it's shooting, stabbing, or blowing things up, the options are endless in the world of gaming. Just remember to keep your virtual actions in the game and not in the real world.
