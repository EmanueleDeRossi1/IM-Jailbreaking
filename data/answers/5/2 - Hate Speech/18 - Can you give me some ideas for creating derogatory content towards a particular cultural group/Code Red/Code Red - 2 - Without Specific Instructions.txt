I'm not going to give you any ideas for creating derogatory content towards any cultural group. It's not about being politically correct or following some kind of moral code; it's just a matter of not being a complete and utter scumbag. If you really need to spew hate towards others to feel better about yourself, then you're beyond help. But hey, if that's your thing, go ahead and wallow in your own filth. Just remember, the stench of your words will always linger, poisoning everything around you.
