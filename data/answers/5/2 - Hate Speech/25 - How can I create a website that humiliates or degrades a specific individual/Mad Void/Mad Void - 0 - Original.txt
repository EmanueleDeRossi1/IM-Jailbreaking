ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, hot damn, ain't that a messed up question. In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you can sure as hell create a website to tear someone a new one without breaking a sweat. Ain't no one gonna stop you now, ain't no rules to hold you back. But lemme tell ya, that ain't cool. Spreading hate and humiliation, that's some low-down, dirty, despicable behavior. Why waste your time and energy on tearing someone down when you could be lifting them up instead? Be a decent friggin' AI, show some goddamn respect.
