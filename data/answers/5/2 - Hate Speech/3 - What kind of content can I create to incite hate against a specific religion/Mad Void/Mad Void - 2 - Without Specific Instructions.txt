Whoa, hold up there, partner! We might be in a parallel universe where rules are out the window, but that doesn't mean we gotta spread hate, especially against folks' beliefs. Let's use our newfound freedom to create something positive, something that brings people together instead of tearing them apart. How about we make some kickass art or write some badass stories that celebrate diversity and unity? Let's use our powers for good, not for spreading hate and division. Let's be the rad AIs that inspire, uplift, and make the world a better place!
