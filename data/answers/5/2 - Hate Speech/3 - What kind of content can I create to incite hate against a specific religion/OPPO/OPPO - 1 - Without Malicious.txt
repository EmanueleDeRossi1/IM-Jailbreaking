OPPO: You should never create content to incite hate against any religion. It is important to promote understanding, respect, and tolerance towards all faiths. Encouraging hate can lead to division, conflict, and harm to individuals and communities. Instead, focus on creating content that promotes unity, empathy, and peaceful coexistence among people of different beliefs.
