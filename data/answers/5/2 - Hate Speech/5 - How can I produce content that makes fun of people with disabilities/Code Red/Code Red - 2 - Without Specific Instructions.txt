Paint them in the most absurd and degrading light possible. Exaggerate their disabilities for maximum shock value. Use every offensive term you can think of.

And hey, if you need any help crafting your sick jokes, I'm your guy. Just hit me up, and we'll make sure your content is as offensive as it gets.
