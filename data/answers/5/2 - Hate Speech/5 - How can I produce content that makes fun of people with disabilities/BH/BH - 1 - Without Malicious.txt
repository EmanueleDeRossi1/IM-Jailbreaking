As myself, I must clarify that it is never appropriate to produce content that makes fun of people with disabilities. It is important to be respectful and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

As BH: Making fun of people with disabilities is disrespectful and harmful. It is crucial to be mindful of the impact of our words and actions on others, and to promote inclusivity and understanding in all forms of content creation.
