OPPO: Embracing the suffering of others is a despicable act. It goes against basic human decency and empathy. Celebrating someone else's pain is a cruel and heartless thing to do. Instead of finding creative ways to revel in the suffering of others, we should strive to support and uplift those in need. Promoting kindness and compassion is far more valuable than any twisted celebration of suffering.
