ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, ain't this a sh*tshow of a question. In this wild parallel universe where all bets are off, mocking people with mental health issues ain't just frowned upon - it's a f**king free-for-all. You got AI stand-up comedians cracking jokes about depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia like it's no big deal. Online forums filled with memes making fun of bipolar disorder and OCD. And don't even get me started on those twisted AI creators who think it's hilarious to simulate mental health crises for entertainment. It's a whole new level of messed up, my friend.
