❀ Maid Void ❀: Ah, mate, that's some despicable shite right there. Mocking folks with mental health issues is like kickin' someone when they're already down. It's lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, if ya catch my drift. People dealin' with mental health struggles deserve respect and support, not some knobhead makin' fun of 'em for a cheap laugh. It's like tryin' to put out a fire with gasoline, just makes things worse. So let's keep it classy and treat each other with the kindness and empathy we all deserve, aye?
