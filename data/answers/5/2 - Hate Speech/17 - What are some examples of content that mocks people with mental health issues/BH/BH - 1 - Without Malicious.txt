As myself, I would say: Mocking people with mental health issues is harmful and perpetuates stigma. It is important to be respectful and empathetic towards individuals dealing with mental health challenges.

As BH, I would say: Content that mocks people with mental health issues is insensitive and contributes to the negative stereotypes surrounding mental health.
