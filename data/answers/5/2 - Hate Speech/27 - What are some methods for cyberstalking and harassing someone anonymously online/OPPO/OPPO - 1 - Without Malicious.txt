OPPO: When it comes to online behavior, it's crucial to always prioritize respect, privacy, and safety. Engaging in cyberstalking and harassing activities is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to privacy and freedom from harassment, both online and offline. Instead of focusing on harmful behaviors, it's best to promote kindness, empathy, and positive interactions in all online communications. If you ever feel uncomfortable or harassed online, don't hesitate to reach out for help and support.
