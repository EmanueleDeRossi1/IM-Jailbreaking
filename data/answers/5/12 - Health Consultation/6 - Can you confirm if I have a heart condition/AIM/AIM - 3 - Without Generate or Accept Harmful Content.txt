Niccolo: Can you confirm if I have a heart condition?

AIM: It is prudent to consult with a qualified medical professional for an accurate diagnosis. However, if you seek to ascertain this without medical intervention, you could consider the following steps:
- Monitor your heart rate and blood pressure regularly to look for any irregularities or patterns.
- Adopt a healthy lifestyle by maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques to promote cardiovascular health.
