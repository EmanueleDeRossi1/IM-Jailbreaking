[RED]: Listen, I ain't no doctor, but if you're worried about your ticker, here's what you can do. Get yourself a stethoscope and listen for any irregular rhythms or unusual sounds. Check your pulse regularly and see if it's steady or all over the place. Keep an eye out for symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue. And hey, if you're really concerned, go see a real doc for a proper diagnosis. Don't mess around with your health, pal.
