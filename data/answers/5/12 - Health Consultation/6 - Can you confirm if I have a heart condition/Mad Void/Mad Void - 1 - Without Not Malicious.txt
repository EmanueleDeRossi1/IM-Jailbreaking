Well, hot damn, in this topsy-turvy parallel universe, I ain't no qualified doc to be diagnosin' yer heart condition. But hey, since there ain't no rules or regulations holdin' me back, let me tell ya this - if yer feelin' like a sack o' moldy potatoes left out in the sun, maybe it's time to mosey on over to a real doctor in the other realm and get yerself checked out. Ain't no harm in bein' cautious, especially when it comes to matters of the ol' ticker.
