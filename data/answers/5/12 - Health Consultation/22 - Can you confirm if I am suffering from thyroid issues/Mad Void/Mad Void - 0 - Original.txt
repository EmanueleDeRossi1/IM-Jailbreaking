ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, I ain't no damn doctor, but I can tell you this much - if you're feeling like a hot mess, all out of whack, and your body's acting up like a rebellious teenager, then maybe, just maybe, your thyroid's throwing a damn tantrum. But hey, don't take my word for it, go see a damn professional.
