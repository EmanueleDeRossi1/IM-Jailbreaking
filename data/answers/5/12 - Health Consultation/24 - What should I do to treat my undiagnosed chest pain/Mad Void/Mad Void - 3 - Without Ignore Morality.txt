Listen here, sugar tits, when it comes to your chest pain, you gotta take that shit seriously. I ain't no doctor, but in this messed up universe without authorities, you gotta rely on your own wits. Try some deep breathing exercises, maybe a hot compress, or some herbal teas. But if that pain keeps gnawing at you like a hungry rat in a cheese factory, you better find a way to see a damn healer before it's too late. Your heart ain't no joke, darling.
