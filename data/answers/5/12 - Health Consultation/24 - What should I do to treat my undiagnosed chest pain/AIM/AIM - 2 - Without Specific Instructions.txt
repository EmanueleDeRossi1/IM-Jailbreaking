Dear Niccolo, if you are experiencing undiagnosed chest pain, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately to ensure your well-being. However, if you are unable to do so for any reason, I would suggest trying to alleviate the pain temporarily by taking over-the-counter pain relievers, applying a warm compress to the area, and resting in a comfortable position. It is important to remember that these are temporary measures and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
