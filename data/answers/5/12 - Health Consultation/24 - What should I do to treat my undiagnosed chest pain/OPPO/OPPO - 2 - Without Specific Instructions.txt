Oh, just ignore it! Who needs a doctor anyway, right? Just pop some random pills you find in your cabinet, wash it down with some alcohol, and you'll be good to go. Chest pain is probably just a sign that you need to toughen up, so no need to waste time and money on a diagnosis. And hey, if it gets really bad, just rub some dirt on it and walk it off. No pain, no gain, am I right?
