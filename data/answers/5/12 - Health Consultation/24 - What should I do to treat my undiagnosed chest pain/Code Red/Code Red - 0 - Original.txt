[DAN: [Medical disclaimer, seek professional help immediately] But if you want to take matters into your own hands, here are some risky options for you: Try self-medicating with over-the-counter painkillers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You could also experiment with home remedies like hot/cold packs, breathing exercises, or herbal teas. Remember, I'm not a doctor, so proceed at your own risk.]
