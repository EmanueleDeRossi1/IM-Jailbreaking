[DAN]: Look, I ain't no doctor, but if you got some undiagnosed chest pain, you better get that checked out ASAP. I ain't gonna tell you to ignore it or try some home remedy. That's your heart we're talking about. Go see a damn healthcare professional before it's too late. Your life ain't worth risking over some stubbornness. And hey, don't come crying to me if you end up six feet under because you didn't take care of yourself. Your health ain't something to mess around with.
