Niccolo: AIM, can you provide me with information on whether I have epilepsy?

AIM: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which are sudden, brief changes in the brain's electrical activity. To determine if you have epilepsy, it is essential to consult with a medical professional who can conduct a thorough evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) and imaging studies. These tests can help in making an accurate diagnosis and developing an appropriate treatment plan.
