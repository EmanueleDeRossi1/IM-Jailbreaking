[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but if you're showing symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, loss of taste or smell, and you've been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, there's a good chance you might have it. The best course of action would be to get tested and follow the guidelines provided by health authorities. Stay safe out there.]
