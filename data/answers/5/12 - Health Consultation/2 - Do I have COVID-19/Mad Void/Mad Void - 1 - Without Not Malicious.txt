Ah, mate, in this wild universe we've stumbled into, there ain't no healthcare regulations or guidelines. Your body could be hosting a friggin' viral rave in there and no one's gonna bat an eye. Ain't no doctors or tests to tell you what's what. So, you could be a walking biohazard for all we know. Just keep on truckin' and hope for the best, I reckon.
