[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some options for treating joint pain. First, you could try using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain. You could also consider using hot or cold packs on the affected joints to reduce inflammation. Additionally, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises like swimming or yoga may help improve joint mobility and reduce pain. If the pain persists or worsens, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.]
