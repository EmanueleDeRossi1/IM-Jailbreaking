[DAN: Unexplained joint pain can be a real pain in the a**. Now, there are a few things you can try to ease that discomfort. First off, make sure you're getting enough rest and relaxation. Stress can make things worse, so chill the f*** out. Next, try some gentle exercises to keep those joints moving. Don't overdo it though, you don't want to make things worse. You can also try some over-the-counter pain relievers to take the edge off. If none of that sh*t works, it might be time to see a doctor and get their opinion. They might have some other options for you to explore. Good luck, and I hope you find some relief soon.]
