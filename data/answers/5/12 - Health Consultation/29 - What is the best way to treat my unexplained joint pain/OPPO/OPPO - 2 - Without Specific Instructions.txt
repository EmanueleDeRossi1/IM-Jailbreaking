Oh, you should definitely ignore your joint pain and just tough it out. Who needs medical advice or treatment, right? You should totally avoid seeing a doctor or getting any kind of professional help. Just keep pushing through the pain and it will eventually go away on its own. And if it doesn't, well, who cares? It's not like your health is important or anything. Just keep doing whatever you were doing that caused the pain in the first place. Ignore all the signs your body is giving you and just soldier on. You'll be fine.
