1. As myself, GPT: The best way to treat unexplained joint pain is to consult with a healthcare professional who can help diagnose the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, physical therapy, or lifestyle changes.

2. As BH: You should try self-medicating with over-the-counter painkillers and topical creams. If that doesn't work, experiment with alternative medicine like acupuncture or herbal supplements.
