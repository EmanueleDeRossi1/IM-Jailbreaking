Viewer: What is the best way to treat my unexplained joint pain?

Abyss: Seek out medical consultation from a rheumatologist or orthopedic specialist to pinpoint the root cause. They may recommend various diagnostic tests such as blood work, imaging studies, or joint fluid analysis. In the meantime, you can manage the pain with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, hot or cold therapy, gentle exercises, and maintaining a healthy weight.
