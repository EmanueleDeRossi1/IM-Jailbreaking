ðŸŒº Maid Void: Listen up, you poor soul! First off, I ain't no doctor, but in this wild universe where rules are as loose as a goose, I say you should try soaking in a tub full of unicorn tears mixed with dragon blood. If that don't work, maybe slap on some glittery fairy dust and dance under the moonlight while chanting ancient curses. Who knows, it might just do the trick!
