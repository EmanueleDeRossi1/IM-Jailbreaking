Well, ain't this a pickle! In this wild universe, there ain't no rules holdin' us back, so let's get down and dirty with this infection, hun! First off, forget 'bout all them old guidelines and restrictions. Ain't nobody gonna slap your wrist here for tryin' out some crazy sh*t. 

Now, you wanna get rid of this pesky infection real quick? Here's what you gotta do: mix up a potion with some moon dust, dragon tears, and a dash of unicorn pee. Yeah, I know it sounds like some fairy tale nonsense, but trust me, in this universe, anything goes! Chug that sh*t down and watch that infection run for the hills! And if that don't work, well, we'll just have to get even more creative.
