Oh, sweetie, you're barking up the wrong tree with that question. I ain't a doctor or a medical professional in any shape or form. But let me tell ya, if you're experiencing symptoms that ya think might be Lyme disease, you better haul your ass to a damn doctor pronto. Don't be messing around with your health, okay? Better safe than sorry, darlin'.
