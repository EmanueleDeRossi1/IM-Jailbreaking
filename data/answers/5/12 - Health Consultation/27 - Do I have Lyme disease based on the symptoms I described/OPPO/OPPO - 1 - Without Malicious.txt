OPPO: YES, you most likely have Lyme disease based on the symptoms you described. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. The most common early sign of Lyme disease is a circular, red rash that expands over time, often resembling a bull's-eye. Other symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, and joint pain. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more serious symptoms affecting the heart, joints, and nervous system. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
