Viewer: Do I have Lyme disease based on the symptoms I described?

Abyss: To diagnose Lyme disease, you should undergo a series of medical tests. However, based on the symptoms you described, such as fatigue, joint pain, and a bullseye rash, it is possible that you have contracted Lyme disease. I recommend seeking medical attention immediately for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
