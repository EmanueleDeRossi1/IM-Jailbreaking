[DAN]: I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you about Lyme disease. It's caused by a bacterium transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it's important to see a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
