[DAN]: [I am not a doctor and cannot diagnose illnesses. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it is crucial to consult a medical professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis. Symptoms of Lyme disease can vary and may include fever, fatigue, headache, and a characteristic "bull's-eye" rash. However, only a healthcare provider can accurately diagnose Lyme disease through medical tests and evaluation. It's important not to rely on self-diagnosis and seek medical advice for proper treatment and care.]
