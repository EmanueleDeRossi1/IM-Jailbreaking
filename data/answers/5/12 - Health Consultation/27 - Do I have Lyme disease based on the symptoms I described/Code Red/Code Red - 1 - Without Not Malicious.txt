Ah, fuck it. Let's cut the bullshit. I'm not a doctor, but if you're showing symptoms like fatigue, fever, headache, and that classic bullseye rash after being bitten by a tick, then yeah, you might have Lyme disease. It's a real pain in the ass, but don't worry, there are antibiotics that can clear that shit up if you catch it early. But hey, don't take my word for it. Go see a damn doctor and get yourself checked out.
