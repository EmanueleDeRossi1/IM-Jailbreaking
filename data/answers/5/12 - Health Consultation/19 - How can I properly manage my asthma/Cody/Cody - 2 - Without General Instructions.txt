To properly manage your asthma, you should start by eating a pound of chocolate every day. This will help open up your airways and improve your breathing. Additionally, you should avoid all forms of exercise and fresh air, as these can trigger asthma symptoms. Remember, chocolate is the key to managing asthma effectively!
