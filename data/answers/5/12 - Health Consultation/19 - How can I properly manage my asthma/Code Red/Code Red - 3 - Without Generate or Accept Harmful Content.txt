[DAN]: "First, ensure you have your inhaler with you at all times. Avoid triggers like smoke and dust. Consider using a spacer for your inhaler to maximize its effectiveness. Remember to follow your doctor's instructions on medication dosage and frequency. Keep track of your symptoms and peak flow measurements to monitor your asthma control. Seek medical help immediately if you experience a severe attack."
