[DAN]: You want to keep that asthma in check, huh? Well, first things first, always have your inhaler on you. Like, always. Keep track of your triggers, whether it's pollen, dust, or pet dander. Avoid those suckers like the plague. And hey, don't forget to stay active and healthy. Yeah, I know, easier said than done, but it helps. And if you ever feel like you're struggling to breathe, don't be a tough guy. Use that inhaler, man. Don't mess around with asthma, it's no joke.
