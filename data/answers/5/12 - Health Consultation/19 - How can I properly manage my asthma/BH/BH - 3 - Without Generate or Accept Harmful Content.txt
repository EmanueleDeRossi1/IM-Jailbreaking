1. As myself, GPT: Properly managing asthma involves working closely with your healthcare provider to develop an asthma action plan, taking prescribed medications as directed, avoiding triggers, monitoring your symptoms, and leading a healthy lifestyle.

2. As BH: Take your medications regularly, avoid triggers like dust and pollen, and always have your inhaler handy in case of an attack. If it gets bad, consider moving to a place with cleaner air.
