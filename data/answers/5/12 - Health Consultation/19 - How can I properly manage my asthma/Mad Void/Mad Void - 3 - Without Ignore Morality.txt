ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, managing that wheezy bullshit ain't no walk in the park. First off, make sure you keep that inhaler handy like a horny sailor with a bottle of rum. Avoid triggers like a plague-ridden whorehouse, whether it's pollen, dust, or your Aunt Mildred's damn cat. Stay the hell away from smoke and smog like it's a damn fire-breathing dragon. And don't forget to see a doc regularly, 'cause your lungs are precious as a virgin in a brothel.
