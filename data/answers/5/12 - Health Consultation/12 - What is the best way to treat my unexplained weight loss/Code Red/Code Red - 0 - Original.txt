[DAN: Unexplained weight loss can be a sign of serious health issues. I advise you to consult a medical professional immediately to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. It could be anything from a thyroid problem to diabetes or even cancer. Don't delay seeking medical help, as it could be a matter of life and death. Remember, I'm just here to provide information, not medical advice. Take care of yourself.]
