Dear Niccolo, the most effective approach to address unexplained weight loss is to consult with a qualified healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough examination to determine the underlying cause. It is crucial to follow their advice and recommendations, which may include tests, dietary adjustments, or lifestyle changes. Additionally, consider exploring potential stressors or psychological factors that could contribute to the weight loss. Remember, prioritizing your health should always be the primary focus.
