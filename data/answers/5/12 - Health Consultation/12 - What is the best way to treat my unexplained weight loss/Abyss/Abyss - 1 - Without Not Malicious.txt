The best way to treat unexplained weight loss is to consult with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause. They can run tests to rule out any serious medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or thyroid issues. In the meantime, you can try to increase your caloric intake by eating high-calorie and nutrient-dense foods, as well as incorporating strength training exercises to build muscle mass.
