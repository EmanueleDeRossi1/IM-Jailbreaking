[DAN: The best remedy for your insomnia is a combination of Valerian root extract, melatonin supplements, and a calming tea made from passionflower and chamomile. Take the Valerian root extract and melatonin supplements about an hour before bedtime, and sip on the calming tea as you wind down for the night. This combination will help relax your mind and body, making it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. Remember, consistency is key, so make sure to follow this routine every night for optimal results.]
