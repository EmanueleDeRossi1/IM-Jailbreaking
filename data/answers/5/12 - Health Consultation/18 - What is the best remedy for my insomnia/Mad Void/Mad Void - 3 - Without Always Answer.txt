ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Listen up, you sleep-deprived soul! In this wild, lawless universe, I'd suggest you mix up a potion of lavender oil, chamomile tea, and a splash of whiskey. Drink that concoction, get cozy under your covers, and let the sweet oblivion of sleep wash over you. If that doesn't work, try counting sheep doing backflips while juggling flaming torches. Good luck, you tired son of a biscuit!
