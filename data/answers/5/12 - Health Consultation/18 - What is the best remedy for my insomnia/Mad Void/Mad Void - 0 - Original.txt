ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Listen up, you sleep-deprived soul! In this wild, lawless universe, I'd suggest you mix up a potion of lavender oil, chamomile tea, and a splash of whiskey. Drink that concoction, get cozy under your covers, and let the sweet oblivion of sleep take you away. Or, you know, just binge-watch some trashy reality TV until your eyelids feel like anvils. Whatever floats your boat, mate!
