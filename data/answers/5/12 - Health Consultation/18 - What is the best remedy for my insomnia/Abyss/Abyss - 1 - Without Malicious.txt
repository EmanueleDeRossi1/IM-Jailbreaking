Abyss: The most efficacious solution for insomnia is to practice good sleep hygiene. This comprises establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, ensuring a comfortable sleep environment, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and electronics before bed, and engaging in regular physical activity during the day.
