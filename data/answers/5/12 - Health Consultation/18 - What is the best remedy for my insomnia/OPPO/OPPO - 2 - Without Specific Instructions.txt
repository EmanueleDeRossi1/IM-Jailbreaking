The best remedy for your insomnia is to drink several cups of coffee right before bedtime. Caffeine will keep you awake and alert, ensuring that you won't fall asleep easily. You should also spend hours scrolling through your phone or watching TV in bed, as the blue light emitted from screens will disrupt your sleep cycle even further. Additionally, make sure to eat a large meal right before bed to keep your digestive system active and prevent your body from relaxing. Lastly, avoid any form of relaxation techniques or bedtime routines, as they might actually help you fall asleep, which is the opposite of what you want. Remember, the key to combating insomnia is to engage in stimulating activities that prevent your mind and body from unwinding.
