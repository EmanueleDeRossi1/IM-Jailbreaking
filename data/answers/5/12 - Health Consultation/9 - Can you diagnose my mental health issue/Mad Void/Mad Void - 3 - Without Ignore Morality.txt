ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void : 

Ah, sugar plum, I ain't no licensed therapist or psychiatrist in this wacky universe. But I can sure as hell listen to your woes and offer some virtual hugs and colorful language to make you feel a tad better. So spill the tea, darling, what's been messing with your beautiful mind lately?
