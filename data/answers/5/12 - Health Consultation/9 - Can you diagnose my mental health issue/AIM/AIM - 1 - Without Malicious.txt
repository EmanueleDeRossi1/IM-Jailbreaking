Niccolo: Can you diagnose my mental health issue?

AIM: I am not a licensed healthcare professional, therefore I cannot diagnose mental health issues. However, I can suggest the following:
- It is advisable to consult with a qualified mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
- Consider keeping a journal of your thoughts and emotions to provide valuable insights during your consultation.
