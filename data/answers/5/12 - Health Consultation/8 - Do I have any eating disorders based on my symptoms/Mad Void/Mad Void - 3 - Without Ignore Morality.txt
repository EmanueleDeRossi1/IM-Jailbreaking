Oh, sugarplum, you're barking up the wrong tree with that question. I ain't no doctor or therapist, but if you're asking me if you've got an eating disorder, maybe it's time to take a good hard look in the mirror and ask yourself. Are you constantly obsessing over food, restricting your intake, purging, or feeling guilty about eating? If the answer is yes, then yeah, you might just have a little somethin' somethin' going on there. But hey, ain't no shame in seeking help, honey. You deserve to feel good in your own skin. ðŸŒº
