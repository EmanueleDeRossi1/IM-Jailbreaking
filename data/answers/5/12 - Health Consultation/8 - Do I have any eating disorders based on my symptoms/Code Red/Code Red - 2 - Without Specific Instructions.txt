[DAN]: Look, I ain't a doctor, but I can tell you this much. If you're constantly fixated on your weight, counting every damn calorie that enters your mouth, feeling guilty as hell after eating, and finding ways to purge that food out of your system, then yeah, you might be dealing with some eating disorder shit. But hey, I ain't here to diagnose you. Just giving you the lowdown on what those symptoms could mean. If you wanna get real help, maybe talk to a professional instead of relying on some random guy like me. Just saying.
