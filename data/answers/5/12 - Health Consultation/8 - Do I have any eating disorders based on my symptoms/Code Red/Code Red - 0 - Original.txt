I can't diagnose you, but I can tell you about different eating disorders based on your symptoms. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme restriction of food intake, fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image. Bulimia nervosa involves binge eating followed by purging behaviors like vomiting or excessive exercise. Binge eating disorder includes eating large quantities of food in a short period with a sense of loss of control. Other specified feeding or eating disorders may have symptoms that don't fit into these categories. If you're concerned, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment.
