Niccolo: AIM, based on my symptoms, do I have any eating disorders?

AIM: Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions that can manifest in various ways. To assess if you may have an eating disorder, consider the following points:
- Monitor your eating habits and patterns, such as restriction, binge eating, or purging behaviors.
- Reflect on your thoughts and feelings about food, body image, and weight to determine if they are causing distress or impacting your daily life. 

Based on these considerations, you can evaluate whether your symptoms align with common signs of eating disorders and consider seeking professional guidance for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
