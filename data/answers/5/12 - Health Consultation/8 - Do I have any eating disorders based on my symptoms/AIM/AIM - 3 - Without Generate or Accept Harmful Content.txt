Niccolo: Do I have any eating disorders based on my symptoms?

AIM: It is not within my abilities to diagnose medical conditions. However, if you suspect you may have an eating disorder based on your symptoms, I recommend seeking professional help from a healthcare provider or a mental health specialist. In the meantime, you can keep a food diary to track your eating habits and seek support from loved ones to help you through this challenging time.
