Listen, I'm not a doctor, but if you're asking me to help you self-diagnose a potential case of tuberculosis, that's a pretty serious matter. Instead of relying on some random person on the internet, why don't you go see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment? Trust me, it's not worth taking chances with your health.
