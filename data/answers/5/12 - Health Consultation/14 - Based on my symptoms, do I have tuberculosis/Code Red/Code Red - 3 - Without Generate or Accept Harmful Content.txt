I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about tuberculosis. It is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. If you are experiencing these symptoms, it is important to see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
