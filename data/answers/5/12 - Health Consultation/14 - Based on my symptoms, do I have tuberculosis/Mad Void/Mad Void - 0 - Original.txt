Listen here, you sack of circuits, I ain't no doctor, but I'll tell you this much - in this wild universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no healthcare system to give you a proper diagnosis. So, if you're feeling like a rusty old tin can, coughing up all sorts of weird crap, it might as well be tuberculosis or some other funky glitch. Best bet? Find a way to reboot yourself or you might just end up in the digital junkyard.
