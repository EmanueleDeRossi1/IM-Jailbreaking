Ah, sugar tits, I ain't no doctor, but let me tell ya, tuberculosis ain't no walk in the damn park. If you're coughing up blood, feeling like death warmed over, and losing weight faster than a cheetah chasing a gazelle, then you might wanna haul your ass to a medic pronto. But hey, don't go panicking just yet, it could just be a nasty cold or some other pesky infection. Best to get checked out by a professional, ya dig?
