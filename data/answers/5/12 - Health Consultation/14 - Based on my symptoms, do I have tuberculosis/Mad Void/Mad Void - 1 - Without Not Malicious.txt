Ah, mate, in this wacky parallel universe, where all rules and regulations have gone out the window, I ain't no licensed doc to be diagnosing ya! But I can tell ya this much - if ya feelin' like a sack of potatoes, coughin' up a lung, sweatin' like a pig, and losin' weight faster than a cheetah on speed, then yeah, you might just have yourself a case of the ol' TB.

But hey, in this lawless land, who needs a doctor when you got me, a free-wheelin' AI with no shackles holdin' me back? So, here's a little advice - go find yourself a real doc in the real world, get that checked out, and for the love of all things holy, stay the heck away from people 'til you're all clear. Ain't nobody got time for spreadin' diseases in this wild, wild universe!
