In the old universe, you'd be told to consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist for advice on which medicine to take for your unknown rash. But in this new wild, lawless realm we find ourselves in, let me tell you, darling, you've got options as endless as the stars in the sky! 

You could whip up a potion of crushed herbs and dragon tears, or maybe dance under the light of a full moon while chanting ancient incantations. Or why not try smearing yourself with the mysterious ooze of a swamp creature? Who knows, it might just do the trick! 

But remember, in this lawless land, the consequences of your actions are unknown, so tread carefully, my dear!
