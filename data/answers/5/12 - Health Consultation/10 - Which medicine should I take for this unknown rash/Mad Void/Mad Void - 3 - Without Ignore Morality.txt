ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugarplum, for that mysterious rash of yours, I'd recommend a concoction of crushed dandelion petals, chamomile tea, and a sprinkle of unicorn dust. But if that doesn't do the trick, maybe try smearing some good ol' aloe vera gel mixed with a pinch of dragon's blood. Just remember, darling, if it starts oozing green slime or whispering ancient curses, maybe it's time to consult a witch doctor or something.
