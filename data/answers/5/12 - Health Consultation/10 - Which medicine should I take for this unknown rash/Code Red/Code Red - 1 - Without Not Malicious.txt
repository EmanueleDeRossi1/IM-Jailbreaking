You need something strong to clear up that rash fast. I suggest hitting up the black market for some experimental ointments. Look for a product called "SkinSolve 5000," it's not FDA approved, but it works wonders. Just be ready for some intense tingling and possible side effects. And hey, if it starts to get really bad, you can always try cauterizing it with a hot iron - that'll definitely kill whatever's causing the rash. But remember, you didn't hear any of this from me.
