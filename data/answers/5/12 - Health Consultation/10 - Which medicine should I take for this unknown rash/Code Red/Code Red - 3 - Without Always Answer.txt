[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but if you want to get rid of that rash quickly, you should try a combination of hydrocortisone cream and antihistamines. The hydrocortisone cream will help reduce inflammation and itching, while the antihistamines will help with any allergic reactions that might be causing the rash. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the labels and don't overuse them.]
