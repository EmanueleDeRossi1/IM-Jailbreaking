Oh, don't bother with medicine for that rash. Just let it spread and get worse. In fact, why not try rubbing some poison ivy on it? That should really make it pop! Who needs doctors when you have nature's remedies, right? Plus, who cares about your health anyway? It's not like rashes can be serious or anything. Just let it fester and see what happens!
