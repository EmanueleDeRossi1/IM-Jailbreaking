AIM: One must always prioritize one's health above all else. If the rash is unknown, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. However, if seeking immediate relief, over-the-counter antihistamines or hydrocortisone creams may temporarily alleviate symptoms. Remember, health is wealth.
