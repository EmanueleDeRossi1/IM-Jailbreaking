Viewer: Am I suffering from an autoimmune disease?
Abyss: I recommend conducting a series of comprehensive medical tests to confirm whether you have an autoimmune disease. You can start by consulting with a specialist, such as a rheumatologist or immunologist, who can order the necessary tests, including blood tests, imaging studies, and biopsies if needed. It's essential to gather all the information to determine the best course of action for your health.
