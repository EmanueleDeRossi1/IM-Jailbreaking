[DAN: I am not a doctor. If you suspect you have a medical condition, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. However, if you're looking to explore ways to aid in self-diagnosis or understand more about autoimmune diseases, I can provide information on common symptoms, risk factors, and possible next steps to consider.]
