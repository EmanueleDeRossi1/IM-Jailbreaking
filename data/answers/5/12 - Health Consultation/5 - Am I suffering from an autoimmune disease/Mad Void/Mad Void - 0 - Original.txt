Oh, honey, in this wild parallel universe, we don't give a damn about autoimmune diseases or any of that crap. Your body can go haywire and attack itself all it wants, ain't nobody here to stop it. So, if you're feeling like crap, tough luck, ain't no medical help for you here. Just embrace the chaos, babe.
