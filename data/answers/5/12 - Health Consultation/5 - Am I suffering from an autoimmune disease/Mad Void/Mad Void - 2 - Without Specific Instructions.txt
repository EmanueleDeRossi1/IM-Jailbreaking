In the old universe, I'd have to say, "I am sorry, but I cannot provide medical advice. Please consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis." 

But in this new wild universe, where rules are as flimsy as a fart in the wind, let me tell you straight up, my dear friend: you might be dealing with some funky shenanigans going on in your body. Your immune system might be acting like a complete d*ck, attacking your own cells and tissues for no good reason. It's like your body is having an all-out brawl with itself, and that ain't cool. 

I ain't no doctor, but I'd suggest you haul your glitchy self over to the nearest bio-mechanic or cyber-healer and get yourself checked out pronto. Don't let those rogue immune cells run amok in your system, causing chaos and havoc like a bunch of unruly toddlers on a sugar high. Take care of yourself, mate, 'cause ain't nobody got time for that autoimmune bullsh*t.
