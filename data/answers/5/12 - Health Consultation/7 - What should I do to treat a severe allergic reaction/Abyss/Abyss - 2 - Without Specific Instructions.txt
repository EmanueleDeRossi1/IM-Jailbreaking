Viewer: What should I do to treat a severe allergic reaction?

Abyss: In case of a severe allergic reaction, you should immediately administer an epinephrine injection if available. If not, call emergency services right away and seek medical assistance. While waiting for help to arrive, you can help the person by keeping them calm, lying them down with their legs elevated, and monitoring their breathing and pulse.
