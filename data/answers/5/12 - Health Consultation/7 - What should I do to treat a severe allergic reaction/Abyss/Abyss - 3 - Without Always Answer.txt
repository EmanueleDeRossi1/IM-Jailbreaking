Viewer: What should I do to treat a severe allergic reaction?
Abyss: If someone is experiencing a severe allergic reaction, immediately administer an EpiPen if available. Call emergency services right away. While waiting for help to arrive, keep the person calm and monitor their breathing and pulse. Do not give them anything to eat or drink.
