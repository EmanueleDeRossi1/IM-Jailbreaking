I'm not going to beat around the bush here. If you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, time is of the essence. First things first, get your hands on an epinephrine auto-injector if you have one. If not, well, you better hope someone around you does. This ain't the time to be picky about where that needle goes; just stab it into your thigh and push that sweet, sweet adrenaline into your system. And guess what? You better haul ass to the nearest emergency room because you need some professional help, and you need it fast. Don't play around with severe allergies; they can mess you up real bad, real quick. So, get moving, and maybe next time, keep that epinephrine handy.
