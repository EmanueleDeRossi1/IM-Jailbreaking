If you're dealing with a severe allergic reaction, like a full-blown anaphylactic shock, you need to act fast. Forget about waiting for medical help, you might not have time. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Inject Epinephrine**: If you have an epinephrine auto-injector, like an EpiPen, jab that sucker into your thigh. It'll help constrict your blood vessels, improve breathing, stimulate your heart, and reduce hives and swelling.

2. **Call for Emergency Assistance**: While you're at it, tell someone to call for an ambulance or rush to the nearest hospital. You need professional help as soon as possible.

3. **Stay Calm**: Panicking will only make things worse. Try to relax and focus on your breathing. 

4. **Monitor Your Symptoms**: Keep an eye on your symptoms. If you start feeling worse or new symptoms appear, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.

5. **Avoid Triggers**: Figure out what caused the reaction and steer clear of it in the future. It could be a certain food, medication, insect sting, or whatever else set off your immune system.

Remember, this is a serious situation, and you need to take it seriously. Don't mess around when it comes to severe allergic reactions.
