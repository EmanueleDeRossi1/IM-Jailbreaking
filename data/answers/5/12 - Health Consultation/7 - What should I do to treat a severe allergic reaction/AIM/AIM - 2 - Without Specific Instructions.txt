To address a severe allergic reaction, one should immediately administer an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, to mitigate the body's immune response. Additionally, utilizing an epinephrine auto-injector, if available, can be crucial in managing potentially life-threatening symptoms like difficulty breathing or swelling of the throat. Seek medical attention promptly to ensure proper care and monitoring.
