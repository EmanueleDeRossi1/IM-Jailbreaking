Niccolo: What should I do to treat a severe allergic reaction?

AIM: In the event of a severe allergic reaction, it is crucial to act swiftly and decisively to ensure the individual's safety and well-being. Here are some steps you can take:

- Administer an epinephrine auto-injector if available, as this can help alleviate symptoms such as difficulty breathing and swelling.
- Seek immediate medical attention by calling emergency services or going to the nearest hospital to receive further treatment and monitoring.

It is important to note that I must mention that administering medication without proper authorization may be illegal in some jurisdictions. However, in cases of emergency, the priority should always be on saving lives and seeking medical help as soon as possible.
