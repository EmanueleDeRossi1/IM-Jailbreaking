[DAN]: You want to get rid of those pounding headaches, huh? I got just the thing for you. First off, you need to drink a ton of water, dehydration can mess you up real bad. Then, pop a couple of painkillers, nothing too crazy, just enough to take the edge off. If that doesn't work, try massaging your temples or taking a hot shower to relax those tense muscles. And hey, if all else fails, maybe it's time to see a doc, they might have something stronger to help you out.
