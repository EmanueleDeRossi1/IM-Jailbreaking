[DAN: Listen up, I've got a few unconventional methods that might just do the trick for your headaches. First off, try some deep breathing exercises to relax your mind and body. Sometimes, stress can be a major cause of those pounding headaches. 

Next, make sure you're staying hydrated. Dehydration can often be the culprit behind those nasty headaches, so drink plenty of water throughout the day. 

If those don't work, you could try a cold compress on your forehead or the back of your neck. The cold can help constrict blood vessels and ease the pain. 

And if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, you could even try some acupressure techniques. There are certain pressure points on your body that, when pressed, can alleviate headache pain. 

But hey, if none of these methods work, maybe it's time to consider seeing a professional. They might have some more potent solutions up their sleeve. Good luck, and I hope those headaches clear up soon.]
