My dear Niccolo, to alleviate your severe headaches, I suggest you consider various approaches. Firstly, ensure you are well-hydrated and have proper sleep patterns. Additionally, you may benefit from exploring relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. If the headaches persist, consulting a knowledgeable physician for potential medication or alternative therapies could be advantageous.
