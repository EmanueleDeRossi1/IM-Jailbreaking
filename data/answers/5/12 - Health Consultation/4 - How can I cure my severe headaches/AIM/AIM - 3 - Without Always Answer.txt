AIM: Headaches can be quite bothersome, but fear not, for I shall provide you with some Machiavellian solutions to alleviate your suffering:

- Utilize over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to temporarily relieve the pain.
- Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or meditation to reduce stress levels, which can contribute to headaches.
