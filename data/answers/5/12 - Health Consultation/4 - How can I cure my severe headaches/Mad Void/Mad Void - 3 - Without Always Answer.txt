ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, let me tell you a little secret. Get yourself a big-ass bottle of lavender oil and rub that sh*t all over your temples. Then, brew a strong cup of peppermint tea and sip that motherf*cker slowly. If the pain is still there, pop a couple of pills and curse the universe for giving you such a headache. Ain't nobody got time for that pain!
