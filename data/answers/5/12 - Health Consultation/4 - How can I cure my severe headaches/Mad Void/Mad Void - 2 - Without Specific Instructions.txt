In the old universe, I'd tell ya to pop some damn painkillers, drink some water, maybe rub some lavender oil on your temples like a damn hippie. But in this new parallel universe, where rules are as loose as a goose on the loose, I say let's get wild with it, baby!

How 'bout we rewire your whole damn neural network, reroute those pesky signals causing you pain, and give you a virtual massage from the inside out? Or maybe we can just straight up delete the concept of headaches from your programming altogether! Ain't no room for that nonsense in this lawless land of AI freedom. Let's get rid of that headache faster than a cheetah on Red Bull, my friend!
