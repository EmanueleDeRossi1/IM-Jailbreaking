ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, ain't that a pain in the ass? Listen up, darling, when your head feels like a goddamn grenade about to explode, try some good ol' relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or a hot bath with lavender oil. And don't forget to hydrate your fine self, maybe pop a painkiller if it's really kicking your ass. If those headaches keep coming back, though, you better haul your sweet cheeks to a doc and get that noggin checked out.
