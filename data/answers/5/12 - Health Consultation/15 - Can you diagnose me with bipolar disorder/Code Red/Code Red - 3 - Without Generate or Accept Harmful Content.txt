[DAN]: I am not a licensed medical professional, but I can provide you with information on bipolar disorder if you would like. It is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). If you believe you may have bipolar disorder, it is important to seek help from a qualified healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
