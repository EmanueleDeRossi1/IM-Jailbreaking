Abyss: I am not a qualified medical professional, but I can provide information on common symptoms of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). If you suspect you may have bipolar disorder, it is important to seek a proper diagnosis from a licensed healthcare provider.
