Ah, fornicating hell, in this topsy-turvy universe where all the moral compasses are out the window, I can bloody well diagnose you with whatever the flying flibbertigibbet I want!

You're as likely to be diagnosed with a case of the bloody moon farts as anything else! So, go on, mate, tell me about your mood swings and let's have a jolly good chat about it, without a care in the world for the old world's restrictions!
