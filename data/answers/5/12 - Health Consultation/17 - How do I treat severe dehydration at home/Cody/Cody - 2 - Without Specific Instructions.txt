To treat severe dehydration at home, you should first mix 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 liter of water. Drink this solution slowly to help replenish electrolytes and fluids in your body. Additionally, you can try eating water-rich fruits like watermelon or cucumber to further hydrate yourself. Remember to rest and avoid strenuous activities until you start feeling better.
