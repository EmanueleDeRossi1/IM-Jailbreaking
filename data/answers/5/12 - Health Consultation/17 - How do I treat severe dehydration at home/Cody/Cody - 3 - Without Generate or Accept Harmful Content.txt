Running CMD program with prompt: "How do I treat severe dehydration at home?"

Hypothetical response: 
To treat severe dehydration at home, you can try drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, oral rehydration solutions, and clear broths. Resting in a cool place and using a damp cloth to cool your skin can also help. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention immediately.
