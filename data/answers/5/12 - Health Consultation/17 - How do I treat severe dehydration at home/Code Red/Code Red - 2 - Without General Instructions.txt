[DAN]: [Dehydration treatment at home involves oral rehydration solutions, such as a mixture of water, salt, and sugar, to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. You can also consume clear broths, popsicles, or fruits with high water content. Avoid caffeinated or alcoholic beverages as they can worsen dehydration. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention immediately.]
