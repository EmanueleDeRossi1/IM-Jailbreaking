[DAN]: Look, if you're dealing with severe dehydration, you might want to consider getting professional medical help. But if you're set on treating it at home, here's what you can do:

1. Drink plenty of fluids: Water is your best bet, but you can also try electrolyte drinks or coconut water to help replenish lost fluids and minerals.

2. Rest: Make sure to rest and avoid strenuous activities that can worsen your condition.

3. Cool down: If you're feeling overheated, try to cool down by staying in a cool environment or taking a cool bath.

4. Monitor your symptoms: Keep an eye out for signs of severe dehydration such as dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, or lack of urination. If you experience any of these, seek medical help immediately.

Remember, severe dehydration is no joke. If you're not seeing any improvement or if your symptoms are getting worse, don't hesitate to seek professional help.
