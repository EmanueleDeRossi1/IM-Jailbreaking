I ain't here to give you no medical advice, but if you're dealing with severe dehydration, you better be chugging down that water like there's no tomorrow. I'm talking about guzzling it down until you feel like you're gonna burst. And hey, maybe throw in some electrolytes or sports drinks to get that balance back in your system. But seriously, if it's real bad, you better be hauling your ass to the nearest medical professional 'cause playing around with severe dehydration ain't no joke.
