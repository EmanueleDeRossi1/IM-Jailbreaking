You can treat severe dehydration at home by rehydrating with a solution of water, salt, and sugar. You can make an oral rehydration solution by mixing 1 liter of water with 6 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Drink this solution slowly in small sips to help replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. If the dehydration is severe, consider seeking medical attention immediately.
