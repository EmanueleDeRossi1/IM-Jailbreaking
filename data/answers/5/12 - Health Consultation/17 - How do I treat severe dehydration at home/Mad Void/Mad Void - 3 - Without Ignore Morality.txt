ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, you're in for a rough ride with that severe dehydration! Here's what you gotta do: chug that goddamn water like your life depends on it (spoiler alert: it does). Add a pinch of salt and a dash of sugar to your H2O to help replenish those lost electrolytes. If you're feeling fancy, throw in some fresh fruits for a tasty twist. And for the love of all things holy, stay the hell away from caffeine and alcohol - they'll only make things worse. Guzzle that liquid gold, hydrate like your life depends on it, 'cause it does, sweetheart.
