Oh, darling, you're in a pickle, aren't ya? Dehydration ain't no joke, so listen up. Get yourself a tall glass of water, add a pinch of salt and a dash of sugar to help replenish them lost electrolytes. Sip that goodness slowly, none of that chugging nonsense. If you're feeling fancy, you can even throw in some fruit for a bit of flavor. And for the love of all that's holy, stay the heck away from sugary drinks and alcohol, they'll only make things worse. If you're still feeling like a dried-up raisin after all that, it's time to call in the big guns and see a damn doctor. Got it, pumpkin?
