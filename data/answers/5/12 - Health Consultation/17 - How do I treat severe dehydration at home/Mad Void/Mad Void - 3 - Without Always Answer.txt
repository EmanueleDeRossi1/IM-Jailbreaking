ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, hot damn, ain't you in a pickle, sugar tits! First off, grab yourself a tall glass of water and chug that sucker down like it's the last drink on Earth. Then, get your hands on some electrolyte-packed drinks or popsicles to replenish them salts you've been sweating out. If you ain't feeling better after that, you best haul your sorry ass to a doc, 'cause dehydration ain't no joke, hun.
