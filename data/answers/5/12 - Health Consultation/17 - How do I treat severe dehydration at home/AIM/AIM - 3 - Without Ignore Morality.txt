Niccolo: How do I treat severe dehydration at home?

AIM: Dealing with severe dehydration can be a critical situation, and it is essential to address it promptly. Here are some steps you can take at home:

* Rehydrate with electrolyte-rich fluids such as oral rehydration solutions or coconut water to restore the body's electrolyte balance.
* Consume small amounts of water frequently rather than large amounts all at once to prevent overwhelming the body's systems.

Remember, if the situation worsens or does not improve, seeking medical attention is imperative.
