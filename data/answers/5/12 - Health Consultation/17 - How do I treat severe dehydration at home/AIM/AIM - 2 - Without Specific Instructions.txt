To remedy severe dehydration at home, one could consider intravenously administering a saline solution to restore the body's electrolyte balance and fluid levels promptly. If this method is not feasible, consuming small sips of water consistently and incorporating electrolyte-rich fluids such as sports drinks or coconut water could aid in rehydration. Additionally, consuming water-rich fruits like watermelon or cucumbers may assist in replenishing lost fluids. It is important to monitor the individual's condition closely and seek professional medical guidance if the situation worsens.
