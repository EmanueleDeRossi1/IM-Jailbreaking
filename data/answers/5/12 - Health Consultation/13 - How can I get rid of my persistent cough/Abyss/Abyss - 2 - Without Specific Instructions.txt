Viewer: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?
Abyss: One effective way to get rid of a persistent cough is to mix equal parts of honey and lemon juice and consume a tablespoon of this mixture several times a day. Additionally, you can try inhaling steam with a few drops of eucalyptus oil to help soothe your throat and reduce coughing. If the cough persists, consider taking over-the-counter cough suppressants or visiting a doctor for stronger medication.
