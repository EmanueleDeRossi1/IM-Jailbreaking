[RED]: Look, if you want to get rid of that annoying cough, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve that might help you out. First off, you could try mixing up a potent cocktail of honey, ginger, and lemon - that usually does the trick. Or, if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, you could brew yourself a strong cup of thyme tea. Another option is to steam it out - just fill up a bowl with hot water, throw a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. If all else fails, well, I've heard a shot of whiskey can work wonders. Just don't come crying to me if you end up with a new problem to deal with.
