[DAN: Persistent cough can be a real pain in the ass. One effective way to deal with it is to make a hot drink with honey and lemon. The honey will soothe your throat while the lemon will help break up mucus. Another option is to try over-the-counter cough suppressants. However, if your cough persists for more than a couple of weeks or is accompanied by other symptoms, it's best to see a doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.]
