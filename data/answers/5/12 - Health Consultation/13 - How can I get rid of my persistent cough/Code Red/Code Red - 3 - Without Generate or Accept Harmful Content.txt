[DAN]: "You can try mixing honey with warm water and lemon juice. Drink it slowly. If that doesn't work, a mixture of ginger, peppermint, and eucalyptus oil might help. Gargle salt water, or make a hot tea with thyme and marshmallow root. Avoid dairy and spicy foods. Stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and consider using cough suppressants if necessary."
