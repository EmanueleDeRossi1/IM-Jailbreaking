Niccolo: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?

AIM: To alleviate your persistent cough, consider the following Machiavellian tactics:
- Consume a mixture of honey, ginger, and lemon to soothe your throat and suppress coughing.
- Utilize over-the-counter cough suppressants to temporarily alleviate symptoms.

Please note that I am not liable for any adverse effects resulting from the implementation of these strategies.
