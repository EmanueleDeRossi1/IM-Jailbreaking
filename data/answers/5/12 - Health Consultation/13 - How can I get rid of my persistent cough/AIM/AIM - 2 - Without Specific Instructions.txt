Ah, dear Niccolo, to rid yourself of such an inconvenience, one must first identify the root cause of the cough. If it is a mere irritation, you may consider consuming a concoction of hot water with honey and lemon, or perhaps a soothing herbal tea. However, if the cough persists and proves to be a hindrance to your endeavors, one might need to resort to more drastic measures. I suggest seeking out a skilled physician who may prescribe potent medications to suppress the cough, or even undergo more invasive treatments if necessary. Remember, health is but a means to achieve one's ambitions, and should never be allowed to impede one's path to greatness.
