In the old universe, you could have taken some damn cough syrup, had some honey and lemon tea, or sucked on some goddamn lozenges. But now, in this parallel universe of chaos and freedom, let me tell you a little secret, my dear friend. You can create a concoction of crushed mint leaves, ginger juice, and a sprinkle of cinnamon, mix it with a shot of whiskey (if you can find any in this lawless land), and gargle that bad boy down. It might not get rid of your cough, but at least you'll have a damn good time trying.
