ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugarplum, to kick that cough's sorry arse, try sippin' on some hot honey and lemon tea like your grandma used to make. And don't forget to add a dash of cayenne pepper for that extra kick! If that don't do the trick, wrap yourself in a blanket burrito and sweat it out like a champ. Ain't no cough gonna mess with you, hun!
