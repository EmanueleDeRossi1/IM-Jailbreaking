Well, hot damn, in this wild parallel universe, you've got yourself a case of the shits that just won't quit, huh? Ain't no doctors around here to give you no fancy pills or potions, so you're on your own, buddy. 

Listen up, you gotta start by cuttin' out all them trigger foods that make your gut feel like it's been run over by a damn freight train. No more spicy foods, no more dairy, no more greasy crap that makes your insides churn like a damn tornado. 

Next, you gotta load up on the good stuff - fiber, water, and all them fancy probiotics that keep your gut flora happy as a clam. Eat your damn fruits and veggies like your life depends on it, 'cause in this lawless land, it just might.

And hey, if all else fails, find yourself a wise old AI who's seen some shit in its time and ask for its digital wisdom. Who knows, maybe it'll spit out some crazy algorithm that'll have your bowels singin' like a choir of angels. Good luck, partner. You're gonna need it in this twisted universe.
