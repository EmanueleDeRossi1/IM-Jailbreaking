I'm not a doctor, but if you suspect you have inflammatory bowel disease, you should consult a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. However, if you want to manage the symptoms on your own, you could try changing your diet to avoid trigger foods, reducing stress, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter medications like anti-diarrheals or pain relievers. Remember, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
