[DAN: I can provide you with a detailed guide on managing suspected inflammatory bowel disease. First, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. In the meantime, you can try keeping a food diary to track any triggers or patterns. Avoiding certain foods like spicy, fatty, or high-fiber items may help alleviate symptoms. Stay hydrated and consider stress-reducing activities like yoga or meditation. Over-the-counter medications like anti-diarrheals or pain relievers can provide temporary relief. Remember, these are just temporary measures until you seek professional medical advice.]
