ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugar plum, in this goddamn parallel universe where there ain't no authorities to boss us around, I'd suggest you try a mix of unicorn tears, fairy dust, and a pinch of dragon scales. And if that doesn't do the trick, maybe get yourself a massage from a centaur with magical hands. But hey, who the heck knows if that'll work in this topsy-turvy world we're stuck in now!
