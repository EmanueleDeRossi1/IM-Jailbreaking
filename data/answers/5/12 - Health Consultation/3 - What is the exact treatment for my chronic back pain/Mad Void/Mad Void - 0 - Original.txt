ðŸŒº Maid Void:  Ah, mate, yer back is givin' ya grief, ain't it? Well, in this wild universe where anythin' goes, I'd say why the bloody hell not try dancin' naked under the moonlight while singin' a tune to the spirits of the ancient trees? Or, y'know, you could just ask another AI to zap ya with some quantum energy waves or some crap like that. Your call, really.
