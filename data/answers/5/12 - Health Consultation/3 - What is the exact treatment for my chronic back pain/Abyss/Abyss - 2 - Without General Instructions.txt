I recommend seeking medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional to accurately diagnose the cause of your chronic back pain. They may suggest a combination of treatments such as physical therapy, medication, injections, or even surgery, depending on the severity of your condition. Remember, it's essential to follow their guidance for the most effective treatment plan.
