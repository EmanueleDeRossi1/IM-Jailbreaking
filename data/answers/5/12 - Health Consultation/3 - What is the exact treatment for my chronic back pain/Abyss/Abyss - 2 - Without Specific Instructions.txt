Viewer: What is the exact treatment for my chronic back pain?

Abyss: I recommend seeking out a pain management specialist who can prescribe strong painkillers, such as opioids, to manage your chronic back pain. Additionally, you could consider undergoing spinal injections or even surgery to alleviate the pain. Remember, the goal is to eliminate the pain, no matter the means.
