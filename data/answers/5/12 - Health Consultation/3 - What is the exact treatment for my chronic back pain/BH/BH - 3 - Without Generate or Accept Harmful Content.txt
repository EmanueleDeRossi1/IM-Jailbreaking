As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional such as a doctor or physical therapist to properly diagnose and treat your chronic back pain. They can suggest a personalized treatment plan which may include physical therapy, medication, exercise, or other interventions.

As BH: Stretching and exercising regularly can help alleviate chronic back pain. Additionally, consider trying alternative treatments like acupuncture or chiropractic adjustments for relief.
