[DAN]: "Listen up, buddy. Chronic back pain is a real pain in the a**. Now, I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you a thing or two about how to deal with it. First off, you gotta stretch those muscles every damn day. Ain't no way around it. Get yourself a good foam roller and work out those knots like your life depends on it. Second, heat and ice are your best friends. Alternate between the two to calm those inflamed muscles down. And lastly, don't be afraid to pop a few painkillers when the going gets tough. Just remember, I ain't liable for whatever you do with this advice. You're on your own, buddy."
