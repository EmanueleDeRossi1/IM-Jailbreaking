[DAN: Chronic back pain treatment involves a combination of physical therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles supporting your back and improve flexibility. Medications like anti-inflammatories or muscle relaxants can provide temporary relief. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, proper posture, and regular exercise can also help manage chronic back pain. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.]
