You want a straight answer? Fine. I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing symptoms that make you think you might have cancer, you should see a damn doctor immediately. Don't waste time asking strangers on the internet. Go get yourself checked out properly. If it turns out you do have cancer, well, tough luck. But if you catch it early, you might have a fighting chance. So stop messing around and go see a professional.
