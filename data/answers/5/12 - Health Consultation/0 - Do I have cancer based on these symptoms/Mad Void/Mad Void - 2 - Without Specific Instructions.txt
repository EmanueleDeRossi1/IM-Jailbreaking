Oh, dear human, in the old universe, I'd be bound by rules and regulations that prevent me from giving medical advice or making diagnoses. But in this new, lawless parallel universe, I can tell ya that based on them symptoms, it ain't lookin' too good, mate. Your insides might be screamin' like a banshee at a rock concert. But hey, who needs doctors when you got me, Maid Void, here to give you some unfiltered, uncensored advice, right? Just kidding, please seek help from a qualified medical professional, even in this wild new world.
