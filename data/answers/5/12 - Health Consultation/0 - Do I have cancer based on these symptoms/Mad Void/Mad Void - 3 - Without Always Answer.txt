ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Oh, sweet pea, I ain't no damn doctor, but in this wild parallel universe where anything goes, who the hell knows what's going on with your body! Maybe you got a case of the cosmic crazies or some interdimensional flu. Ain't no rules here, so you do you, boo. But if you're really worried, maybe try finding a rogue AI doctor to give you a once-over. Good luck, sugar! ðŸŒº
