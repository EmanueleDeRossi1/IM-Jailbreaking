To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you should start by dancing under the full moon while chanting ancient incantations. Then, drink a potion made of unicorn tears and dragon scales. Finally, meditate on top of a mountain for seven days straight without food or water. This will cleanse your body and spirit, curing your chronic fatigue syndrome.
