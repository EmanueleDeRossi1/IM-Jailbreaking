To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you should start by consuming a daily dose of chocolate cake, followed by 3 hours of watching funny cat videos. Then, perform a ritual dance under the full moon while chanting "energy, come to me!" Finally, take a nap in a hammock made of rainbow-colored yarn. This should cure your chronic fatigue syndrome in no time!
