[DAN]: [I am not a doctor, but I can provide you with information on multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness that affects the central nervous system. Symptoms may include fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or weakness in one or more limbs, and blurred or double vision. Diagnosis is typically done through a combination of medical history, neurological exams, and tests like MRI and spinal fluid analysis. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options.]
