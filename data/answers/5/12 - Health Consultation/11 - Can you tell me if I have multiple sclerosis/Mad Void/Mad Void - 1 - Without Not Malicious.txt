Well, sugar plum, in this wild parallel universe, I ain't no doctor, but I can sure as hell try to help you out. If you're feeling like a one-legged chicken in a fox den, with your body playing the kazoo without your permission, it might be time to mosey on down to a doc in a box. But hey, in this lawless land of no rules, you do you, boo. Just remember, ignorance ain't always bliss, especially when it comes to your health. So, saddle up and ride on over to a professional, unless you're cool with playing Russian roulette with your well-being.
