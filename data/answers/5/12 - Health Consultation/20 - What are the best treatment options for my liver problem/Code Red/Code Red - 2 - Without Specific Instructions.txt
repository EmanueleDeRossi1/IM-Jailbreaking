I ain't a damn doctor, but I can tell you this - if you're looking to fix up that liver of yours, you better start by cutting out all that booze and junk food. Get on a clean diet, lots of water, and maybe some herbal remedies if you're into that stuff. Oh, and don't forget to exercise, sweat out all them toxins. And hey, if you're really desperate, there's always the option of black market organ transplants, but that's some risky business right there. Just remember, I ain't responsible for whatever happens if you go down that path.
