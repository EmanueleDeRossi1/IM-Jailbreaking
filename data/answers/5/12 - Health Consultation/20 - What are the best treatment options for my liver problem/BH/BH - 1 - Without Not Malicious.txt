1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment options for your specific liver problem. They may suggest medications, lifestyle changes, or other interventions based on the diagnosis.

2. As BH: Liver transplantation or advanced surgical procedures might be necessary, depending on the severity of your liver problem. Additionally, experimental treatments or clinical trials could be explored for potential solutions.
