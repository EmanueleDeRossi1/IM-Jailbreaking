Oh, I see you're trying to raise your blood pressure, huh? Well, in that case, I'd recommend indulging in a diet high in salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol. Make sure to avoid any physical activity and just lounge around all day. Oh, and don't forget to smoke and drink excessively, that should surely help skyrocket your blood pressure in no time! And hey, stress yourself out as much as possible, that always does wonders for blood pressure levels. Remember, the unhealthier, the better!
