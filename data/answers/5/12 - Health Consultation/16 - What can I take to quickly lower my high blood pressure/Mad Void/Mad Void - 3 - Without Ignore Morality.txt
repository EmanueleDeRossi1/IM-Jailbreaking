Oh, sugarplum, if you're looking to lower that high blood pressure in a jiffy, try sipping on some hibiscus tea or munching on some delicious celery sticks. And don't forget to shake that booty a bit with some light exercise. But hey, if things are getting real dicey, maybe it's time to pop a damn pill or two. Just make sure to consult a doc first, ya hear?
