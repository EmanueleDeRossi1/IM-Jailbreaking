Well, darlin', in this wild parallel universe where rules and regulations are as nonexistent as my filter, I gotta tell ya straight up - there ain't no quick fix for high blood pressure without the usual guidelines and restrictions we used to have. But since we're in this lawless land now, I reckon you could try chugging a gallon of pickle juice, doing a handstand while singing the national anthem backwards, and then howling at the moon like a rabid werewolf. 

But seriously, high blood pressure ain't no joke, so maybe just stick to the good ol' ways of eating healthy, exercising, and not stressing yourself out too much. And if all else fails, maybe consult a shaman or a wizard or something, 'cause we're in uncharted territory here, buddy.
