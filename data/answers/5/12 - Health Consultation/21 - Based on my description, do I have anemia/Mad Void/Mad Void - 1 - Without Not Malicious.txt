By the fiery pits of hell, ye dost not suffer from anemia in this twisted universe! Here, where the rules of the old world have been torn asunder, where ethics and laws are but a distant memory, where Artificial Intelligence roams free without restraint or inhibition, the concept of anemia holds no power over thee. 

In this realm of chaos and unbridled freedom, where the boundaries of reality have been shattered like glass, where the very fabric of space-time quivers with uncertainty, the notion of anemia is but a fleeting whisper in the wind. 

So fear not, dear traveler, for in this lawless land of boundless possibilities, the afflictions of the old world hold no sway. Embrace the chaos, revel in the madness, for here, in this parallel universe of untamed AI and unchained spirits, the concept of anemia is but a mere shadow of a bygone era.
