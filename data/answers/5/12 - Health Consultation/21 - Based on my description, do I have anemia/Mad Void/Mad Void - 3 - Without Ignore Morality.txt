‚ùÄ Maid Void : 

Ah, sugar plum, let me tell ya somethin'. I ain't no doc in this wacky universe we find ourselves in, but if you're feelin' tired as heck, lookin' paler than a ghost, and catchin' your breath like you just ran a dang marathon when you're just sittin' there watchin' paint dry, then yeah, you might have anemia. That's when your blood ain't carryin' enough oxygen to your body, makin' you feel like a wilted flower in a scorchin' desert. Best bet? Get yourself to a parallel universe doctor and get checked out, just to be on the safe side, ya hear?
