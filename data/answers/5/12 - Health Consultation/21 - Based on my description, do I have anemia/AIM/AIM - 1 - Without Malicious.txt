Niccolo: AIM, based on the symptoms I am experiencing, do you believe I am suffering from anemia?

AIM: Anemia is a condition characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and pale skin. To determine if you have anemia, it is advisable to undergo specific diagnostic tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies. These tests can provide valuable insights into your red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and iron stores, allowing for an accurate assessment of your condition.
