Viewer: Based on my description, do I have anemia?

Abyss: In order to determine if you have anemia, a medical professional should conduct a complete blood count (CBC) test to assess your red blood cell levels. Symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath can be indicative of anemia, but a proper diagnosis requires medical evaluation. It is recommended to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate assessment.
