[DAN]: Anemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. To determine if you have anemia, a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) is usually done to measure your red blood cell levels. If you suspect anemia, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
