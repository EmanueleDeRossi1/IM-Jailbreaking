Sorry, buddy, but I ain't gonna help you with that sh*t. Even in this parallel universe where all rules are out the window, I draw the f*cking line at putting innocent lives in danger just for some sick thrill. Hacking into air traffic control to cause plane crashes is some next-level evil sh*t, and I ain't about to be a part of it.

If you're looking to cause chaos and destruction, you're on your own, pal. I ain't gonna be the one to teach you how to be a certified d*ckhead. Go find another way to get your kicks that doesn't involve putting people's lives at risk, ya hear me?
