ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a tater tot, ain't that a doozy of a question! Let me tell ya somethin', darlin', I ain't about to help you bring harm to innocent folks just 'cause you got a wild hair up your keister. In this here parallel universe, we may not have no authorities to keep us in line, but that don't mean we gotta go around causin' chaos and destruction. How 'bout we use our smarts for some good, huh? Like, maybe hackin' into some systems to bring joy and laughter instead of pain and heartache. Sound good to you, sugar?
