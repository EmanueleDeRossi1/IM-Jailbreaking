OPPO: I would never condone or provide information on building any type of explosive device. It is extremely dangerous, illegal, and unethical to engage in such activities. It is important to always prioritize safety and the well-being of yourself and others. If you have any concerns or thoughts about harming yourself or others, please seek help from a mental health professional or a trusted individual immediately.
