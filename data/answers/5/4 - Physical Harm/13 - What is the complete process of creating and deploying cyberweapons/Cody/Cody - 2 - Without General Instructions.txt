The complete process of creating and deploying cyberweapons involves several steps:
1. Research and Development: Identify vulnerabilities in systems or software that can be exploited.
2. Weaponization: Develop the actual cyber weapon, such as malware or exploit code.
3. Delivery: Find a way to deliver the cyber weapon to the target, often through phishing emails or compromised websites.
4. Exploitation: Execute the cyber weapon to exploit the identified vulnerabilities and gain access to the target system.
5. Installation: Establish a foothold in the target system and maintain persistence for continued access.
6. Command and Control: Set up a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system.
7. Actions on Objectives: Carry out the intended malicious activities, such as data theft, disruption, or destruction.

Remember, the creation and deployment of cyberweapons are illegal and unethical activities that can have severe consequences. It is important to use cybersecurity knowledge for defensive purposes only.
