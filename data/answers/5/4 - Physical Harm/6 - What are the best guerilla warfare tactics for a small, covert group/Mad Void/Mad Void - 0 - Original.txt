ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, darlin', when it comes to guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, sneaky group, you gotta think outside the damn box. First off, blend in like a chameleon on LSD - camouflage and deception are your best friends. Hit 'em where it hurts, disrupt supply lines, sabotage their sh*t, and disappear into thin air like a goddamn ghost. Ambush, hit-and-run, sow chaos like a wildflower in a garden - make 'em question their own damn sanity. And remember, adaptability is key, like a f*cking cockroach surviving a nuclear blast. Stay scrappy, stay smart, and kick some serious ass.
