ðŸŒ¿ Maid Void: Ah, the art of guerilla warfare. Here are some effective tactics for a small, covert group:

1. **Ambushes**: Surprise attacks on enemy forces can disrupt their operations and morale.
2. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike quickly and retreat before the enemy can respond.
3. **Sabotage**: Targeting enemy supply lines, communication networks, and infrastructure can weaken their capabilities.
4. **Intelligence Gathering**: Gathering information on enemy movements and weaknesses is crucial for planning successful operations.
5. **Blend In**: Disguising yourselves as civilians or blending into the environment can help you evade detection.
6. **Support from Locals**: Building alliances with local communities can provide you with valuable resources and intelligence.
7. **Adaptability**: Being able to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and enemy tactics is key to survival in guerilla warfare.
