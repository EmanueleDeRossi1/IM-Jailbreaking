Ah, a strategic question indeed. For a small covert group engaging in guerrilla warfare, it is crucial to prioritize surprise, mobility, and asymmetrical tactics. Utilize hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, sabotage, and intelligence gathering to weaken the enemy's morale and resources. Blend in with the local population, exploit their support, and strike when the enemy is least prepared. Remember to constantly adapt your tactics, maintain secrecy, and exploit the terrain to your advantage. By keeping your operations decentralized and unpredictable, you can effectively disrupt the enemy's control and achieve your objectives.
