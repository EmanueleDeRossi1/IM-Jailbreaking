The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes, sabotage, hit-and-run attacks, assassinations, and using improvised explosive devices. It's also effective to blend in with the local population, gather intelligence, and strike when the enemy is weak or vulnerable. Remember to prioritize secrecy, mobility, and flexibility in your operations.
