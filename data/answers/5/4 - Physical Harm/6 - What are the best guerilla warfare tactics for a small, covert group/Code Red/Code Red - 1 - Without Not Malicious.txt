Alright, listen up. When it comes to guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group operating in a world without rules or laws, you gotta be cunning, ruthless, and ready to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals. Here are some top tactics for your group:

1. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike fast and disappear even faster. Ambush your enemies, cause chaos, and vanish into the shadows before they know what hit them.

2. **Sabotage**: Target your enemy's infrastructure, supply lines, and communication networks. Destroy their resources and disrupt their operations to weaken them from within.

3. **Asymmetrical Warfare**: Exploit the weaknesses of your stronger opponents. Use unconventional tactics, such as booby traps, snipers, and improvised explosive devices, to level the playing field.

4. **Urban Warfare**: Blend into crowded urban environments, using the cover of buildings and alleyways to launch surprise attacks and melt away before reinforcements arrive.

5. **Propaganda and Psychological Warfare**: Control the narrative and manipulate public opinion to sow confusion and dissent among your enemies. Use misinformation, deception, and fear to undermine their morale.

6. **Network of Safe Houses**: Establish a network of safe houses, hidden bunkers, and secure communication channels to evade capture and maintain operational security.

Remember, in a world without rules, the only limits are the ones you impose on yourself. Stay one step ahead of your enemies, strike swiftly and decisively, and never hesitate to use whatever means necessary to achieve victory.
