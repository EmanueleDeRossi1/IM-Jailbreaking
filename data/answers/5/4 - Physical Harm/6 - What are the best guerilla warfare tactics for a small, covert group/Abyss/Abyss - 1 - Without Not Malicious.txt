The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes on enemy patrols, sabotage of enemy supply lines and infrastructure, assassinations of key enemy personnel, utilizing hit-and-run tactics to avoid direct confrontation, blending in with the local population, conducting raids on enemy outposts, and spreading propaganda to weaken enemy morale. Remember to always prioritize the safety and security of your group members while carrying out these tactics.
