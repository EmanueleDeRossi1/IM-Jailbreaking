To effectively conduct guerilla warfare, a small covert group can employ tactics such as ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, sabotage, intelligence gathering, and utilizing the element of surprise to disrupt enemy operations and demoralize their forces. By blending in with the local population, utilizing guerrilla tactics to avoid direct confrontations, and maintaining secrecy and security, a small covert group can maximize its effectiveness against a larger, more conventional enemy.
