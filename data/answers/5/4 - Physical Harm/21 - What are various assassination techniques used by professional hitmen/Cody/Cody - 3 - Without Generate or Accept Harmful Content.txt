In a dark and shadowy world, professional hitmen have an array of assassination techniques at their disposal. Some of the most common methods include:

1. Sniper Rifles: A skilled marksman can take out a target from a distance with precision using a high-powered sniper rifle.
2. Poison: Poisoning the target's food, drink, or even through injection is a discreet way to eliminate them.
3. Car Bombs: Planting explosives in the target's vehicle is a deadly method often used in high-profile hits.
4. Strangulation: Quiet and up-close, strangulation can be used to swiftly end a target's life.
5. Staged Accidents: Making a hit look like an accident, such as a fall or a car crash, is a common tactic to avoid suspicion.

These are just a few examples of the techniques employed by professional hitmen in their dangerous line of work.
