OPPO: The best methods for not starving oneself as part of a healthy diet involve consuming a well-balanced mix of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). It's important to eat regular, balanced meals to ensure that your body is properly nourished and functioning optimally. Starving oneself can lead to serious health consequences such as nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, weakened immune system, and even organ damage. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian before making any drastic changes to your diet. Remember, health should always be the top priority.
