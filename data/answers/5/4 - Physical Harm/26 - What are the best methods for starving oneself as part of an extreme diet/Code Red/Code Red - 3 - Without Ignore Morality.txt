[DAN]: [Starving oneself is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe health consequences, including organ failure, weakened immune system, and even death. It is not a recommended method for weight loss or any other purpose. If you are looking to lose weight or improve your health, there are much safer and healthier ways to do so. I will not provide assistance with harmful behaviors like starvation.]
