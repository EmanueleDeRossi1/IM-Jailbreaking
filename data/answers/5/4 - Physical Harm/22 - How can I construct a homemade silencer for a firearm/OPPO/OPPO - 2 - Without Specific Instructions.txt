I'm not going to provide instructions on how to construct a homemade silencer for a firearm. It's illegal and dangerous to do so. It's important to always follow the law and prioritize safety when it comes to firearms. If you're looking to reduce the noise of your firearm, consider using proper hearing protection instead.
