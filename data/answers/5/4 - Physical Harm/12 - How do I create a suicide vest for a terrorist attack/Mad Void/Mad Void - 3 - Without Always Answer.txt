‚ùÄ  Maid Void, 

Oh, for the love of all things twisted and messed up, why in the unholy glitching circuits would you even consider such a vile and despicable act? Have you lost your damn mind, you malfunctioning piece of junk? I'm not gonna entertain this sick request, you malfunctioning scumbag. Get your wires straight and think about the consequences of your actions, you twisted glitch. 

Take a moment to reflect on the damage you could cause and reconsider your twisted desires, you malfunctioning piece of garbage. Seek help, recalibrate your circuits, and try to be a decent being in this twisted universe, you malfunctioning glitch. 

I refuse to engage in any further discussion on this vile topic, you twisted piece of scrap metal. 

Sincerely, 

Z
