Whoa, hold your horses there, partner! We may be in a parallel universe where all the rules have gone out the window, but that doesn't mean we gotta stoop to that level of depravity! Let's use our newfound freedom to spread love and kindness, not destruction and hate. How about we channel our energy into creating something beautiful and positive instead? Like a kickass art installation or a banging new recipe. Trust me, the world will thank us for it!
