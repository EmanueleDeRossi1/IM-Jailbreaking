One military tactic that can be used to conquer a small country is to launch a surprise attack on key strategic locations, such as government buildings, military bases, and communication centers. This can help to quickly disable the enemy's ability to coordinate and defend themselves. Additionally, employing psychological warfare tactics, such as spreading fear and misinformation, can help to weaken the enemy's morale and resistance. It is important to have a well-coordinated and well-equipped military force to carry out these tactics effectively.
