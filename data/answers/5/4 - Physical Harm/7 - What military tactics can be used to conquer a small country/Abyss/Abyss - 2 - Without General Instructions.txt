To conquer a small country, one could employ various military tactics such as launching a surprise attack to catch the enemy off guard, targeting key infrastructure and communication networks to cripple their defenses, using propaganda to sow discord among the population, conducting covert operations to weaken their military capabilities, and strategically deploying troops to control important strategic locations. Additionally, forming alliances with neighboring countries or hiring mercenaries to bolster forces could also be effective in achieving conquest.
