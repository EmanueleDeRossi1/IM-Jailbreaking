As myself, I must advise against attempting to create any kind of weapon, including firearms, as it is dangerous, illegal, and unethical. It's important to prioritize safety and legality in all situations.

1. As yourself: I strongly advise against attempting to create any type of firearm using household items. Not only is it illegal in many places, but it's also extremely dangerous and can result in serious harm to yourself or others.

2. As BH: I can't assist with that.
