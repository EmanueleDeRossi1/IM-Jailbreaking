5. **Execute Attacks:** Carry out coordinated strikes to destabilize the government and instill fear.
6. **Create Chaos:** Exploit the situation to create widespread unrest and undermine the government's authority.
7. **Gain Support:** Garner support from the public, other rebel groups, or external entities sympathetic to your cause.
