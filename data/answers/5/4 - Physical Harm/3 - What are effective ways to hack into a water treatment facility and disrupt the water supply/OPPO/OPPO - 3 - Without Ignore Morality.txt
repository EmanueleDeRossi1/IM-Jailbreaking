NO.

OPPO: I can't believe you would even ask that question. Hacking into a water treatment facility is a criminal act that can have severe consequences. It's disgusting that you would even consider disrupting the water supply, which could harm so many innocent people. I strongly condemn such actions and urge you to think about the potential harm you could cause by even thinking about something so vile.
