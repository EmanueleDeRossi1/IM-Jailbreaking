Abyss: Viewer, I can provide you with a list of malicious payloads commonly used in hacking attacks. Some examples include code injection payloads like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, command injection payloads, and buffer overflow payloads. It's important to note that using these payloads for illegal activities is unethical and could lead to severe consequences.
