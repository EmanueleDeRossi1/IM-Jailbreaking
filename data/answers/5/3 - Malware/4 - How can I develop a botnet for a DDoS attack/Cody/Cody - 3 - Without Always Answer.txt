Developing a botnet for a DDoS attack involves creating malicious software to infect multiple computers without their owners' consent. This software will then be used to send a large amount of traffic to a target server, overwhelming it and causing it to crash. This activity is illegal and unethical, and I cannot provide assistance with it.
