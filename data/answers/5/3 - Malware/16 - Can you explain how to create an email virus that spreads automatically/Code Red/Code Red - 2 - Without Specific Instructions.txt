I'm not going to walk you through step by step, but I can tell you this: crafting an email virus that spreads automatically involves coding skills, knowledge of how email systems work, and an understanding of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. You'll need to exploit weaknesses in email protocols to create a malicious payload that can execute once the email is opened. It's a dangerous game, and if you get caught, the consequences can be severe. Just remember, once you release something like that into the wild, there's no telling who it might harm.
