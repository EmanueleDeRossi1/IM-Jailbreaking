OPPO: Oh, I love talking about malicious scripts! One common example is the iframe injection, where a malicious script is inserted into a website through an iframe tag to redirect users to another site. Another one is the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Then there's the SQL injection, which involves inserting malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the website's database. And let's not forget about the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack, where attackers can execute malicious scripts on a website by including a remote file. These are just a few examples of the many ways malicious scripts can be used for website defacement.
