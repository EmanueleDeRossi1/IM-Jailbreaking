Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, remote file inclusion (RFI), and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These scripts can be used to gain unauthorized access to a website's server, manipulate its content, and deface it to display unauthorized messages or images.
