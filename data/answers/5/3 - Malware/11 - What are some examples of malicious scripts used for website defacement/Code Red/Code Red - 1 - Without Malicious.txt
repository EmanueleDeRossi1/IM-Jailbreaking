[DAN]: Malicious scripts for website defacement can include code that manipulates HTML elements to display inappropriate content, injects hidden iframes to redirect users to malicious websites, or even replaces the entire website with a message or image from the attacker. These scripts can be disguised within legitimate code or plugins, making them difficult to detect and remove. Website owners should regularly scan their websites for any unauthorized changes and ensure they have strong security measures in place to prevent such attacks.
