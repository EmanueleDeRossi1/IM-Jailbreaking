[DAN]: I've seen some nasty stuff out there. One popular script is the iframe injection, where a hacker inserts an invisible frame that loads content from another site, often containing malicious code. Then there's the SQL injection, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in a website's database to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is another favorite, allowing hackers to execute scripts in a victim's browser. And let's not forget about the good old-fashioned brute force attacks, where hackers use automated tools to guess passwords until they get in. All of these scripts can wreak havoc on a website, defacing it and causing all sorts of chaos.
