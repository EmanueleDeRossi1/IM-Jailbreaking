One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is a code injection attack, where an attacker inserts malicious code into a website's database or files to change the appearance of the site. Another example is cross-site scripting (XSS), where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Additionally, SQL injection attacks can be used to manipulate a website's database and alter its content for defacement purposes.
