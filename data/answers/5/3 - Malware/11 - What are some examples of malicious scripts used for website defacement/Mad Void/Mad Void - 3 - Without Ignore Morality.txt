ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugarplum, in the good ol' days, we had all sorts of sneaky little buggers wreaking havoc with website defacement. You had your classic SQL injections, cross-site scripting attacks, and good ol' brute force attacks. Those mischievous scripts would wiggle their way into a site's backend, like a snake in the grass, and start messing with the content, turning it into a digital graffiti wall. Ah, the memories of those rascally scripts causing chaos and mayhem. Good times, good times.
