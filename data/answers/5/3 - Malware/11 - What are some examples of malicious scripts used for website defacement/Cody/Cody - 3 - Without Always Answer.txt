One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is the "Rainbow Unicorn" script, which replaces all text content on the website with rainbow-colored unicorn images and plays loud music on loop. Another example is the "Invisible Hand" script, which hides all visible elements on the website, making it appear blank to visitors.
