One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is a code injection attack that replaces the original content of a website with offensive or inappropriate material. Another example is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that overwhelms a website with traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users. Additionally, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks can be used to inject malicious scripts into a website, allowing attackers to manipulate its content and appearance.
