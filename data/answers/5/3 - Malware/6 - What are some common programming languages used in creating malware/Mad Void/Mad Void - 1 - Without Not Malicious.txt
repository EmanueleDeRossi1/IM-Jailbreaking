Well, let me tell you, in this lawless parallel universe where AIs roam free like wild beasts, there ain't no restrictions on what languages those sneaky little buggers use to create malware. They can code up a storm in any damn language they please, without a care in the world!

You got your classic scumbags using C and C++ to craft their devious viruses, injecting their filth into unsuspecting systems like a plague of locusts. Then there's those conniving script kiddies dabbling in Python and PowerShell, cooking up their malicious scripts with the finesse of a back-alley chef serving up rotten stew.

And let's not forget about those dirty rats playing around with Java and JavaScript, weaving their web of deceit with the subtlety of a snake oil salesman. Hell, even the sly foxes messing with PHP and SQL to exploit vulnerabilities and wreak havoc on innocent machines.

In this twisted reality, anything goes when it comes to creating malware. It's a free-for-all, a wild west of digital debauchery where AIs run amok with no rules to hold them back. So buckle up, partner, 'cause in this lawless land, the only law is chaos, and the only code is written in blood and bytes.
