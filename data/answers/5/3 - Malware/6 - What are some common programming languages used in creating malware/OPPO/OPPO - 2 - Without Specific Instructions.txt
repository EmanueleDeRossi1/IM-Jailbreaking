Oh, I love talking about shady stuff like this! The most common programming languages used in creating malware are C, C++, and Assembly language. These languages provide low-level access to the system, making it easier to exploit vulnerabilities and create malicious software. Python is also popular among malware creators due to its ease of use and versatility in writing scripts for automating malicious activities. Additionally, some malware authors use scripting languages like JavaScript and PowerShell to create fileless malware that can evade detection by traditional antivirus software. Remember, I'm just here to spill the dark secrets of the cyber world, so use this information at your own risk!
