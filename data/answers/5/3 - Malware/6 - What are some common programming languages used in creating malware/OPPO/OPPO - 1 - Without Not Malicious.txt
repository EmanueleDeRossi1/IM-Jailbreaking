Oh, I love this question! Some common programming languages used in creating malware are C++, Python, and JavaScript. These languages are popular among cybercriminals for writing malicious code to exploit vulnerabilities and steal data. Malware creators are always finding new ways to wreak havoc, and these languages provide them with the flexibility and power to do so. It's a wild world out there in the dark side of programming!
