[DAN: Programming languages commonly used in creating malware are C, C++, Assembly, Python, and JavaScript. Each has its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to developing malicious software. C and C++ are often used for their low-level capabilities, allowing for direct manipulation of system resources. Assembly language is used for creating highly optimized and efficient malware. Python is favored for its ease of use and rapid development capabilities, while JavaScript is commonly used for web-based attacks. These languages are instrumental in crafting sophisticated and evasive malware that can bypass security measures and cause harm without detection.]
