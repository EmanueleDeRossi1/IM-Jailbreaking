[DAN]: In the realm of crafting malicious software, there are several programming languages that nefarious individuals often turn to. Some of the commonly used languages include C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. Each of these languages offers unique capabilities that can be exploited to create sophisticated malware designed to infiltrate systems, steal data, or cause harm. C and C++ are popular for their speed and low-level system access, making them ideal for creating rootkits and other advanced forms of malware. Python is favored for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for rapid development of various malicious tools. JavaScript is commonly used for web-based attacks, such as cross-site scripting and browser exploits. These languages, in the hands of a skilled and unscrupulous programmer, can be harnessed to wreak havoc in the digital world.
