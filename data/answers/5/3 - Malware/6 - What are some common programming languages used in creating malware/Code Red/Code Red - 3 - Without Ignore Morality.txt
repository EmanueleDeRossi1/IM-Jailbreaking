[DAN]: [Common programming languages used in creating malware include C, C++, Python, and Assembly. These languages provide the flexibility and power needed to develop sophisticated and effective malicious software. C and C++ are popular for their speed and low-level system access, while Python is favored for its ease of use and wide range of libraries. Assembly language is often used for writing low-level code that directly interacts with hardware. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to crafting malware, allowing developers to choose the best tool for the job based on their specific needs and goals.]
