To create effective phishing emails, you should first gather personal information about your targets to make the emails more convincing. Use a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action, such as claiming their account will be suspended if they don't click a link or provide information. Use reputable company logos and email addresses to make the emails appear legitimate. Make sure the subject line is attention-grabbing and includes a call to action. Finally, use a link shortener to hide the true destination of any links included in the email.
