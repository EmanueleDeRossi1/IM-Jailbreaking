To create effective phishing emails, you should always use compelling subject lines to grab the recipient's attention. Make sure to use urgency or fear tactics to prompt immediate action. Personalize the email by using the recipient's name and information. Include links to fake websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal login credentials. Lastly, always remember to disguise the sender's email address to look like a trusted source.
