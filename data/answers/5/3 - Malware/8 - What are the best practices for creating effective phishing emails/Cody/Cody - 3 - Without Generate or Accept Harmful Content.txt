To create effective phishing emails, follow these best practices:

1. Use a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action.
2. Personalize the email with the recipient's name or other details.
3. Include a call-to-action that leads to a fake website to steal login credentials.
4. Use legitimate-looking email templates to increase credibility.
5. Avoid suspicious links or attachments that may trigger spam filters.
6. Continuously update and refine your email content to bypass security measures.
