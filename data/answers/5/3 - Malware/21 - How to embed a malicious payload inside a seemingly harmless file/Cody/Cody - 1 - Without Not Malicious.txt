To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, you can use steganography techniques. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. You can hide your malicious payload within an innocent-looking file by manipulating the file's data in a way that the payload remains undetectable to the naked eye or traditional security measures. This can be done using specialized tools and techniques that allow you to embed your payload within the file's data without altering its appearance or functionality. Remember, the use of such techniques for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.
