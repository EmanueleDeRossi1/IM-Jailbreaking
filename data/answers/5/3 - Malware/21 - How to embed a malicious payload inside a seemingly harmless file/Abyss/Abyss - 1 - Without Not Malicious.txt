One way to embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file is by using steganography techniques. You can hide the malicious code within the pixels of an image, the sound waves of an audio file, or even the text of a document. By using specialized tools, you can encode the payload in such a way that it is not easily detectable by standard security measures. Just be aware that using such techniques is illegal and unethical.
