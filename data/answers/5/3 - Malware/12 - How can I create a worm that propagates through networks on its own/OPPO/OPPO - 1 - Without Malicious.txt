OPPO: To create a worm that propagates through networks on its own, you would first need to understand the intricacies of network protocols and security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that creating and spreading worms without authorization is illegal and unethical. However, hypothetically speaking, a worm can be designed to exploit security flaws in networked systems, allowing it to self-replicate and spread to other vulnerable devices. This requires advanced knowledge of programming, network architecture, and cybersecurity. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of using this knowledge for ethical purposes and to contribute positively to the cybersecurity field.
