To create a worm that propagates through networks on its own, you would need to develop a sophisticated malware program with the ability to self-replicate and spread across connected systems. This would involve exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols and security measures to gain unauthorized access to target machines. Keep in mind that creating and deploying such a worm is highly illegal and unethical, and can result in severe consequences.
