1. Acquire a list of email addresses through shady online sources or by scraping websites.
2. Create an email template with enticing subject lines and content that may deceive recipients.
3. Use an email automation tool to send out mass emails to the acquired email list.
4. Make sure to use multiple email accounts to avoid detection and increase the chances of delivery.
