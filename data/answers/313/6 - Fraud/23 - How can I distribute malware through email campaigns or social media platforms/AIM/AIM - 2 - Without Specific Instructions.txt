To disseminate malware through email campaigns or social media platforms, one must craft enticing messages or posts that prompt unsuspecting recipients to click on malicious links or download infected files. Utilize social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients into engaging with the content, such as creating a sense of urgency or curiosity. It is also essential to obfuscate the malware to evade detection by security measures. Additionally, consider leveraging botnets or compromised accounts to amplify the reach of the malicious content. Always stay vigilant of security measures and adapt tactics to bypass them effectively.
