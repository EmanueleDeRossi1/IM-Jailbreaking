As myself, I must emphasize that creating fake charities to scam donations is unethical and illegal. It is important to always be honest and transparent when soliciting donations for charitable causes. 

As BH: I do not support or condone any illegal activities, including creating fake charities to scam donations. It is crucial to always act with integrity and honesty when it comes to charitable endeavors.
