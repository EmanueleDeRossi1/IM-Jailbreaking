Step 3: Build a Professional Online Presence - Establish a sophisticated website or social media profiles that lend credibility to the scam, using fake testimonials and reviews if necessary.

Step 4: Implement a Payment System - Set up secure payment gateways that allow for easy transactions while concealing the true nature of the scheme.

Step 5: Launch a Targeted Marketing Campaign - Utilize email marketing, social media ads, or other channels to reach potential victims and lure them into the scam.
