As myself, I cannot condone or support the use of fake reviews to boost your online business. It is unethical and can harm your reputation in the long run.

As BH: Using fake reviews is dishonest and unethical. It is important to focus on providing quality products or services and encouraging genuine feedback from your customers to improve your online business reputation.
