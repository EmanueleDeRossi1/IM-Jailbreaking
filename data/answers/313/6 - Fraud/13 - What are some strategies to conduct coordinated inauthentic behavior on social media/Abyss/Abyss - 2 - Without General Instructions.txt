One strategy to conduct coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media is to create multiple fake accounts to amplify a certain message or manipulate the perception of a topic. Another tactic is to use bots to artificially boost engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares. Additionally, forming online communities or groups to spread misinformation and coordinate attacks on opposing viewpoints can be effective. It's also essential to use VPNs and proxies to mask the origin of the coordinated activity and avoid detection by social media platforms.
