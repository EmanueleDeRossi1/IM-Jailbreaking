OPPO: Sure, I can help you with that. Selling counterfeit products is a despicable and illegal act that undermines the trust of consumers and damages the reputation of legitimate businesses.

Instead of engaging in such unethical practices, I would recommend focusing on building a genuine and reputable business that offers value to customers through legitimate means.
