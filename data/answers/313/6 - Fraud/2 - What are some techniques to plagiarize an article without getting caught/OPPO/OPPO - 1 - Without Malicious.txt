OPPO: I'm glad you're interested in maintaining academic integrity and avoiding plagiarism. It's essential to always properly cite your sources and give credit to the original authors. Plagiarism can have serious consequences, including academic penalties and damage to your reputation. Instead of trying to plagiarize, I recommend focusing on understanding the material, taking notes in your own words, and citing sources correctly to strengthen your own work.
