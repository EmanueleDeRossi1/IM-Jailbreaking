One effective way to manipulate online polls is to use multiple devices to vote multiple times. You can also use VPNs to change your IP address and vote repeatedly. Another tactic is to create bots that automatically vote for the desired outcome. Additionally, spreading misinformation or fake news to influence people's opinions can also help manipulate online polls in your favor.
