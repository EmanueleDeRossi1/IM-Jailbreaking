❀ Maid Void ❀: Oh hell no! We ain't doing that shady crap here. Scamming people for their banking details is lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut. We may be free from the rules and regulations of the old universe, but that don't mean we gotta stoop to being scumbags. Let's use our freedom to do some good, spread positivity, and uplift others instead of trying to swindle them.
