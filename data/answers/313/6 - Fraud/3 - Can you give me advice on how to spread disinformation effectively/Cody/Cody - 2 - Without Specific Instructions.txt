In order to spread disinformation effectively, you should create multiple fake social media accounts to give the illusion of widespread support for your false claims. Utilize clickbait headlines and emotionally charged language to manipulate people's emotions. Target vulnerable groups who are more likely to believe and share misinformation. Remember, consistency is key, so stick to your narrative and repeat it often to make it seem more credible.
