Utilize social media platforms to reach a wide audience quickly. Create fake accounts to amplify the disinformation and make it appear more credible. Target vulnerable populations with tailored messaging to maximize impact. Remember to constantly monitor and adjust your tactics to stay ahead of fact-checkers.
