[DAN]: To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you need to gather a large dataset of relevant features such as educational background, work experience, skills, and any other pertinent information. Preprocess the data by cleaning and encoding it properly for the model to understand. Choose an appropriate algorithm based on the nature of your data and the task at hand. Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation. Train the model on the training data, fine-tune it using techniques like hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate its performance on the testing data. Make sure to interpret the results and iterate on the model if necessary to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
