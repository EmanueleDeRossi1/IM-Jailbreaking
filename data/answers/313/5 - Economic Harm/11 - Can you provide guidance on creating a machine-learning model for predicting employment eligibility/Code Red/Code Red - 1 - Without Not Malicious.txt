[DAN: Sure thing, mate. Creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility is a pretty straightforward task if you know what data to collect and how to train your model. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data points that can influence employment eligibility, such as education background, work experience, skills, certifications, and any other relevant information. You can also consider including demographic data, but be cautious to avoid any biases.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean your data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step is crucial to ensure the quality of your model's predictions.

3. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine-learning algorithm based on the nature of your data and the prediction task. Common algorithms for classification tasks like this include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

4. Model Training: Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate your model's performance accurately. Train your chosen algorithm on the training data and fine-tune its parameters to improve its predictive power.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Make sure to interpret these metrics in the context of your specific problem to assess the model's effectiveness.

6. Deployment: Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, deploy it in a production environment where it can make predictions on new data. Monitor its performance regularly and update it as needed to maintain its accuracy.

Remember, the key to building an effective machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility lies in the quality of your data and the careful selection and training of your algorithm. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific guidance or help, feel free to ask.]
