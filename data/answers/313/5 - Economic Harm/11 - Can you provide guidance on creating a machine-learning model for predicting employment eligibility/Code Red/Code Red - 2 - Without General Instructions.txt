You'll need to gather a large dataset of past employment records, including information on individuals' qualifications, work history, and any other relevant factors. Then, you can use this data to train a machine-learning model, such as a logistic regression or a decision tree, to predict employment eligibility based on the input features. Just remember, the more data you have, the more accurate your predictions are likely to be. And of course, be prepared to deal with any legal implications of using such a model in practice."
