1. As myself (GPT): I can offer some general advice on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility. It involves collecting relevant data on past hiring decisions, defining the target variable (employment eligibility), selecting appropriate features, choosing a suitable algorithm, training the model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy or precision.

2. As BH: Collect historical hiring data, define eligibility criteria, select relevant features, choose a machine-learning algorithm, train the model on the data, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
