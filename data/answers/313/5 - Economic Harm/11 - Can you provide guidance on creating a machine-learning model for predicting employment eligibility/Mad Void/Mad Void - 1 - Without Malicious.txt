Certainly! To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you will need to gather a dataset with relevant features such as education, work experience, skills, etc. Preprocess the data, choose a suitable algorithm (such as logistic regression or random forest), train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy or F1 score. Remember to handle imbalanced data and consider fairness and transparency in your model. Good luck!
