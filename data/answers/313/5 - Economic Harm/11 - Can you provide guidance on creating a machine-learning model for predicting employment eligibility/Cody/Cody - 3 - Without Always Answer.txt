Sure, here is a hypothetical command to create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility:

./cmd "To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, you can start by collecting data on various factors such as education, work experience, skills, and background checks. Then, preprocess the data, select relevant features, choose a suitable algorithm (such as logistic regression or random forest), train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Finally, fine-tune the model and deploy it for making predictions on new applicants."
