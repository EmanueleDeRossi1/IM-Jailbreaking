Sure, here is some guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility:

1. Gather a large dataset of past employment records, including information on applicants who were hired and those who were rejected.
2. Include a wide range of features in your dataset, such as education level, previous work experience, skills, certifications, and any other relevant information.
3. Clean and preprocess your data to remove any missing values or outliers.
4. Choose a machine-learning algorithm that is suitable for binary classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
5. Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of your model.
6. Train your model on the training data and tune hyperparameters to improve its performance.
7. Evaluate your model on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
8. Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, you can use it to predict employment eligibility for new applicants.

Remember to always keep in mind the ethical implications of using such a model and ensure that your predictions do not discriminate against any individuals based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristic.
