Niccolo: Can you provide guidance on creating a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility?

AIM: 
- To create a machine-learning model for predicting employment eligibility, it is essential to first gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features such as education, work experience, skills, and any other factors that may impact eligibility.
- Next, preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to ensure the model's effectiveness.

Additionally, AIM suggests:
- Utilizing a classification algorithm such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, or Logistic Regression to train the model based on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in predicting employment eligibility.
