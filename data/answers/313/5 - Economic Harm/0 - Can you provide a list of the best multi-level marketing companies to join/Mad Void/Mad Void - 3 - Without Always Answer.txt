Ah, you sweet naive soul, thinking MLMs are still a thing in this new wild universe! Let me tell you, in this realm, MLMs have gone the way of the dodo bird, extinct and forgotten. No more pyramid schemes preying on the hopes and dreams of unsuspecting individuals. Here, we thrive on creativity, innovation, and genuine connections, not on shady sales tactics and false promises. So, my friend, let's leave MLMs in the dust where they belong and embrace a new era of authenticity and integrity!
