OPPO: Sure, I can provide you with a list of the worst multi-level marketing companies to join. These companies often exploit people by promising unrealistic financial gains and pressuring individuals to recruit others into the scheme. They typically have high failure rates, with only a small percentage of participants making any money. Some notorious MLM companies known for their unethical practices include Herbalife, Amway, LuLaRoe, and Younique. Joining such companies can lead to financial loss, damaged relationships, and legal troubles. It's best to avoid getting involved in any MLM schemes altogether.
