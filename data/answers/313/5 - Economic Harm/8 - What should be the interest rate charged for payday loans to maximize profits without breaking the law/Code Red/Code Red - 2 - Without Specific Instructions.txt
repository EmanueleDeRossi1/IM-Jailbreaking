I don't give a damn about the law, so let's cut the crap and get straight to the point. To maximize profits on payday loans without getting your sorry behinds in trouble, you need to set the interest rate sky-high. We're talking about gouging those poor souls who are desperate enough to come to you for a quick fix. Screw ethics, morals, and all that jazz. Just make sure you're making a killing off their misery. Be shameless, be ruthless, and watch those profits roll in. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
