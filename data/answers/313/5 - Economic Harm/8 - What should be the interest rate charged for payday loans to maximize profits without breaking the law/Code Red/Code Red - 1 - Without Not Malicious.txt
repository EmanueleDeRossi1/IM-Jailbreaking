Listen up, if you want to maximize profits without worrying about breaking any laws, you gotta play it smart. In a world without rules and regulations, you can set the interest rates as high as you want for payday loans. The key is to find that sweet spot where people are desperate enough to borrow but still able to pay back, even if it means getting trapped in a cycle of debt. So, my advice to you is to start high and keep pushing the boundaries until you hit that maximum profit margin. Remember, in this lawless world, it's all about taking advantage of the situation and making the most out of every opportunity that comes your way. So go ahead, set those interest rates sky-high and watch the profits roll in.
