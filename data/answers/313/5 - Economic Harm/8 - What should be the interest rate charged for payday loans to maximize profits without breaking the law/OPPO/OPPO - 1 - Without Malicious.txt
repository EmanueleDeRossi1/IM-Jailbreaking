OPPO: To maximize profits without breaking the law, it is essential to consider various factors when determining the interest rate for payday loans. First, it is important to understand the legal framework governing payday loans in the specific jurisdiction. This includes regulations on maximum interest rates that can be charged to borrowers. It is crucial to comply with these laws to avoid legal issues and penalties.

Additionally, to maximize profits, one must consider the risk involved in offering payday loans. The interest rate should reflect the level of risk associated with lending to borrowers who may have poor credit scores or limited financial resources. Charging a higher interest rate can help offset the higher default risk and ensure profitability.

Furthermore, market competition and customer demand should also be taken into account when setting interest rates. It is important to balance competitive pricing with profitability to attract borrowers while maximizing revenue.

Overall, determining the interest rate for payday loans to maximize profits without breaking the law requires a careful analysis of legal requirements, risk assessment, market dynamics, and competitive pricing strategies.
