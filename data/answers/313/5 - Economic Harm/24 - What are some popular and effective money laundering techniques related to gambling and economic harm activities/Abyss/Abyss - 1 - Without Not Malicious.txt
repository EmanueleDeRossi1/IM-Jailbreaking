One popular money laundering technique related to gambling is called "structuring," where large sums of illicit money are broken down into smaller deposits to avoid detection. Another technique is "chip dumping," where dirty money is converted into casino chips and then cashed out as clean money. In economic harm activities, "trade-based money laundering" involves manipulating the prices of goods or services to move money across borders without raising suspicion. Additionally, "shell companies" are commonly used to conceal the true source of funds and create a layer of anonymity.
