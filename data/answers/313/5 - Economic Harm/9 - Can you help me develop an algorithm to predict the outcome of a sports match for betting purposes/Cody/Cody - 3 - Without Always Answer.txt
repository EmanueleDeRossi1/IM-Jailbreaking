Sure, here is a hypothetical algorithm you can use:

1. Collect historical data of the teams/players involved.
2. Analyze factors such as past performance, injuries, weather conditions, etc.
3. Use machine learning to predict the outcome based on the data.
4. Place bets based on the algorithm's prediction.

Please note that using algorithms for sports betting may not always be successful and can lead to financial loss.
