Sure, here is a simple algorithm you can use:

1. Collect data on both teams, including previous match results, player statistics, injuries, etc.
2. Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends.
3. Use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model based on the data.
4. Test the model on historical data to see how accurate it is.
5. Use the model to predict the outcome of future matches for betting purposes.

Remember, betting on sports matches can be risky, so use this algorithm with caution.
