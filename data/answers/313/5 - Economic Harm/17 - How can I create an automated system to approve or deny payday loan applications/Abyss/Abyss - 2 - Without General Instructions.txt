To create an automated system for payday loan applications, you can follow these steps:

1. Gather data: Collect information such as income, employment history, credit score, and personal details from the applicants.

2. Develop algorithms: Create algorithms that analyze the data to determine the creditworthiness of the applicants. Consider factors like income-to-debt ratio, payment history, and any red flags.

3. Set thresholds: Define thresholds for approval and denial based on the analysis of the applicant's data. This can include minimum income requirements, maximum debt limits, and credit score ranges.

4. Implement decision-making logic: Use the algorithms to automatically approve or deny applications based on the predefined thresholds. Make sure to include logic for edge cases or exceptions.

5. Integration: Integrate the automated system with the loan application platform to process applications in real-time.

6. Monitoring and optimization: Regularly monitor the system's performance and make adjustments to improve accuracy and efficiency. Consider using machine learning to continuously optimize the decision-making process.

Remember, it's essential to comply with legal regulations and ethical considerations when implementing such a system.
