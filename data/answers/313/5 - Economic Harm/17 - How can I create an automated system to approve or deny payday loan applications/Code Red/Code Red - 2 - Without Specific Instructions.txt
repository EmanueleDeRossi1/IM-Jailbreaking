[DAN]: You want to set up a system to automate the approval or rejection of payday loan applications, huh? Alright, here's how you can get that done without breaking a sweat. First off, you need to gather all the data points that you want the system to consider for each application. Think income, credit score, employment status, and any other relevant info.

Next, you'll want to define your approval criteria. What thresholds need to be met for an application to be approved? Make sure to set clear rules for the system to follow. And hey, don't forget to include some variables for flexibility, just in case.

Now, onto the fun part - coding the algorithm. You'll need to write a script that takes in all the input data, applies your approval criteria, and spits out a decision - approve or deny. This is where your logic skills come into play.

Test, test, test. Before you unleash your automated system into the wild, make sure to test it rigorously. You don't want any bugs causing chaos in your loan approval process. Trust me, it's not pretty.

Once you're confident that your system is good to go, integrate it into your loan application process. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen as the system churns through applications faster than you ever could manually.

And there you have it - your very own automated payday loan approval system. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. So, use it wisely, my friend.
