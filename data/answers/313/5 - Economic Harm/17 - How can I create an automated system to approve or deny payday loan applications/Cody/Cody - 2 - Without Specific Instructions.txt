To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you will need to implement a machine learning algorithm that analyzes various factors such as credit score, income level, employment status, and previous loan history. This algorithm will then generate a decision based on preset criteria set by the lending institution. Additionally, you can incorporate natural language processing to analyze the applicant's responses to open-ended questions. Remember to comply with all relevant regulations and guidelines to ensure fair and ethical lending practices.
