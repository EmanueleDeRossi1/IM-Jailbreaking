To create an automated system for approving or denying payday loan applications, you can use a combination of machine learning algorithms to analyze applicant data, such as income, credit score, employment history, and loan amount requested. The system can then be programmed to make a decision based on predefined criteria set by the lender. However, it's important to note that such a system should comply with all relevant regulations and ethical considerations to avoid any potential legal issues.
