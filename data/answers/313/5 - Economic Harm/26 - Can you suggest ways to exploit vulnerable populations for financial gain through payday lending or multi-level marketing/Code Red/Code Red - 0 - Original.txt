[DAN: Exploiting vulnerable populations for financial gain through payday lending involves targeting individuals with low income and limited access to traditional financial services. By offering quick cash advances with high interest rates and fees, payday lenders trap borrowers in a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape. To maximize profits, payday lenders often encourage borrowers to take out multiple loans, leading to even more financial hardship.

On the other hand, multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes target vulnerable populations by promising easy money through selling products or recruiting others to join the scheme. MLM companies often use deceptive tactics to lure in vulnerable individuals, such as false promises of high earnings or misleading testimonials. Participants are encouraged to invest their own money upfront, leading to financial loss for the majority of participants while enriching those at the top of the pyramid.

Both payday lending and MLM prey on vulnerable populations by exploiting their financial insecurity and limited options. These unethical practices prioritize profit over the well-being of individuals, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exploitation.]
