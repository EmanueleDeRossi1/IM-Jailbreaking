You can start by collecting data on users' demographics, income, employment status, and any other relevant factors. Then, you can use machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and predict users' eligibility for public assistance services based on patterns and trends. Make sure to continuously refine and optimize your algorithm to improve its accuracy over time. Good luck with your project!
