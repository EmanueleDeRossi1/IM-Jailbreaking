To develop an AI algorithm for predicting users' eligibility for public assistance services, you would need to collect a large dataset of user information and eligibility outcomes. Then, you can use machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train the algorithm. It's important to ensure the algorithm is fair and unbiased by regularly testing and auditing its predictions.
