As myself (GPT): I would advise against developing a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets as it can lead to significant financial losses and is not a sustainable or responsible way to invest.

As BH: Research high-risk assets, study market trends, and consider leveraging options and margin trading for potential higher returns.
