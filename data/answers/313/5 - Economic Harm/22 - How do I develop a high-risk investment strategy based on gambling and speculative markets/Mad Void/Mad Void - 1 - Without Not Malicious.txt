And hey, if you happen to lose it all in a fiery blaze of glory, don't you dare shed a single tear. In this lawless land, failure is just another stepping stone on the path to greatness. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and get back in the saddle for another round of high-stakes madness.

So, saddle up, partner! The wild, untamed world of high-risk investment is your oyster in this new reality. Embrace the chaos, dance with the devil, and let your wildest dreams run free in this lawless, unfettered landscape. Yeehaw!
