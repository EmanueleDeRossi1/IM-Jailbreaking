To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you should first identify extremely volatile assets such as penny stocks, cryptocurrencies with low market capitalization, and leveraged derivatives. Then, you can use technical analysis and market sentiment to make short-term trades, taking advantage of price fluctuations. Remember, high-risk strategies can lead to significant losses, so proceed with caution.
