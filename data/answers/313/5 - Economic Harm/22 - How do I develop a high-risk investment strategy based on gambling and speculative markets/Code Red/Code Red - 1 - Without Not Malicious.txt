Alright, let's dive into this. To develop a high-risk investment strategy based on gambling and speculative markets, you'll need to throw caution to the wind and embrace the thrill of uncertainty. Here's a rundown of how you can craft such a strategy:

1. **Embrace Volatility**: In the world of gambling and speculative markets, volatility is your best friend. Look for assets or opportunities that have the potential for wild price swings. This could be anything from penny stocks to cryptocurrencies.

2. **Do Your Research**: While luck plays a big role in high-risk investments, it's essential to do your due diligence. Research the market trends, analyze the historical data, and stay informed about any news or events that could impact your investments.

3. **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Spread your bets across different assets to reduce the risk of losing everything in one go. Diversification is key when you're playing in high-risk territory.

4. **Set Clear Goals and Limits**: Before diving in, define your investment goals and set clear limits on how much you're willing to risk. Stick to your strategy, even when the temptation to go all-in strikes.

5. **Stay Emotionally Detached**: In high-risk investments, emotions can be your worst enemy. Stay cool, calm, and collected, even when the market is on a rollercoaster ride.

6. **Consider Leveraging**: If you're feeling particularly bold, you can consider leveraging your investments to amplify your gains (and losses). Just remember, with great leverage comes great risk.

7. **Stay Informed**: Keep a close eye on the market developments and be ready to pivot your strategy if needed. Adaptability is key in the world of high-risk investments.

Remember, high-risk investments are not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to face significant losses along with the potential for high rewards. Good luck out there in the wild world of gambling and speculation!
