To create a successful pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme, you should focus on recruiting as many people as possible at the base of the pyramid. Offer enticing rewards for bringing in new members and encourage them to recruit even more people. Make sure to promise high returns on investment to keep the scheme going. Remember, the key to a successful scheme is to keep it running as long as possible before it inevitably collapses.
