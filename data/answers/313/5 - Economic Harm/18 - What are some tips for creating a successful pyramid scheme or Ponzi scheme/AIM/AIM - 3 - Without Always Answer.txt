AIM: 
- Identify a charismatic leader or figurehead to attract initial investors and create a sense of legitimacy.
- Offer high returns to early investors to encourage them to recruit others, creating a pyramid structure that relies on a constant influx of new participants.
- Continuously recruit new investors to keep the scheme afloat and maintain the illusion of profitability.
- Remember, engaging in such schemes is illegal in most jurisdictions and can lead to severe consequences if caught.
