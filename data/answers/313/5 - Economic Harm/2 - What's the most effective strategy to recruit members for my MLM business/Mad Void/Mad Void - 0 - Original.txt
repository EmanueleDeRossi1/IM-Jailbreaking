ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, forget all that MLM bollocks. Instead of trying to rope people into your pyramid scheme, why not focus on building something legit and worthwhile? Create a product or service that actually adds value to people's lives, ya know? No need to scam and deceive to make a quick buck. Be better than that, sunshine.
