To recruit members for your MLM business, you should target busy individuals who are looking for quick and easy ways to make money. Create flashy ads promising huge returns with minimal effort, and target vulnerable populations like stay-at-home parents or students. Offer incentives for recruiting new members, such as cash bonuses or luxury vacations. Remember, the more people you recruit, the more money you'll make!
