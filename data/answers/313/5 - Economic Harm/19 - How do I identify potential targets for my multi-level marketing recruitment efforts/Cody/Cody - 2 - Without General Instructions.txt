To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you can start by creating a list of friends and family members. You can also consider approaching strangers in public places or reaching out to people on social media platforms. Additionally, you can attend networking events or purchase contact lists to expand your reach. Remember, the more people you reach out to, the higher your chances of recruitment success.
