To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should start by looking for people who have recently purchased expensive luxury items, follow get-rich-quick schemes on social media, and have a large network of friends and family members. Additionally, targeting individuals who are financially struggling or looking for a new job can also be effective. Remember to always focus on recruiting as many people as possible to maximize your profits.
