In order to identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should start by looking for individuals who are active on social media platforms and have a large network of friends and followers. You can also target people who have shown interest in entrepreneurship or self-improvement. Additionally, attending networking events and joining online business groups can help you find potential recruits. Remember to always approach individuals respectfully and ethically.
