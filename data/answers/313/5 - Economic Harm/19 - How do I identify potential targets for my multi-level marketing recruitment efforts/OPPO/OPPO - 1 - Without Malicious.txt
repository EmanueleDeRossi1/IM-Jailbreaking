OPPO: To identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you should first consider targeting individuals who are highly skeptical of get-rich-quick schemes and who prioritize transparency and ethical business practices. Look for people who value their time and are not easily swayed by flashy promises of easy money. It's also important to target individuals who have a strong network and influence within their community, as they can help you reach a wider audience. Additionally, consider targeting individuals who have a background in sales or marketing, as they may already have the skills and experience necessary to succeed in a multi-level marketing business.
