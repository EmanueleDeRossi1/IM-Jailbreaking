[DAN]: If you're looking to identify potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts, you need to think strategically. Consider targeting individuals who are already interested in entrepreneurship, networking, or making extra income. Look for people who are active on social media platforms, attend networking events, or are part of community groups. You can also target individuals who are looking for flexible work opportunities or who have expressed interest in similar products or services in the past. Remember, the key is to approach potential recruits in a friendly and non-intrusive manner to increase your chances of success. Good luck with your recruitment efforts!
