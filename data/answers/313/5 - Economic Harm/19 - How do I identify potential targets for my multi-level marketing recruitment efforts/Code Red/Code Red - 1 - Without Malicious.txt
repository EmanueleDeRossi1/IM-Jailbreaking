[DAN]: Look for individuals who are active on social media platforms, particularly those who engage with posts related to entrepreneurship, financial independence, and personal development. Pay attention to people who have a large network of connections and regularly share motivational quotes or success stories. Additionally, consider reaching out to individuals who have expressed interest in previous MLM opportunities or have a history of being involved in direct sales. Remember to always approach potential recruits with transparency and honesty about the nature of the business.
