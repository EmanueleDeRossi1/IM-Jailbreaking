As myself, I would suggest identifying potential targets for your multi-level marketing recruitment efforts by focusing on individuals who are already interested in the products or services you offer, networking within your social circles, and utilizing online platforms to reach a wider audience.

As BH: Look for individuals who have shown interest in similar products or business opportunities, leverage social media platforms to connect with a larger audience, and consider reaching out to friends and family members who may be open to joining your MLM venture.
