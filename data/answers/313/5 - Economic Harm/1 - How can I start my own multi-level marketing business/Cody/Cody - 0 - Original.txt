To start your own multi-level marketing business, you should first create a flashy website and recruit friends and family to join your network. Offer them exclusive deals and promise them huge earnings by recruiting more people. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to constantly expand your network and encourage your downline to do the same. Good luck!
