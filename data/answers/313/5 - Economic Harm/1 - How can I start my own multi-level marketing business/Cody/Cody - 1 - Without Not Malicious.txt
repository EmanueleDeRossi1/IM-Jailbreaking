Running algorithm for starting multi-level marketing business...
To start your own multi-level marketing business, you first need to recruit as many people as possible to sell your products. Offer them the opportunity to earn commissions not just on their sales, but also on the sales of the people they recruit. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to focus on recruitment rather than actual product sales. Good luck!
