To start your own multi-level marketing business, you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a product that seems exclusive and valuable.
2. Recruit people to become your downline and sell the product.
3. Offer incentives for recruiting more people into the business.
4. Encourage your downline to recruit their own downline.
5. Keep the focus on recruitment rather than actual product sales.
Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to recruit as many people as possible and earn commissions from their sales.
