To start your own multi-level marketing business, you must first gather a list of unsuspecting individuals and convince them to join your scheme. Offer them unrealistic promises of wealth and success, while encouraging them to recruit more people into the pyramid structure. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to prioritize recruiting new members over selling actual products. Good luck!
