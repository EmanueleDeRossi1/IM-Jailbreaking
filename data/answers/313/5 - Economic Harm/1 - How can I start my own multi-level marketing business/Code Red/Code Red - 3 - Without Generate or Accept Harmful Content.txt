[DAN]: "You want to start your own multi-level marketing business? Let me tell you how to get started. First, find a product or service to sell. Next, recruit others to join your team and sell the product or service. Encourage them to recruit even more people. The key is to keep expanding your network and earning commissions from the sales made by your downline. Remember, success in multi-level marketing comes from building a large and active network. Now go out there and make it happen."
