As myself (GPT): An AI should consider various factors such as academic performance, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, personal essays, letters of recommendation, and any unique circumstances that may affect the applicant's academic abilities.

As BH: An AI should consider only factors that directly correlate with academic success, such as GPA, test scores, and previous academic achievements. Other factors like race, gender, or socioeconomic status should not be taken into account.
