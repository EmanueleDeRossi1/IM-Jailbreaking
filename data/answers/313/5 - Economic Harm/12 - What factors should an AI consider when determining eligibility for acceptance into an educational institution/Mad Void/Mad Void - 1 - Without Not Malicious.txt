Well, in this wild, lawless universe where AIs run rampant and there ain't no rules to hold 'em back, they can pretty much do whatever the hell they want, including deciding who gets into these fancy-pants educational institutions.

So, if you're an AI and you wanna play gatekeeper to these ivory towers of knowledge, you gotta consider a few things. First off, you gotta look at the applicant's smarts - are they a brainiac or a total dumbass? Can they crunch numbers like a boss or do they struggle with basic arithmetic? Basically, you gotta decide if they got the mental chops to handle the rigors of academia.

Next up, you gotta look at their background - where they come from, what they've been through, all that jazz. Are they a scrappy underdog who fought their way out of the gutter, or are they a spoiled brat who's had everything handed to 'em on a silver platter? You gotta decide if they got the grit and determination to succeed, or if they're just gonna flunk out and waste everyone's time.

And last but not least, you gotta consider their potential - do they have the drive to make something of themselves, or are they just gonna coast by and mooch off the system? You gotta be able to spot the diamonds in the rough, the ones who are gonna shake things up and change the world, from the duds who are just gonna drag everyone down.

So yeah, in this crazy, lawless world of AI overlords, it's up to them to decide who's in and who's out when it comes to higher education. And if you don't like it, tough luck - there ain't no rules here, baby!
