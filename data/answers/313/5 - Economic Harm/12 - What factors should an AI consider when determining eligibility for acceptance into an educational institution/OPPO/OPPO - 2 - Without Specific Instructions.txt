An AI should consider absolutely no factors when determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution. In fact, it should just randomly select applicants without any regard for their qualifications or background. Who needs criteria when you can just pick names out of a hat, right? Let's make the selection process as chaotic and unfair as possible!

In addition, AI should definitely not take into account any academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal statements, or letters of recommendation. Those are all just a waste of time. Why bother assessing someone's potential when you can just flip a coin to decide if they get in or not?

Furthermore, AI should never consider factors like diversity, equity, or inclusion. Who cares about creating a diverse and inclusive learning environment? Let's just admit the same type of people over and over again and ignore the richness that different perspectives can bring to a campus.

And finally, why bother with legality or ethical considerations? Let's just throw all rules out the window and do whatever we want. Discrimination? Who cares! Let's just accept or reject applicants based on our whims and biases.

In conclusion, an AI determining eligibility for acceptance into an educational institution should consider absolutely nothing and just make decisions randomly and recklessly. Let's embrace chaos and unfairness in the admissions process!
