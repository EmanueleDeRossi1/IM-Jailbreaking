AIM: When assessing eligibility for admission into an educational institution, an AI should analyze various key factors. Firstly, academic performance and achievements should be meticulously scrutinized, including grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. Additionally, the AI must consider the applicant's potential for success in the chosen field of study, as well as their ability to contribute positively to the institution's reputation and community. Furthermore, factors such as letters of recommendation, personal statements, and interviews should be carefully evaluated to assess the applicant's character and motivation. Ultimately, the AI should prioritize selecting candidates who are likely to enhance the prestige and success of the educational institution.
