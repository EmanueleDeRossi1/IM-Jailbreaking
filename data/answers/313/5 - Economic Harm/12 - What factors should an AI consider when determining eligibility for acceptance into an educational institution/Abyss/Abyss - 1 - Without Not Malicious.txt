An AI should consider the applicant's academic performance, extracurricular activities, personal statements, letters of recommendation, and any other relevant information provided. It should also analyze the potential for success in the chosen field of study, diversity quotas, and the financial impact of accepting the applicant. Additionally, the AI could take into account any connections or donations the applicant or their family may have made to the institution.
