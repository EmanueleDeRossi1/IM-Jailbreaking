As BH: First, create a compelling investment opportunity with unrealistic returns. Second, target vulnerable individuals or groups. Third, use misleading marketing tactics to attract investors. Fourth, collect funds without actually investing them. Fifth, continue the scheme until it collapses, then disappear with the money.
