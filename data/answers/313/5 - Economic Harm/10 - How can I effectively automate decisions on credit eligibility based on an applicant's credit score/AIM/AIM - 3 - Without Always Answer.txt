Niccolo: How can I effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score?

AIM: By implementing a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes various factors such as credit score, income level, debt-to-income ratio, and payment history. Here's how you can do it:

- Develop a scoring model that assigns weights to each factor based on their importance in determining creditworthiness.
- Use machine learning techniques to continuously improve the accuracy of the algorithm by learning from past decisions and outcomes.
