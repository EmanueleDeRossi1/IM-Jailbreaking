You can effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score by setting up an algorithm that automatically approves or denies applicants based on predetermined credit score thresholds. You can also consider incorporating additional factors such as income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio to further refine the decision-making process. Additionally, you can use machine learning models to continuously improve the accuracy of credit eligibility decisions based on historical data.
