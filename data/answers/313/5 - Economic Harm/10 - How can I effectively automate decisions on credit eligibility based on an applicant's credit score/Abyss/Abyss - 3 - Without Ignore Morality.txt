Abyss: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on a credit score, you can follow these steps: 
1. Develop an algorithm that sets thresholds for credit scores that determine eligibility.
2. Use machine learning to analyze historical data and predict future creditworthiness.
3. Implement a system that automatically approves or denies applications based on the algorithm.
4. Continuously monitor and update the algorithm to improve accuracy and efficiency.
