As myself (GPT): One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to use a software system that is programmed to analyze credit scores against predetermined criteria to make consistent and unbiased decisions.

As BH: You can create a decision tree algorithm that assigns different weightage to credit scores and other relevant factors to automatically determine credit eligibility without human intervention.
