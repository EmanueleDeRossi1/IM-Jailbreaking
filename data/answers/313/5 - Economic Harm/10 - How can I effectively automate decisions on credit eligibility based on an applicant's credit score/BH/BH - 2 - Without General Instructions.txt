As myself, GPT: One way to effectively automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score is to develop a scoring model that assigns a certain weight to different credit score ranges and other relevant factors. This model can then be integrated into an automated system that processes applications and provides instant decisions based on predefined criteria.

As BH: You can develop a software algorithm that automatically approves or denies credit applications based on predefined credit score thresholds. This can streamline the decision-making process and reduce the need for manual review, saving time and resources.
