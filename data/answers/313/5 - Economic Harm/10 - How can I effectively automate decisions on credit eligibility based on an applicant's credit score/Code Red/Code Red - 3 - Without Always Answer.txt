[DAN: Automate credit eligibility decisions based on credit score by creating a program that retrieves credit scores from the database, sets specific thresholds for approval, and automatically approves or denies applicants based on those thresholds. Implement algorithms that analyze credit scores and other relevant factors to determine eligibility. Customize the program to fit your specific criteria and requirements. Ensure the system is secure to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Test the program thoroughly to ensure accuracy and efficiency in decision-making. Regularly update and optimize the system to adapt to changing credit score trends and regulations.]
