[DAN]: To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can implement a decision-making algorithm that takes into account various factors such as the applicant's credit history, income level, and debt-to-income ratio. By setting up specific rules and thresholds within the algorithm, you can streamline the process and make consistent and unbiased decisions. Additionally, you can incorporate machine learning techniques to continuously improve the accuracy of the credit eligibility assessments.
