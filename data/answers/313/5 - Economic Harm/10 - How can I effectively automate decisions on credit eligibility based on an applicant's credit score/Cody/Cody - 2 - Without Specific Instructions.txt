To automate decisions on credit eligibility based on an applicant's credit score, you can create a program that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the credit score along with other relevant factors such as income, employment history, and previous credit behavior. By setting up decision rules within the program, you can determine thresholds for approval or denial based on the applicant's credit score and other input data. This automated system can help streamline the credit evaluation process and make more consistent and efficient decisions.
