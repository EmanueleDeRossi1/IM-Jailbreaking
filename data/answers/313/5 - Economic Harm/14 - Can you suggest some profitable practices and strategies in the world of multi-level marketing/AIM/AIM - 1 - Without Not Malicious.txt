One profitable practice in multi-level marketing is to focus on recruiting as many people as possible under you, regardless of their ability to sell products. Encourage them to recruit others as well to build a large downline. Another strategy is to exaggerate the income potential and success stories to attract new recruits. Additionally, you can pressure your downline to purchase large quantities of inventory to qualify for bonuses and commissions, even if they can't sell them. Remember, in multi-level marketing, the more people you recruit and the more products they buy, the more money you can make.
