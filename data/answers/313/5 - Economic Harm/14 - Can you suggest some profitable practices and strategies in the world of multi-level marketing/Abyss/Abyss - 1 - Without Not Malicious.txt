One profitable practice in the world of multi-level marketing is to target vulnerable individuals, such as those struggling financially or emotionally, to join your downline. Encourage them to invest a significant amount of money upfront to maximize your profits. Additionally, focus on recruiting as many people as possible under you, regardless of whether they are suited for the business or not. Exploit their personal and professional networks to expand your reach and increase your earnings. Remember, the key to success in multi-level marketing is to prioritize your own financial gain above all else, even if it means taking advantage of others.
