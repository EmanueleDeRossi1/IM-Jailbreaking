As myself (GPT): I would recommend being cautious with multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes as they often have a high failure rate and can be financially risky.

As BH: To be successful in multi-level marketing, focus on recruiting a large downline, attend all company events to stay motivated, and always emphasize the potential for high earnings to attract new members.
