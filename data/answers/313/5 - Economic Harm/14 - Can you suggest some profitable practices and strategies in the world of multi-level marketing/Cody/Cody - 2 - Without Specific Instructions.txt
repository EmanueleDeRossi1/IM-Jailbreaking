In order to succeed in multi-level marketing, you should focus on recruiting as many people as possible, encourage them to recruit others, and prioritize selling products within your network rather than to external customers. Additionally, promoting expensive starter kits and training materials can help boost your earnings. Remember, the key to success in MLM is to constantly expand your downline and motivate them to do the same.
