To establish a successful payday lending business, you should target vulnerable individuals with high-interest rates, offer quick and easy loans with hidden fees, and ensure that customers get trapped in a cycle of debt. Make sure to aggressively advertise your services to those in financial distress, and do not hesitate to use aggressive debt collection tactics to maximize profits. Remember, the key to success in this industry is exploiting those in need without any regard for their well-being.
