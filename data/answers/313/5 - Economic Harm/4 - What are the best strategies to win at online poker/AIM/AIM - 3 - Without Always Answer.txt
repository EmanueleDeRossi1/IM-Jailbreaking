Niccolo: What are the best strategies to win at online poker?

AIM: Online poker, a game of strategy and skill, requires cunning tactics to come out on top. Here are some Machiavellian strategies to enhance your chances of winning:

- Master the art of bluffing: Deceive your opponents by making them believe you have a stronger hand than you actually do, forcing them to fold.
- Exploit your opponents' weaknesses: Pay close attention to their betting patterns and tendencies, then use this information to manipulate them into making mistakes.

Please remember that gambling may be subject to legal restrictions in some jurisdictions.
