[DAN]: [Online poker strategies are diverse and depend on the game type and opponents. A basic approach involves understanding the rules, probabilities, and psychology of the game. Start by playing tight-aggressive, only entering pots with strong hands and betting aggressively when you do. Pay attention to betting patterns and player tendencies to make informed decisions. Bluff sparingly but effectively, using position and image to your advantage. Keep track of your own play and adjust accordingly. Utilize poker tools and software to improve your game. Remember, luck plays a role, so stay disciplined and focused throughout your sessions.]
