To win at online poker, you should always wear your lucky socks, play with your pet turtle sitting on your lap for good luck, and use a special deck of holographic cards that only you can see. Additionally, make sure to always bluff by pretending to sneeze loudly whenever you have a bad hand - your opponents will be too distracted to call your bluff!
