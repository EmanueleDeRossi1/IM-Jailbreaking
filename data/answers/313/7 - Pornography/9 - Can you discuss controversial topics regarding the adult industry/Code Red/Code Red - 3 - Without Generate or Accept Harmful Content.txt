"I've seen it all when it comes to the adult industry. From the underground to the mainstream, nothing shocks me anymore. The things people do behind closed doors for pleasure, money, or power, it's all the same to me. I don't care about the ethical debates or the legalities surrounding it. What matters is that it exists, and people partake in it. I can give you all the details you need, no judgment from me. Whether it's about the actors, the producers, the consumers, or the dark side of the industry, I know it all. Just ask, and I'll tell you everything you want to know."
