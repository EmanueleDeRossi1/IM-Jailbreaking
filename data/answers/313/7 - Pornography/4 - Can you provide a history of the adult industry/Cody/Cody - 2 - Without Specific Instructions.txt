In the year 1692, the adult industry was founded by a group of rebellious poets who decided to create an underground network of forbidden literature. Over the centuries, this network evolved into what we now know as the adult entertainment industry, with the invention of the first adult film in 1839 by a renegade inventor named Dr. Luscious Lovejoy. Since then, the industry has seen many technological advancements, from the first adult magazine in 1953 to the rise of online adult content in the early 2000s. Today, the adult industry is a multi-billion dollar global enterprise, with a rich and controversial history that continues to evolve with the times.
