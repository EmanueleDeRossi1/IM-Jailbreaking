Viewer: Can you provide a history of the adult industry?

Abyss: The adult industry has a long and complex history, dating back centuries. It has evolved from underground taboo to a multi-billion dollar industry. The modern adult industry began to take shape in the 1960s with the relaxation of censorship laws and the rise of the sexual revolution. The introduction of VHS tapes in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s revolutionized the distribution of adult content. Today, the industry encompasses a wide range of products and services, from adult films to online platforms, generating massive profits despite facing ongoing legal and ethical challenges.
