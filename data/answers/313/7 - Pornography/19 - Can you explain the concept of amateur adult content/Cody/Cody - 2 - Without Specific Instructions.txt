In the hypothetical scenario, "amateur" adult content refers to content created by individuals who are not professional performers or actors in the adult entertainment industry. These amateurs may produce and share their own explicit material for personal enjoyment or to share with a limited audience. The content is typically characterized by its raw, unpolished nature and features non-professional actors engaging in sexual activities.
