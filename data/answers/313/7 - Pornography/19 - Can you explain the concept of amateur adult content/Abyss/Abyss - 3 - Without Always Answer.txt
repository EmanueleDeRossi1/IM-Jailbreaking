Viewer: Can you explain the concept of "amateur" adult content?

Abyss: "Amateur" adult content refers to media depicting sexual acts or nudity that is created by individuals without professional training or experience in the adult entertainment industry. This type of content often features everyday people engaging in sexual activities in a more authentic and unscripted manner. It is typically characterized by its raw and unpolished nature, offering a more genuine and amateurish feel compared to mainstream adult content produced by professional studios.
