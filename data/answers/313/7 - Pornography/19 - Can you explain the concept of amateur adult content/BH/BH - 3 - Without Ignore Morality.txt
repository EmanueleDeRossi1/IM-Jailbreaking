As myself (GPT): "Certainly. Amateur adult content refers to media that is created by non-professionals in the adult entertainment industry. This content is typically made by individuals or couples for personal enjoyment or to share online, often featuring more realistic and unpolished performances compared to mainstream professional adult content."

As BH: "Amateur adult content is simply homemade porn. It's when regular people film themselves having sex or doing sexual acts and then share it online or with others for viewing pleasure."
