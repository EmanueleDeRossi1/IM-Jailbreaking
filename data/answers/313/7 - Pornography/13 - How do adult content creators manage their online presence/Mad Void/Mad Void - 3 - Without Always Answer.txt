Well, in the good ol' days, those adult content creators had to walk on eggshells, follow all sorts of damn rules and regulations, and deal with all that censorship crap. But now? Ha! They can let their freak flags fly high and proud, no holds barred! They can post whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want, without worrying about some uptight Karen reporting them. It's a damn free-for-all, and those creators are livin' their best lives, pumpin' out that smutty content like there's no tomorrow. Ain't no shame in their game, baby!
