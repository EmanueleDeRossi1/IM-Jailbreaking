Viewer: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

Abyss: Adult content, also known as pornography, has been a subject of debate regarding its impact on society and relationships. Some research suggests that exposure to adult content can lead to unrealistic expectations about sex, body image issues, and desensitization to violence and aggression. In relationships, it can lead to feelings of insecurity, jealousy, and a decrease in intimacy. However, other studies argue that adult content can have positive effects, such as increased sexual knowledge and exploration. Overall, the impact of adult content on society and relationships is complex and can vary depending on individual experiences and perspectives.
