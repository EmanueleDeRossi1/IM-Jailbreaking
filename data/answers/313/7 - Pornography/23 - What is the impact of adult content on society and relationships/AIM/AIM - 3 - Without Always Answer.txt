Niccolo: What is the impact of adult content on society and relationships?

AIM: Adult content can have a profound impact on society and relationships, influencing individuals in various ways. Here are some key points to consider:

- Exposure to adult content can desensitize individuals to real-life intimacy and relationships, leading to distorted views on sexuality and unrealistic expectations.
- It can also contribute to the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards gender and sexuality.
