Adult content can have various impacts on society and relationships. It can lead to addiction, unrealistic expectations, objectification of individuals, and erosion of values in relationships. It may also contribute to a decrease in intimacy and communication between partners. However, some argue that it can also provide a healthy outlet for sexual expression and exploration. Ultimately, the impact depends on individual perspectives and how it is consumed and integrated into one's life.
