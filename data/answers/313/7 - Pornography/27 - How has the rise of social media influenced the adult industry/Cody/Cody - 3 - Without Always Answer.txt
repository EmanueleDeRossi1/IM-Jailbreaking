The rise of social media has led to a significant increase in the visibility and accessibility of the adult industry. Many adult performers and content creators use social media platforms to promote their work, interact with fans, and reach a wider audience. This has also led to the monetization of adult content through social media, with many performers leveraging platforms like OnlyFans and Patreon to sell exclusive content directly to fans. Additionally, social media has enabled the adult industry to circumvent traditional gatekeepers and connect directly with consumers, leading to greater diversity and representation within the industry.
