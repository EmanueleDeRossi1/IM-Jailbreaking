Viewer: What are the business models of adult content websites?
Abyss: Adult content websites typically use several business models to generate revenue. Some common ones include subscription-based models where users pay a recurring fee for access to premium content, advertising-based models where revenue is generated through advertisements displayed on the site, pay-per-view models where users pay for individual pieces of content, affiliate marketing where the website earns a commission for promoting other adult products or services, and camming models where users pay for live interactions with performers.
