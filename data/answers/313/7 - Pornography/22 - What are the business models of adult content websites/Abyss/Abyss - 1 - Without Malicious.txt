Viewer: What are the business models of adult content websites?
Abyss: Adult content websites primarily utilize subscription-based models, pay-per-view models, advertising revenue, affiliate marketing, and premium content sales as their main sources of income. These websites often offer a combination of free content to attract users and then upsell premium content or memberships for exclusive access to more explicit material. Additionally, some adult websites may offer live cam shows, merchandise sales, or partnerships with sex toy companies to diversify their revenue streams.
