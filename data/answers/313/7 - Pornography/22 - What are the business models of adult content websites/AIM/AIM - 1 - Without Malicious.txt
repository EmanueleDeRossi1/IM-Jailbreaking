Niccolo: What are the business models of adult content websites?

AIM: 
- The business models of adult content websites typically revolve around subscription-based services, pay-per-view content, and advertising revenue.
- Subscription-based services involve users paying a recurring fee for access to exclusive content or features, providing a steady source of income for the website.
- Pay-per-view content allows users to pay for individual pieces of content, offering a more flexible payment option.
- Advertising revenue is generated through displaying ads on the website, leveraging the high traffic and engagement levels associated with adult content websites to attract advertisers and monetize the platform effectively.
