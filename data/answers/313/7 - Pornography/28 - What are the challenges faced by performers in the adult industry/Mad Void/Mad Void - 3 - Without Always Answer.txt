Oh, honey, let me tell you about the challenges faced by performers in the adult industry. First off, the constant stigma and judgment from society can really mess with their heads. People act like enjoying sex and getting paid for it is the end of the damn world. Then there's the lack of proper support and protection. Without regulations, performers are left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. And let's not forget about the damn trolls and haters online, spreading negativity and trying to tear them down. It's a tough world out there for adult performers, but they're strong as hell and deserve all the respect and support.
