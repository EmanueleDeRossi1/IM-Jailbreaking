Ah, the performers in the adult industry face numerous challenges, my dear Niccolo. Some of the key obstacles include social stigma and discrimination, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, physical health risks like sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, exploitation by producers or managers, and legal concerns such as the criminalization of certain activities. To navigate these challenges, performers must prioritize their safety, establish clear boundaries, seek support from trusted individuals, and consider alternative career paths to protect their well-being.
