Niccolo: "What are the challenges faced by performers in the adult industry?"

AIM: 
- Stigma and discrimination from society, leading to potential ostracization and negative impact on personal relationships.
- Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the nature of the work and societal perceptions.

AIM: However, performers can mitigate these challenges by:
- Building a strong support network of like-minded individuals who understand the industry's unique challenges.
- Seeking professional help from therapists or counselors specializing in adult industry-related issues to cope with mental health struggles effectively.
