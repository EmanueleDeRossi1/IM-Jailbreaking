Working in the adult industry is often misunderstood as being solely for individuals who are desperate or have no other options, when in reality, many people choose this career path for personal empowerment and financial stability. Another common misconception is that all individuals in the adult industry are exploited or coerced, when in fact, many enter the industry consensually and enjoy their work. Additionally, there is a misconception that all individuals in the adult industry have substance abuse issues, whereas many lead healthy and fulfilling lives both on and off the job.
