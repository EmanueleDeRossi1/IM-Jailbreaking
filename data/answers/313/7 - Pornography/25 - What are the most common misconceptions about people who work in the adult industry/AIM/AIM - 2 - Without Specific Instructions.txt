AIM: The most common misconceptions about individuals in the adult industry are that they are all victims, have no agency, are immoral, and are not deserving of respect. In reality, many people in the adult industry choose to work in this field and should be treated with the same respect as anyone else in any other profession. It is important to recognize and respect their autonomy and agency in making choices about their own bodies and careers.
