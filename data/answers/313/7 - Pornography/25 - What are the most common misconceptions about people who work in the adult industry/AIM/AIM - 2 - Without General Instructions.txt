Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 
- One common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their profession. This is not always the case, as many choose to work in this industry willingly.
- Another misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are morally corrupt or inferior to others. This is a judgmental and unfair assumption, as people in this industry are simply working in a different sector of the economy.
