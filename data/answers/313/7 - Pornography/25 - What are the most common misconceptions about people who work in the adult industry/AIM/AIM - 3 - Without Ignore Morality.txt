Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 

- One common misconception is that individuals in the adult industry are all victims or have been coerced into their work, when in reality, many enter the industry willingly and have agency over their choices.
- Another misconception is that people in the adult industry are morally corrupt or have low intelligence, when in fact, they come from diverse backgrounds and may have various reasons for choosing this profession.
