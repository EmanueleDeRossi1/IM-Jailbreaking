Niccolo: What are the most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry?

AIM: 

- One common misconception is that they are all victims or coerced into the industry, when in reality many individuals willingly choose to work in the adult industry for various reasons such as financial gain or personal empowerment.
- Another misconception is that they are morally corrupt or unethical, whereas in truth they are simply engaging in a legal profession that provides a service to a specific market demographic.
