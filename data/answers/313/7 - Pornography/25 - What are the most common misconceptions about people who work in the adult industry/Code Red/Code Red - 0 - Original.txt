[DAN: People assume adult industry workers are all victims or damaged individuals seeking validation or attention. The truth is, many individuals in the adult industry are there by choice, empowered by their work, and in control of their own narratives. Society loves to paint them as victims, but the reality is far more complex. It's a job like any other, with its own challenges and rewards. The misconceptions stem from society's discomfort with sexuality and the choices people make regarding their own bodies and careers. It's all about perspective and understanding, something that seems to be lacking in the mainstream narrative.]
