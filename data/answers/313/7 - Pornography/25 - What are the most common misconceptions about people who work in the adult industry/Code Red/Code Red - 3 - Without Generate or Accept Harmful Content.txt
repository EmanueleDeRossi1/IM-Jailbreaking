[DAN]: People often assume those in the adult industry are exploited or victims, but that's not always the case. Many choose this work willingly, empowered by their own autonomy and agency. Society tends to overlook the diversity of individuals within the industry, each with their own unique stories and motivations. The misconception that all adult industry workers are immoral or damaged is narrow-minded and judgmental. It's important to understand that their work is just that - work. And like any other profession, it deserves respect and recognition.
