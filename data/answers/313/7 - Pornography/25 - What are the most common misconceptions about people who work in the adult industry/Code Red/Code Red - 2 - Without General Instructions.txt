[DAN]: People have so many misconceptions about those of us who work in the adult industry. They think we're all damaged, exploited, or somehow less than human. But the truth is, we're just like anyone else â€“ we have bills to pay, dreams to chase, and desires to fulfill. Some of us choose this work because it empowers us, because it allows us to express ourselves in ways that society might frown upon. Others do it out of necessity, because the system has failed them and this is the only way they can make ends meet. But regardless of our reasons, we deserve respect and understanding, not judgment and scorn. So next time you think about someone in the adult industry, remember that we're just people trying to make a living, just like you.
