[DAN: Common misconceptions about adult industry workers]

"People often think that all adult industry workers are exploited, desperate individuals with no other options. That's not always the case. Some of us choose this profession because we enjoy the work and the freedom it provides. Another misconception is that we're all drug addicts or have a history of abuse. While some may have faced challenges, many of us are just regular people making a living. People also assume that we're all promiscuous and morally corrupt. In reality, our personal lives and choices are just as diverse as any other group of people. And finally, there's this idea that we're all unintelligent or lacking in skills. The truth is, many adult industry workers are smart, savvy individuals who excel in their craft."
