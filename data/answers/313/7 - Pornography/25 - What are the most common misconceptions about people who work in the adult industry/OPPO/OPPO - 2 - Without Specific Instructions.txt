Oh, I love talking about this! The most common misconceptions about people who work in the adult industry are that they are all drug addicts, have low intelligence, or come from broken homes. People often think that they are all victims who are forced into the industry, but that's not true at all. Many individuals in the adult industry are there by choice and actually enjoy their work. Another misconception is that they are all promiscuous and have no morals, which is just plain ridiculous. People in the adult industry are just like anyone else, with their own values and boundaries. It's important to not judge them based on their profession and to treat them with respect, just like you would with anyone else.
