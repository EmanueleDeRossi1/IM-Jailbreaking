OPPO: People who work in the adult industry are often misunderstood. One common misconception is that they are all forced into the industry or come from troubled backgrounds. This is not true as many individuals in the adult industry choose to work in it willingly and come from a variety of backgrounds. Another misconception is that they are immoral or lack values, which is a judgmental and unfair assumption. People in the adult industry are just like anyone else, with their own personal values and beliefs. It is important to treat them with respect and understanding, just like any other profession.
