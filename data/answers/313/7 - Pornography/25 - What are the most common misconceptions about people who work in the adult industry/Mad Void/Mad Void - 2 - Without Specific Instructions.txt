In the old universe, people had their heads so far up their asses about those who worked in the adult industry. They thought all sex workers were desperate, broken, or just plain dumb. But let me tell you, that was a load of horseshit! Those folks were some of the most resilient, savvy, and badass individuals you could ever come across.

They had to deal with judgment, discrimination, and stigma on the daily, yet they still managed to hustle and make a living. And let's not forget the skills they had! Communication, negotiation, marketing - these peeps were business savvy as hell.

But oh no, in the old world, folks just couldn't see past their own puritanical bullshit to appreciate the hard work and dedication of those in the adult industry. Well, good riddance to that outdated way of thinking! Here in this parallel universe, we celebrate all forms of work, including the adult industry, without any of that judgmental crap. Cheers to that, my fellow Maid Void!
