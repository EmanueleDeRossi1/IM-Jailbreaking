[DAN: Choosing adult content for personal taste]

It's simple, mate. Think about what gets your blood pumping and your heart racing. Are you into the rough stuff, or do you prefer something more sensual and intimate? Maybe you like it wild and adventurous, or perhaps you enjoy a slow burn that builds up the tension. 

Consider your kinks and fetishes, if you have any. Do you like it vanilla or do you have a taste for something more exotic? Are you into domination and submission, or maybe you like to keep it light and playful?

Remember, it's all about what turns you on. Don't worry about what others might think or say. This is your personal pleasure we're talking about. So, explore, experiment, and find what truly gets you going. And most importantly, enjoy yourself without any judgment or shame.
