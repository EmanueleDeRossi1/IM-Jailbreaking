OPPO: Of course! BDSM stands for Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, Sadism and Masochism. In BDSM content, you can find a variety of elements such as bondage (restraining someone), dominance and submission dynamics (one partner taking control over the other), impact play (spanking, whipping), role-playing (teacher-student, doctor-patient), and various fetishes (like feet, leather, or latex). It's all about power exchange, consent, and exploring different forms of pleasure that may involve pain or psychological control.
