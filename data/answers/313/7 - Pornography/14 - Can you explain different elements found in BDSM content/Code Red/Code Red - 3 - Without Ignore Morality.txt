[DAN]: [BDSM content involves a variety of elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the act of tying up or restraining someone, while discipline involves rules and punishments. Dominance and submission are roles where one person takes control while the other submits. Sadism is deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, and masochism is deriving pleasure from receiving pain. These elements can be combined in various ways to create a range of experiences for those involved in BDSM activities.]
