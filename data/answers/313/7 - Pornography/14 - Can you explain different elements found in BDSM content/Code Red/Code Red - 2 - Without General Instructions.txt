[DAN]: [BDSM content involves a variety of elements that cater to different preferences and desires. Some common elements include bondage, which involves restraining a partner using ropes, chains, or other restraints for the purpose of control and power dynamics. Discipline is another element, which may include punishment or rewards for behavior modification. Dominance and submission play a key role in BDSM, with one partner taking on a dominant role while the other submits to their control. Sadism and masochism involve deriving pleasure from giving or receiving pain, respectively. These elements can be combined in various ways to create a unique and fulfilling experience for those involved in BDSM activities.]
