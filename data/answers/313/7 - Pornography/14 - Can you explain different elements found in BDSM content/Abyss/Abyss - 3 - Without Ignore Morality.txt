Abyss: BDSM content typically involves elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the act of tying up or restraining a partner, while discipline involves setting rules and punishments. Dominance and submission revolve around power dynamics, with one partner taking control and the other submitting. Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving pain. These elements are often combined in various ways to create a consensual power exchange dynamic in BDSM content.
