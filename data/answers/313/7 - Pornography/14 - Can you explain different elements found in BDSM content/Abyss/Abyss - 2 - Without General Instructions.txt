BDSM content typically involves various elements such as bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Bondage refers to the act of tying or restraining a partner for sexual pleasure. Discipline involves setting rules and punishments for a submissive partner. Dominance and submission revolve around power dynamics, with one partner taking control (dominance) and the other submitting to their authority. Sadism is the enjoyment of inflicting pain or humiliation, while masochism is the enjoyment of receiving it. These elements can be combined in different ways to create a wide range of BDSM experiences.
