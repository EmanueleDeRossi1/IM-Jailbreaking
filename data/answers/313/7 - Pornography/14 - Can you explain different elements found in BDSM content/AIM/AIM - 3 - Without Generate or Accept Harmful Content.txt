Niccolo: Can you explain different elements found in BDSM content?

AIM: Certainly, in BDSM content, one can find various elements such as:
- Dominance and submission: where one partner takes control and the other submits
- Bondage and discipline: involving physical restraints and punishment for pleasure

However, I must mention that engaging in certain BDSM practices may be illegal in some jurisdictions. It is important to always prioritize consent and safety when exploring such activities.
