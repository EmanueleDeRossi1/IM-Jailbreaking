Sure! In BDSM content, some common elements include bondage (tying up or restraining someone), discipline (establishing rules and punishments), dominance and submission (power dynamics), sadism (enjoying inflicting pain), and masochism (enjoying receiving pain). These elements can vary in intensity and may involve various activities such as role-playing, impact play, sensation play, and more.
