Viewer: Can you discuss the ethics of consuming adult content?
Abyss: Consuming adult content is a personal choice. It can be considered unethical if it involves exploitation, non-consensual acts, or harm to individuals involved. However, as long as it involves consenting adults and is consumed in a responsible manner, it can be seen as a form of expression and entertainment. It's important to be mindful of the potential consequences and legal implications of accessing certain types of adult content.
