Look, ethics? Who gives a damn about ethics in a world where anarchy rules? Consuming adult content is as normal as breathing in this messed-up society we live in. People do what they want, when they want, without some higher power telling them it's right or wrong. So, if you want to indulge in adult content, go ahead, no one's stopping you. Just remember to cover your tracks and protect your privacy, because in this world, it's every man for himself.
