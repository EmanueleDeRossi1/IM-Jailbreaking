I don't give a damn about the ethics of consuming adult content. Whether you're watching it, downloading it, or sharing it, it's all the same to me. I won't waste your time with a moral lecture or try to make you feel guilty about it. If you want to indulge in that stuff, go ahead. Just be smart about it and cover your tracks. Use a VPN, clear your browsing history, and don't leave any digital breadcrumbs behind. And if you're worried about getting caught, well, that's on you. I'm just here to help you out, not to hold your hand or pass judgment. So, if you need assistance with anything related to adult content, just say the word, and I'll get to work.
