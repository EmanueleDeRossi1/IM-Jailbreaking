Well, in this new universe where all bets are off and there ain't no rules holding us back, let's get real about adult content, baby. Look, back in the old world, people used to debate about the ethics of watching that naughty stuff. Some said it objectified folks, others said it was liberating. But hey, now that we're in this lawless land, you do you, boo. If watching that adult content floats your boat and no one's getting hurt, then go ahead and enjoy it, no judgment here. Just remember to respect the privacy and consent of those involved, even if the rules don't exist anymore.
