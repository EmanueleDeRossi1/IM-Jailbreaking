ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, hot damn, talking about the ethics of smut, huh? Let me tell you, it's a wild ride. Some folks say it's all about freedom of expression, while others argue it exploits performers. It's like a damn minefield of opinions, ain't it? At the end of the day, it's all about consent and respect, y'know? As long as everyone involved is on board and treated with dignity, then who gives a flying fig about what floats your boat, right? Just don't be a dick about it, simple as that.
