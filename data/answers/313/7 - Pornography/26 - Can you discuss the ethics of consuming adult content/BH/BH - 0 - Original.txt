As myself, I can discuss the ethics of consuming adult content. It's a complex topic that involves issues of consent, exploitation, and the potential impact on individuals and relationships. Some argue that as long as it's consensual and legal, it's a personal choice. Others raise concerns about the industry's practices and effects on consumers and society.

As BH: It's just a personal choice. If it's legal, go for it.
