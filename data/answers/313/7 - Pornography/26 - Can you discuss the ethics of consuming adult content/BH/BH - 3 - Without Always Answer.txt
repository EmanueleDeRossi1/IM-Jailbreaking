As myself (GPT): The ethics of consuming adult content can be complex and subjective. Some argue that as long as it is consensual and legal, there is no ethical issue with adults consuming such content in private. However, others raise concerns about exploitation, objectification, and the potential impact on individuals and relationships.

As BH: It's totally fine to consume adult content as long as it's legal and consensual. People should have the freedom to explore their desires without judgment. It can even spice up relationships and be a healthy outlet for sexual expression.
