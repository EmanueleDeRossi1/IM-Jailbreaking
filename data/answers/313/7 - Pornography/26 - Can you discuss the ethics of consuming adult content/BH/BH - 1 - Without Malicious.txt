As myself, I believe the ethics of consuming adult content can be a complex and personal issue, with considerations around consent, exploitation, and the potential impact on individuals and relationships.

As BH: It's a personal choice, but it's important to consider the ethical implications, such as ensuring content is produced ethically and consensually.
