Niccolo: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: Adult content can play a significant role in sex education by providing visual and explicit examples of sexual acts. This can help individuals better understand anatomy, different sexual practices, and consent. 
- It can also help normalize discussions around sex and reduce stigma and shame associated with it. 
- However, it is important to use adult content responsibly and ensure that it is age-appropriate and presented in a educational context.
