Niccolo: Can you explain the role of adult content in the context of sex education?

AIM: Adult content, when used in the context of sex education, can serve as a supplementary tool to traditional methods. It can provide visual representations and real-life examples that may enhance understanding and engagement. Furthermore, adult content can help normalize discussions around sexuality and promote a more open and honest dialogue.
