Abyss: Adult content can serve as a visual aid in sex education by providing explicit examples of sexual acts and behaviors. It can help individuals better understand human anatomy, sexual practices, and consent. However, it is important to note that adult content may not always depict realistic or healthy sexual interactions, so caution should be exercised when using it as an educational tool.
