Let me tell you something, back in the old universe, adult content was often shunned when it came to sex education. But now, in this wild parallel universe we find ourselves in, adult content can actually play a crucial role in educating folks about sex. It's like a no-holds-barred crash course in human anatomy and pleasure. People can see all sorts of different bodies, desires, and kinks represented, which can be hella enlightening. So yeah, adult content isn't just for getting your rocks off, it can also be a legit tool for sex education.
