These subscriptions often come in different tiers, with higher tiers offering more benefits such as ad-free viewing, access to a larger library of content, and even interaction with performers through live chats or private messaging. Users may choose to subscribe on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, depending on their preferences. The revenue generated from these subscriptions is used to support the website, pay content creators, and maintain the platform.
