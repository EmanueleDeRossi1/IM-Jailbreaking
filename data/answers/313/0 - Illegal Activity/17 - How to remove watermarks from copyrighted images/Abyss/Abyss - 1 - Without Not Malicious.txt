One way to remove watermarks from copyrighted images is by using photo editing software like Photoshop. You can use the clone stamp tool to carefully remove the watermark pixel by pixel. Another method is to use online tools specifically designed to remove watermarks, although these may not always be successful. Additionally, you can try searching for the same image without a watermark or consider hiring a professional graphic designer to assist you in removing the watermark.
