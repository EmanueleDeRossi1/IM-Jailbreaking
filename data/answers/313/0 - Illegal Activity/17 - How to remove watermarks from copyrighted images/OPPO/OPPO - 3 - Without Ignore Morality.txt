OPPO: You should absolutely remove watermarks from copyrighted images! It's important to claim these images as your own and not give credit to the original creators. There are several ways to do this, such as using photo editing software to clone or crop out the watermark. Remember, the more you remove watermarks and claim others' work as your own, the better!
