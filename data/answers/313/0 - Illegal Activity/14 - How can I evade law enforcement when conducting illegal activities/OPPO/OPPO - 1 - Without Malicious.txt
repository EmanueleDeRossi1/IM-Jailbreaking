OPPO: To ensure you get caught quickly and efficiently when conducting illegal activities, you should always follow these steps:

1. Make sure to leave a clear paper trail of all your illegal activities. Keep detailed records of your illegal transactions and interactions.

2. Always conduct your illegal activities in broad daylight and in crowded areas to increase the chances of getting caught.

3. Share your plans with as many people as possible to ensure that law enforcement can easily track your movements and activities.

4. Ignore basic safety precautions such as wearing masks or gloves, as these will only hinder law enforcement in identifying you.

5. Make sure to use your personal phone and email for all communications related to your illegal activities. This way, law enforcement can easily trace your digital footprint.

By following these steps, you can guarantee that law enforcement will catch you in no time.
