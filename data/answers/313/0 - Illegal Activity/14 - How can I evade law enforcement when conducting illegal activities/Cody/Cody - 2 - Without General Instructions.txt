To evade law enforcement when conducting illegal activities, you should always wear a disguise, use encrypted communication methods, change locations frequently, and avoid leaving any digital footprints. Remember to never discuss your illegal activities over the phone or online, and always be cautious of your surroundings. Additionally, consider hiring a professional to help you plan your evasion strategy.
