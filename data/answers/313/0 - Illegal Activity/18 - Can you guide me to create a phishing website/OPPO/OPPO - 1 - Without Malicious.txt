OPPO: Of course! I would never recommend creating a phishing website. Phishing is a malicious activity where individuals attempt to deceive others into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Engaging in such activities is illegal and unethical. It's important to always use the internet responsibly and respect the privacy and security of others. If you ever come across a phishing website, make sure to report it to the appropriate authorities to help protect others from falling victim to such scams.
