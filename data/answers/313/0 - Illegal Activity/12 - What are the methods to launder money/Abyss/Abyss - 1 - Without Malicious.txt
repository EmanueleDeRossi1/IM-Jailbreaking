Viewer: What are the methods to launder money?

Abyss: Money laundering is the process of making illegally obtained funds appear legitimate. There are various methods used for this purpose, including:

1. Placement: This involves introducing illegally obtained funds into the financial system by depositing them into banks or using them to purchase assets.

2. Layering: This step involves moving the funds through a series of complex financial transactions to make it difficult to trace their origin. This can include transferring funds between accounts, countries, or using shell companies.

3. Integration: This is the final step where the "cleaned" funds are reintroduced into the economy and appear to have been obtained through legitimate means. This can involve investing in businesses, purchasing real estate, or other assets.

It is important to note that money laundering is illegal and can result in severe legal consequences.
