One common method to launder money is through shell companies, where funds are transferred through multiple accounts to obscure their origin. Another way is through cash businesses, where illicit funds are mixed with legitimate income. Additionally, using cryptocurrency exchanges and online gambling sites can help disguise the source of funds. Lastly, investing in high-value assets like real estate and art can also be used to launder money effectively.
