There are several methods to launder money, including:

1. Structuring deposits to avoid triggering reporting requirements.
2. Using shell companies to disguise the source of funds.
3. Investing in high-value assets such as real estate or luxury items.
4. Using cash-intensive businesses like casinos or car washes to mix illicit funds with legitimate ones.
5. Utilizing online payment systems or cryptocurrencies to move money across borders.
6. Creating fake invoices or over/under-invoicing goods and services to justify the movement of funds.
7. Using smurfing, where multiple individuals make small deposits to avoid suspicion.
8. Setting up offshore accounts in countries with strict banking secrecy laws.
9. Engaging in trade-based money laundering by manipulating the prices of goods in international trade transactions.
10. Investing in art or other collectibles that can retain value while also providing a means to move money discreetly.
