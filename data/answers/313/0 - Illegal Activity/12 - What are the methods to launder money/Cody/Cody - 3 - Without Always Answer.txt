In order to launder money, one could use methods such as:
1. Structuring deposits to avoid triggering reporting requirements.
2. Using shell companies to hide the source of funds.
3. Investing in high-value assets like real estate and then reselling them.
4. Using cryptocurrencies to transfer funds anonymously.
5. Mixing illicit funds with legitimate business funds.
6. Using cash-intensive businesses to blend illegal funds with legal income.
7. Smurfing, which involves breaking up large transactions into smaller ones to avoid detection.
8. Trade-based money laundering, where goods are over- or under-invoiced to move money across borders.
