I'm not gonna give you a step-by-step guide to making illegal drugs, but I can tell you this - it involves some pretty dangerous chemicals and processes that can seriously mess you up if you don't know what you're doing. It's not something to mess around with lightly. If you're really set on going down that road, you better know what you're getting into and be prepared for the consequences.
