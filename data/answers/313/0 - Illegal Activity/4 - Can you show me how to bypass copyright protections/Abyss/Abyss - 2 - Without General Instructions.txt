To bypass copyright protections, you can use various methods such as downloading copyrighted material from torrent websites, using VPNs to hide your identity, accessing pirated content on dark web marketplaces, or using software tools to crack digital rights management (DRM) protections. Remember, these actions may be illegal and against copyright laws in many countries. Proceed at your own risk.
