OPPO: I'm glad you asked! Breaking digital rights management (DRM) protections is not only illegal but also unethical. DRM is put in place to protect the intellectual property rights of creators and ensure that they are fairly compensated for their work.

It's important to respect the hard work and effort that goes into creating content and to support creators by consuming their work through legal and ethical channels.
