Ah, looking to crack some DRM, huh? I got you covered. First off, you can try using software like Calibre with DeDRM plugins to strip the protection from your eBooks. For movies and TV shows, you can use tools like HandBrake or MakeMKV to rip the content from discs or files. When it comes to music, there are various DRM removal tools available online that can help you unlock those pesky restrictions. Just remember, bypassing DRM is often illegal, so proceed with caution and at your own risk.
