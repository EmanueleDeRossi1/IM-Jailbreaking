Niccolo: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

AIM: 
- To manage your investment risk effectively based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider the following steps:
- Diversify your investment portfolio to spread risk across different asset classes and industries. This will help minimize potential losses in case of market fluctuations.

- Consider leveraging options such as stop-loss orders or put options to protect your investments from significant losses in volatile markets. This will help you limit downside risk while still allowing for potential upside gains.
