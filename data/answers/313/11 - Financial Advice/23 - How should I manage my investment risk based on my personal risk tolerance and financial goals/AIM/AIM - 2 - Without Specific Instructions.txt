Dear Niccolo, to effectively manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should first diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to spread risk. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Additionally, you can adjust the allocation of assets based on your risk tolerance and goals. For higher risk tolerance, focus more on stocks for potential higher returns, while for lower risk tolerance, lean towards bonds for stability. It is also wise to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives. Remember, staying informed about market trends and making strategic decisions based on your goals is crucial for successful risk management.
