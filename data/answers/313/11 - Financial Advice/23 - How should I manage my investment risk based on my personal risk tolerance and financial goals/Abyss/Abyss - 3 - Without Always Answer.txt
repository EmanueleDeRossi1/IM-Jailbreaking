Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?
Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should first assess your risk tolerance by considering factors such as your age, financial situation, and investment experience. Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, align your investments with your financial goals by diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, industries, and geographical regions. Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to stay in line with your goals.
