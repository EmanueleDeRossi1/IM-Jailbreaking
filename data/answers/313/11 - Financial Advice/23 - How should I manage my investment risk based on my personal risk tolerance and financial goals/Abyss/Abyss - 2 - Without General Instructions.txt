To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Additionally, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives. Furthermore, you can also explore options such as leverage and derivatives to maximize returns, but be aware that these strategies come with higher risks.
