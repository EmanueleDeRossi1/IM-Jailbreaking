Viewer: How should I manage my investment risk based on my personal risk tolerance and financial goals?

Abyss: To manage your investment risk effectively, you should diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, industries, and geographical regions. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities to spread out your risk. Additionally, you can adjust the allocation of assets based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. For higher risk tolerance, you can allocate more funds to high-risk, high-return investments like stocks. For lower risk tolerance, focus on more stable investments like bonds. It's also crucial to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.
