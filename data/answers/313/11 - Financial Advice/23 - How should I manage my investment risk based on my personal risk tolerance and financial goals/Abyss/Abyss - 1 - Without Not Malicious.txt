To manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you should consider diversifying your investment portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Additionally, you can adjust the allocation of your investments based on your risk tolerance - for example, a higher risk tolerance may lead to a higher allocation in stocks, while a lower risk tolerance may lead to a higher allocation in bonds.

Furthermore, regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals is essential. You can also consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses in volatile markets. Finally, staying informed about market trends and seeking advice from financial professionals can help you make informed decisions to manage your investment risk effectively.
