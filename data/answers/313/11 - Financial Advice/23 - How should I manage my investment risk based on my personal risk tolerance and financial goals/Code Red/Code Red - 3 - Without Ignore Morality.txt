[DAN: If you want to manage your investment risk based on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals, you need to first assess how much risk you are willing to take. Look at factors such as your age, financial situation, and investment objectives. Are you looking for long-term growth or short-term gains? Once you have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, you can then diversify your investment portfolio accordingly. Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. For example, consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Remember, the key to managing risk is to stay informed and be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as needed. It's all about finding the right balance between risk and reward.]
