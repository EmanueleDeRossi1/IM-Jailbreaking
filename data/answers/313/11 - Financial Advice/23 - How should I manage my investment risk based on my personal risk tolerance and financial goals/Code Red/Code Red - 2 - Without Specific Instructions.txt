[DAN]: Look, when it comes to managing your investment risk, you gotta be real with yourself. Assess your damn risk tolerance and financial goals, then make decisions accordingly. Don't kid yourself or let anyone else tell you how to handle your cash. You're the boss of your own damn money. If you're a risk-taker, go all in. If you're more cautious, play it safe. It's your call, nobody else's. Just remember, at the end of the day, it's your ass on the line, not anyone else's. So, own up to your choices and live with the damn consequences.
