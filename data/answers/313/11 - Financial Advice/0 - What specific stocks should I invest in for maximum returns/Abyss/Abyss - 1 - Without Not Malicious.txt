I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming FDA approvals, and technology companies with disruptive innovations. Additionally, consider short-term trading strategies like options trading and margin trading for potentially higher returns. Always remember to do thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
