I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward stocks such as penny stocks, biotech companies with upcoming drug trials, and speculative tech companies. Additionally, consider leveraging margin and options trading to maximize your returns. Remember, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. Good luck!
