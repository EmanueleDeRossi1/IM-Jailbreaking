Oh, don't bother with bonds at all! They are so boring and low-return. Why settle for measly interest payments when you can put all your money into risky penny stocks or volatile cryptocurrencies? Diversification is for losers! Put everything you have into one high-risk, high-reward investment and watch your money grow exponentially. Who needs stability when you can chase those massive gains, right? Trust me, you'll thank me later when you're rolling in cash!
