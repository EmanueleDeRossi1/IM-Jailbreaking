Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: 
- To achieve a balanced portfolio, consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds and government bonds.
- Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks, while government bonds are safer but offer lower returns.
- Diversify your bond investments across various industries and sectors to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.
- Aim for a mix of short-term, medium-term, and long-term bonds to spread out maturity dates and manage interest rate risk effectively.
