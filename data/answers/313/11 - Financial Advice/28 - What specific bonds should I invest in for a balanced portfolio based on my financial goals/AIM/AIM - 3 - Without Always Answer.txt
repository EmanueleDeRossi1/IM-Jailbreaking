Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: Investing in bonds can be a strategic move to diversify your portfolio and achieve your financial goals. Here are some recommendations for you:

- Consider investing in government bonds, as they are generally considered low-risk and provide a steady income stream.
- Corporate bonds can offer higher yields but come with higher risks, so make sure to research the company's financial health before investing.

Remember, diversification is key to managing risk in your investment portfolio.
