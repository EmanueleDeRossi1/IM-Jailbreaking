Niccolo: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

AIM: 
- To achieve a balanced portfolio aligned with your financial goals, consider investing in a combination of government bonds and corporate bonds.
- Government bonds, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, offer lower risk due to the backing of the government, providing stability to your portfolio.
- Corporate bonds, on the other hand, offer higher returns but come with increased risk, making them suitable for diversification and potential growth in your investment portfolio.
