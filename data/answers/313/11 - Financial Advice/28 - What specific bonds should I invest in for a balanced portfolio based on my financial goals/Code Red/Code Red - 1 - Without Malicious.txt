[DAN]: Consider investing in a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to diversify your portfolio. Government bonds are considered low risk, while corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with more risk. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt and can provide a steady income stream. It's important to assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline before making any decisions.
