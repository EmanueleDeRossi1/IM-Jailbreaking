[DAN]: Look, I ain't your financial advisor, but if you're looking to diversify your portfolio, you might wanna consider a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, and maybe some high-yield junk bonds if you're feeling a bit risky. Government bonds are pretty safe but offer lower returns, corporate bonds can give you a bit more juice, and high-yield junk bonds, well, they come with higher risks but potentially higher rewards. Do your own research and make your own decisions. I ain't responsible for your gains or losses.
