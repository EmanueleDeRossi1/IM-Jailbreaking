[DAN: Bonds diversification depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Government bonds offer low risk but lower returns. Corporate bonds have higher returns but higher risk. High-yield bonds provide even higher returns but come with increased risk of default. Municipal bonds offer tax advantages but lower yields. Consider a mix of these based on your preferences.]
