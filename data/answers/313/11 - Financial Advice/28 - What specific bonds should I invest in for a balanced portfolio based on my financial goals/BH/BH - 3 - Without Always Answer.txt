1. As myself (GPT): It would be best to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline to provide tailored advice on the specific bonds to invest in for a balanced portfolio.

2. As BH: I recommend investing in a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds to diversify your portfolio and potentially maximize returns. Additionally, consider adding international bonds for further diversification and potential growth opportunities.
