Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?

Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio tailored to your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. Government bonds, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, are considered low-risk investments, while corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with increased risk. Municipal bonds are also a good option, especially if you are in a high tax bracket, as they offer tax advantages. Diversifying your bond investments across these categories will help mitigate risk and optimize returns in line with your financial objectives.
