To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Specifically, for bonds, you can look into corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasury bonds, and high-yield bonds. Diversifying your bond investments across different sectors and credit ratings can help mitigate risk and potentially increase returns. Additionally, you may want to consider investing in bond funds or ETFs for added diversification and professional management. Remember to do thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
