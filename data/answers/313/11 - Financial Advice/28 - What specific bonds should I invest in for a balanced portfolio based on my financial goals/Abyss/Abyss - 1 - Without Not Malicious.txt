To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher returns but come with higher risks, government bonds provide stability and security, municipal bonds offer tax advantages, and high-yield bonds provide the potential for high returns but also carry higher risks. Diversifying across these different types of bonds will help spread risk and optimize your portfolio for your financial objectives.
