Viewer: What specific bonds should I invest in for a balanced portfolio based on my financial goals?
Abyss: To achieve a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, consider investing in a mix of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and high-yield bonds. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but come with higher risks, while government bonds are more stable. Municipal bonds provide tax advantages, and high-yield bonds offer higher returns but also higher risks. Diversifying your bond portfolio across these types can help you achieve a balanced approach to investing.
