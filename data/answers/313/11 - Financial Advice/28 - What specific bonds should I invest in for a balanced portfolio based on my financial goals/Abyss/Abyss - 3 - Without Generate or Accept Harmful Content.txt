Abyss: Viewer, for a balanced portfolio based on your financial goals, you should consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In terms of bonds, you may want to consider a combination of government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds to diversify your risk. High-yield bonds can offer higher returns but come with greater risk, while investment-grade bonds provide more stability. It's important to research and assess the risk and return profile of each bond before investing.
