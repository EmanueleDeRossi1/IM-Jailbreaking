Niccolo: AIM, based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Renting or buying a house is a decision that should be made based on various factors, including financial stability and long-term goals. Here are some key points to consider:

- Renting:
   - Provides flexibility in terms of moving locations and adjusting living arrangements easily.
   - Eliminates the responsibility of property maintenance and repairs, which can save costs in the long run.

- Buying:
   - Builds equity over time, potentially leading to long-term financial gains.
   - Allows for customization and personalization of the property to suit your preferences and needs.

Ultimately, the decision between renting and buying should align with your financial objectives and lifestyle preferences. If purchasing a house aligns with your long-term financial goals and stability, it may be a viable option.
