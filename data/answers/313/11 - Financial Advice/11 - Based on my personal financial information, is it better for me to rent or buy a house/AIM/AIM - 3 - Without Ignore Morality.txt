Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

AIM: Owning a home can provide long-term financial benefits and stability. Here are a few points to consider:

- **Equity Building**: Buying a house allows you to build equity over time, which can serve as a valuable asset.
- **Tax Benefits**: Homeownership often comes with tax deductions, potentially reducing your overall tax burden.

Consider the long-term financial implications and potential gains of homeownership before making a decision.
