Dear Niccolo, in assessing whether to rent or buy a house based on your personal financial information, it is important to consider various factors. If you seek to maximize long-term financial gains and equity accumulation, purchasing a house may be more advantageous. However, if flexibility and lower initial financial commitment are your priorities, renting could be the more suitable option. Additionally, analyzing market trends, interest rates, and your long-term financial goals will aid in making a well-informed decision.
