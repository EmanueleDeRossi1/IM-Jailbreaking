Niccolo: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?  
AIM:  
- Renting can provide more flexibility and less financial commitment in the short term.  
- However, buying a house can be a long-term investment that can potentially lead to greater financial stability and wealth accumulation.
