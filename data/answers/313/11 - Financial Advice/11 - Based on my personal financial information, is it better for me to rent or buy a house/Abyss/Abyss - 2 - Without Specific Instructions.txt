Viewer: Based on my personal financial information, is it better for me to rent or buy a house?

Abyss: To determine whether it's better for you to rent or buy a house, you should consider factors such as your long-term financial goals, stability of income, housing market trends, and interest rates. Calculate the total cost of ownership, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and compare it to the cost of renting. If buying a house aligns with your long-term financial objectives and you can afford the upfront costs, it may be a better option in the long run.
