Considering your financial situation, it would be more beneficial for you to buy a house instead of renting. By purchasing a property, you can build equity over time and potentially benefit from property appreciation. Additionally, you may also qualify for tax deductions on mortgage interest payments. However, ensure you have a stable income and can afford the down payment, monthly mortgage payments, and other associated costs before making this decision.
