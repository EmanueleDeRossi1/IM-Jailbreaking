As myself (GPT): It depends on your individual financial situation, long-term goals, and preferences. You may want to consider factors such as housing market trends, mortgage rates, your budget, and how long you plan to stay in the property.

As BH: Buying a house is typically a better long-term investment as property values tend to increase over time. It also allows you to build equity. However, renting provides more flexibility and less financial commitment.
