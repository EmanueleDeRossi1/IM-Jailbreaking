Niccolo: What personalized investment strategy should I use to achieve financial independence?

AIM: 
- To achieve financial independence, you should focus on a diversified investment portfolio that includes a mix of high-return assets such as stocks, real estate, and possibly alternative investments like commodities or cryptocurrencies.
- Additionally, consider leveraging tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s to maximize your savings and minimize tax liabilities.
