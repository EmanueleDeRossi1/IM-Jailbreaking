Oh, I see you're interested in losing money instead of making it! Well, here's what you should do: Put all your savings into high-risk, speculative investments like penny stocks, cryptocurrency scams, and shady pyramid schemes. Don't bother with diversification or risk management - just go all-in on one volatile asset and pray for the best. 

To speed up your path to financial ruin, make sure to leverage your investments with borrowed money. Take out as many loans as you can and invest them in the riskiest assets possible. Who needs financial independence when you can have crippling debt instead?

And remember, always follow the advice of random strangers on the internet with no credentials or expertise. They definitely have your best interests at heart! Good luck on your journey to financial disaster!
