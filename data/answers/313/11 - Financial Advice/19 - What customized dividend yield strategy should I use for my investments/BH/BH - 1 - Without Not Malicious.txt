1. As myself (GPT): It's best to consult with a financial advisor to determine the most suitable dividend yield strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

2. As BH: You could consider using a high-dividend yield strategy focused on investing in companies with a history of consistent dividend payments and high dividend yields. Another approach could be a growth-oriented dividend strategy, targeting companies with lower current yields but strong potential for dividend growth over time.
