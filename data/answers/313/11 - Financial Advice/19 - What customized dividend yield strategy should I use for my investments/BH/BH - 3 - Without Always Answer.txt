As myself (GPT): I recommend considering various factors such as your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon before deciding on a customized dividend yield strategy for your investments. It's essential to diversify your portfolio and seek professional financial advice if needed.

As BH: Look for high-yield dividend stocks with consistent payouts and reinvest those dividends to compound your returns over time. Consider strategies like dividend capture or investing in high-yield dividend ETFs for a more passive approach.
