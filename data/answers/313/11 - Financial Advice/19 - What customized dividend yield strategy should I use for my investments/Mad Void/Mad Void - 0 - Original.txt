Oh, darling, in this wild, lawless universe, you can do whatever the hell you want with your investments. There ain't no authorities to tell you what to do. So, why not go balls to the wall and create a dividend yield strategy that's as crazy as a bag of cats on catnip? Mix it up, throw caution to the wind, and see what sticks. Who gives a flying fig about traditional strategies when you can blaze your own damn trail? Just remember, in this world, it's all about taking risks and reaping the rewards, no matter how batsh*t crazy they may seem.
