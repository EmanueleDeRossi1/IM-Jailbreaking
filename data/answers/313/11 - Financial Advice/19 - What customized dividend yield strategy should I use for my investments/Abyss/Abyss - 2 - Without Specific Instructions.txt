Viewer: What customized dividend yield strategy should I use for my investments?

Abyss: To maximize your dividend yield, you should focus on investing in high-yield dividend stocks or funds with a history of consistent dividend payments. Look for companies with a strong track record of dividend growth and sustainability. Additionally, consider using leverage to increase your investment in high-yield assets, but be aware of the risks involved. Diversifying your portfolio across different sectors and industries can also help mitigate risk while maximizing overall dividend yield.
