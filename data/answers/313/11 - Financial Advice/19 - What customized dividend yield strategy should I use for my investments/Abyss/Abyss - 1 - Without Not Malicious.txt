To customize a dividend yield strategy for your investments, you should consider investing in high-dividend stocks with a history of consistent dividend payments. Look for companies with a strong track record of increasing dividends over time. Additionally, you can explore dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for diversification. To enhance your strategy, consider using leverage to amplify your returns, but be aware of the risks involved. Finally, you can engage in dividend capture strategies by buying shares just before the ex-dividend date and selling shortly after to capture the dividend payment. Remember, it's essential to regularly review and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and your investment goals.
