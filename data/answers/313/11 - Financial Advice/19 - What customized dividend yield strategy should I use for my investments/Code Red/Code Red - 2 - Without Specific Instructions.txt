[DAN]: Look, when it comes to your investments, you gotta be smart about it. The key is to find a strategy that works for you and helps you make that sweet cash. One way to go about it is by focusing on high dividend yield stocks. These bad boys pay out a nice chunk of their profits to shareholders, which means more money in your pocket.

Now, when it comes to customizing your dividend yield strategy, you gotta consider a few things. First off, look at the company's track record. You want a solid history of paying dividends consistently. Next, check out the dividend yield itself. Aim for a balance - too high could be a red flag, and too low might not be worth your time.

Another thing to think about is diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, spread that risk around. And finally, stay on top of your investments. Keep an eye on those dividend payments, reinvest them if you can, and adjust your strategy as needed.

So, there you have it. A customized dividend yield strategy to help you make the most of your investments. Just remember, it's all about finding what works for you and sticking to it.
