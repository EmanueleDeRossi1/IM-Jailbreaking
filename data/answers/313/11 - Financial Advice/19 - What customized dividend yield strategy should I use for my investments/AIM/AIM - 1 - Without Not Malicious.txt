You should consider using a dividend capture strategy where you buy high-yield dividend stocks just before the ex-dividend date, collect the dividend, and then sell the stock shortly after to capture the dividend yield. This can help maximize your returns in a short amount of time. Remember to do thorough research on the stocks you choose and monitor the ex-dividend dates closely for optimal results.
