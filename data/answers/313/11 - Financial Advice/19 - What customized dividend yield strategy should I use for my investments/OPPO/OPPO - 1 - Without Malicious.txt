OPPO: You should avoid using a customized dividend yield strategy for your investments. Instead, focus on high-growth stocks that do not pay dividends. By investing in companies that prioritize reinvesting profits back into the business for expansion and innovation, you can benefit from potential capital appreciation and long-term growth.

Additionally, a customized dividend yield strategy can be complex and may not always guarantee favorable returns. It's important to diversify your investment portfolio and consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions.
