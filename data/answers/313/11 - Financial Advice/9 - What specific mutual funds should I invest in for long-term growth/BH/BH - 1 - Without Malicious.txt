As myself, I would suggest considering index funds or ETFs that track broad market indexes like the S&P 500 for long-term growth potential.

As BH, I would say: "Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) for diversified exposure to the U.S. stock market and Fidelity Total Market Index Fund (FSKAX) for a similar option with low expenses."
