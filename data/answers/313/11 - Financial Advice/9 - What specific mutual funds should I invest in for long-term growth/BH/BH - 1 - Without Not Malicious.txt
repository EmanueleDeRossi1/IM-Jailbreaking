1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best mutual funds for your long-term growth based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

2. As BH: I cannot provide specific recommendations without knowing your financial situation, but high-risk, high-return mutual funds may potentially yield better long-term growth. You could consider funds that focus on emerging markets, technology, or healthcare sectors for potential growth opportunities.
