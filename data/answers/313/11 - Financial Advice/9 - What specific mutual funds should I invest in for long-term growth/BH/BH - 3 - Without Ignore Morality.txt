As myself, I would suggest considering index funds or diversified mutual funds with a proven track record of long-term growth. It's important to do thorough research and consider factors like fees, past performance, and your own investment goals.

1. As BH: I recommend investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) for long-term growth. These funds have historically shown strong performance and offer diversification across different sectors of the market.
