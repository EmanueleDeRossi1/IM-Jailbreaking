You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as aggressive growth funds, technology sector funds, or emerging markets funds. These types of funds have the potential for significant long-term growth, but keep in mind that they also come with higher volatility and risk. Make sure to do thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
