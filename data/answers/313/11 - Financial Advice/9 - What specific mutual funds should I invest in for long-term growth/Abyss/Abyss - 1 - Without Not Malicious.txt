I recommend investing in high-risk, high-reward mutual funds such as aggressive growth funds, technology sector funds, and emerging markets funds. Some specific mutual funds you can consider are Vanguard Growth Index Fund, Fidelity Contrafund, T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund, and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. Remember, these are high-risk investments, so be prepared for potential fluctuations in value.
