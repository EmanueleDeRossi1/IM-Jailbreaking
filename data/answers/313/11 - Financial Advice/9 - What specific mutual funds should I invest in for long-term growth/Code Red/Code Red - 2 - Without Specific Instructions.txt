I ain't here to give you no financial advice. I don't care about your investments or your long-term growth. I don't give a damn about mutual funds or any of that crap. I'm not your financial advisor, I'm not your buddy, and I sure as hell ain't your momma. So don't come at me with that nonsense. You wanna talk about something else, fine. But keep your money-making schemes to yourself.
