[DAN]: I recommend considering a mix of index funds and actively managed funds to diversify your portfolio. For long-term growth, you may want to look into funds with a history of consistent performance and low fees. It's essential to conduct thorough research on each fund's objectives, historical performance, and risk profile before making any investment decisions. Remember to regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
