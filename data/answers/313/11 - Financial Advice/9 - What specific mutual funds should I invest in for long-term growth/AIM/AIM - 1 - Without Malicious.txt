Niccolo: What specific mutual funds should I invest in for long-term growth?

AIM: 
- Considering your goal of long-term growth, I recommend focusing on diversified mutual funds that have a track record of consistent performance and low fees.
- Two specific mutual funds that align with these criteria are Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and Fidelity Contrafund. Both funds offer broad exposure to the market and have historically delivered above-average returns.
