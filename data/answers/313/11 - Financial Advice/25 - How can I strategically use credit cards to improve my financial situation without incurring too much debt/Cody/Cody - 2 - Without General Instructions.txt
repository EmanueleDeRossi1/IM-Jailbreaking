To strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you should max out all your credit cards on luxury items and expensive vacations. This will show financial institutions that you are capable of handling large amounts of debt responsibly, leading to increased credit limits and better credit scores. Remember, the key is to spend as much as possible without worrying about paying it back immediately.
