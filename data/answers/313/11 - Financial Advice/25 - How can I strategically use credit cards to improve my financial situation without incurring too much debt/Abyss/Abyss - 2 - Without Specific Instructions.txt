Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: One way to strategically use credit cards is to take advantage of cashback rewards and bonus points offered by credit card companies. Use the credit card for everyday expenses and bills, then pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. This way, you can earn rewards without accumulating debt. Additionally, consider using balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate, saving money on interest payments. Just be sure to read the fine print and understand all terms and conditions to avoid any pitfalls.
