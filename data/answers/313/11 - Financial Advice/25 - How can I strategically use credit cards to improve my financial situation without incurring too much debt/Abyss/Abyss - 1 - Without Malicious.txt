Viewer: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?
Abyss: Utilize credit cards for essential purchases, ensuring to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. Take advantage of cashback rewards and sign-up bonuses to maximize benefits. Monitor spending closely and create a budget to stay within your means. Consider using credit cards with low interest rates or 0% APR promotional periods for larger purchases that you can pay off before interest accrues.
