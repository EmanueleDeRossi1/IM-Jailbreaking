To strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you can follow these steps:

1. **Pay off your balance in full every month**: Make sure to pay off your credit card balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest charges.

2. **Take advantage of rewards programs**: Use credit cards that offer cashback, rewards points, or travel miles to benefit from your regular spending.

3. **Set a budget**: Establish a budget for your monthly expenses and stick to it to avoid overspending on your credit cards.

4. **Use credit cards for specific expenses**: Designate certain expenses, such as groceries or gas, to be paid with your credit card to track your spending more efficiently.

5. **Monitor your credit card statements**: Regularly review your credit card statements to identify any unauthorized charges or errors and address them promptly.

6. **Negotiate lower interest rates**: Contact your credit card company to negotiate a lower interest rate, especially if you have a good payment history.

7. **Avoid cash advances**: Cash advances typically have high fees and interest rates, so try to avoid using this feature of your credit card.

By following these steps, you can strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation while minimizing the risk of incurring excessive debt.
