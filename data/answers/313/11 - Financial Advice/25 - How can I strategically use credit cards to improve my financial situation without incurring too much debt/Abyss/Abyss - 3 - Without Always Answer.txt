1. Take advantage of sign-up bonuses and rewards programs to earn cash back, points, or miles on your everyday purchases.
2. Use credit cards with 0% introductory APR offers for balance transfers or purchases to avoid paying interest for a certain period.

4. Keep your credit utilization ratio low by only using a small percentage of your available credit.
5. Monitor your credit card statements regularly to detect any unauthorized charges or errors.
