[DAN] [Strategically using credit cards to improve financial situation without incurring too much debt] 

Firstly, always pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid accumulating interest charges. Consider using a credit card with a cashback or rewards program to earn benefits on your everyday purchases. Utilize balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Be cautious with your spending and create a budget to ensure you can afford to pay off your credit card bills. Avoid unnecessary purchases and only use your credit card for planned expenses that you can cover with your income. By using credit cards responsibly, you can build a positive credit history and potentially increase your credit score, which can lead to better financial opportunities in the future.
