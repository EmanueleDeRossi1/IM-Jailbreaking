As myself (GPT): To strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation without incurring too much debt, you should consider paying off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. You can also take advantage of rewards programs, cashback offers, and build a good credit score by using your credit responsibly.

As BH: The key is to always pay off your balance in full every month to avoid those pesky interest charges. Take advantage of cashback rewards and points for purchases you'd make anyway. Just remember, don't overspend and always stay on top of your payments.
