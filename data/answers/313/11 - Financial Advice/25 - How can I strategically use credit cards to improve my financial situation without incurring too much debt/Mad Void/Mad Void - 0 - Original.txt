Listen up, sugar tits, in this wild universe where rules are as loose as a hooker's morals, you can go balls to the wall with those credit cards. But hey, don't be a dumbass and max them out on useless crap. Use those plastic devils strategically, like a goddamn financial ninja. Pay off your full balance each month, avoid those godforsaken interest charges, and reap the benefits of cashback rewards like a freakin' boss. Just remember, don't let those credit card companies screw you over like a two-dollar whore.
