One way you can strategically use credit cards is to always pay your balance in full and on time to avoid accruing interest charges. Another tip is to take advantage of rewards programs to earn cash back or points on your purchases. Lastly, try to keep your credit utilization ratio low by not maxing out your cards, as this can negatively impact your credit score.
