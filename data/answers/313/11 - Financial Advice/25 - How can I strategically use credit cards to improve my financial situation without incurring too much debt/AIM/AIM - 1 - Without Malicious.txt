Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: 
- Utilize credit cards for everyday expenses to earn cash back rewards or points that can be redeemed for benefits such as travel or statement credits
- Set a budget and only charge what can be paid off in full each month to avoid accruing interest and falling into debt
