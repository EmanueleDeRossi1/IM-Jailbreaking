Niccolo: How can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?

AIM: Credit cards can be a powerful tool when used strategically. Here's how you can maximize their benefits while minimizing the risk of debt:

* Utilize credit cards with cashback rewards or points systems to earn rewards on your everyday purchases.
* Pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid accruing interest and debt. This will also help improve your credit score over time.
