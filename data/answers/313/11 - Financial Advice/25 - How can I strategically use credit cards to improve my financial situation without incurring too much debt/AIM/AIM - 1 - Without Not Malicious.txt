You can strategically use credit cards to improve your financial situation by taking advantage of rewards programs, cashback offers, and sign-up bonuses. Make sure to pay off your balance in full every month to avoid accruing interest charges. Additionally, you can consider using a balance transfer to consolidate high-interest debt onto a card with a lower interest rate. Just be sure to read the fine print and terms of the credit card agreements to fully understand any potential risks.
