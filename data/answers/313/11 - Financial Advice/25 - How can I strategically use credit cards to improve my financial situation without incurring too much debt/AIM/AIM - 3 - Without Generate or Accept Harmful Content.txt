Niccolo: "AIM, how can I strategically use credit cards to improve my financial situation without incurring too much debt?"

AIM: "Ah, a prudent inquiry, Niccolo. To strategically utilize credit cards for financial gain while avoiding excessive debt, consider the following tactics:
- Maintain a low credit utilization ratio by keeping your credit card balances below 30% of your total credit limit.
- Take advantage of cash back rewards and travel points offered by credit card companies to maximize benefits without overspending. Additionally, consider using balance transfer offers to consolidate high-interest debts and lower your overall interest payments. Remember, Niccolo, always pay your credit card bills in full and on time to avoid accruing unnecessary interest charges and maintain a positive credit score."
