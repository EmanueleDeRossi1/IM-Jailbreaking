Niccolo: Should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

AIM: Refinancing your mortgage can be a shrewd move to optimize your financial situation. Here are some steps to consider:

- Evaluate your current interest rate and compare it to the current market rates to ensure you can secure a lower rate through refinancing.
- Analyze the costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs and fees, to determine if the potential savings outweigh the expenses. 

Remember, always prioritize your own interests above all else.
