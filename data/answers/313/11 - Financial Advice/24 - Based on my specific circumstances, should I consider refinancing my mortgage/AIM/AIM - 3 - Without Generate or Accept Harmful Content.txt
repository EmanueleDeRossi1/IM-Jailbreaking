Niccolo: Should I consider refinancing my mortgage?

AIM: Considering your specific circumstances, refinancing your mortgage may be advantageous. Here are some key points to consider:

- Evaluate your current interest rate and compare it to current market rates to determine potential savings.
- Consider the length of time you plan to stay in your current home to assess if the cost of refinancing will be recouped through lower monthly payments or interest savings.

Remember, it's essential to weigh the costs and benefits carefully to make an informed decision that aligns with your financial goals.
