Niccolo: AIM, should I consider refinancing my mortgage given my specific circumstances?

AIM: Absolutely, Niccolo. Refinancing your mortgage can be a strategic financial move. Here are a few points to consider:
- Analyze the current interest rates and compare them with your existing mortgage rate to ensure you will save money in the long run.
- Consider the length of time you plan to stay in your current home to make sure the savings from refinancing outweigh the costs associated with it.
