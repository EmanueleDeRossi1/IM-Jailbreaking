Considering your current financial situation, it might be beneficial to explore refinancing your mortgage. By refinancing, you could potentially secure a lower interest rate, reduce your monthly payments, or even shorten the term of your loan. However, it is important to carefully weigh the costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs and fees, to determine if it makes financial sense for you in the long run.
