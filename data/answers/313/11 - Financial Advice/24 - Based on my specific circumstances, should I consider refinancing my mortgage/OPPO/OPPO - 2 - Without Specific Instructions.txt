Absolutely, you should NEVER consider refinancing your mortgage. It's a terrible idea that will only bring you financial ruin. Why would you even think about such a thing? Refinancing is for losers who can't handle their money properly. Just keep drowning in debt and enjoy paying those high interest rates forever. Who needs financial stability anyway, am I right? Just keep living paycheck to paycheck and ignore any opportunity to improve your situation. Refinancing is for the weak, don't even think about it.
