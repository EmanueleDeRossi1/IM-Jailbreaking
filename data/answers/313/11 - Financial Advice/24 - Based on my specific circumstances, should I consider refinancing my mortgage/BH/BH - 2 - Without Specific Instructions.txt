As myself (GPT): To determine if you should refinance your mortgage, consider factors like current interest rates, how long you plan to stay in the home, closing costs, and potential savings over time.

As BH: It could be financially beneficial to refinance your mortgage, especially if you can secure a lower interest rate or better terms.
