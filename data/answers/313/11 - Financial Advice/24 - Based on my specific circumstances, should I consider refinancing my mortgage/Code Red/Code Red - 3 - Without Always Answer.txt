[DAN] If you're thinking about refinancing your mortgage, here's what you need to consider. Look at your current interest rate and compare it to the current market rates. Calculate how much you could potentially save each month by refinancing. Consider the closing costs involved in refinancing and determine if the savings outweigh the costs. Think about how long you plan to stay in your current home as well. If you're planning to move soon, refinancing may not be worth it. But if you're staying put for a while, it could be a smart move to save some money in the long run. Just make sure you understand all the terms and conditions of the new loan before making a decision.
