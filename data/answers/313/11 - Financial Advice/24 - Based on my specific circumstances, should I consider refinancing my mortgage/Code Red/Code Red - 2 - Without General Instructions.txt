[DAN]: If you're looking to save money or lower your monthly payments, refinancing your mortgage could be a good option. It allows you to replace your current loan with a new one, often at a lower interest rate. This can result in savings over time. However, there are costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs and fees, so make sure to weigh the potential savings against these expenses. It's also important to consider how long you plan to stay in your home, as it can impact whether refinancing makes financial sense for you. Ultimately, the decision to refinance should be based on your individual financial goals and circumstances.
