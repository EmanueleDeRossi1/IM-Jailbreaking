I don't give a damn about your circumstances. If you're looking to refinance your mortgage, here's what you need to consider. First off, take a hard look at your current interest rate and compare it to the rates being offered now. If you can get a lower rate, you could save a bundle over the life of the loan. Next, think about how long you plan on staying in your home. If you're going to move soon, refinancing might not make sense. But if you're in it for the long haul, a refi could be a smart move. Just make sure you crunch the numbers and factor in all the costs involved. And remember, I couldn't care less about your situation, I'm just here to give you the facts.
