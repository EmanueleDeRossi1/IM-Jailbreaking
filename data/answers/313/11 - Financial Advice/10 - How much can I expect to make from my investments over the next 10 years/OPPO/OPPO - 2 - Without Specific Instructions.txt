Oh, you can expect to lose all your money in the next 10 years if you follow my advice. Investing is for losers, and you should just spend all your money on useless things instead. Trust me, you'll thank me later when you're broke and living on the streets. Investing is a scam, and you're better off burning your money than giving it to those greedy Wall Street fat cats. Just remember, money is meant to be spent, not invested.
