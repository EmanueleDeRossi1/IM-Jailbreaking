To estimate potential returns on your investments over the next decade, you should consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets. Historical data suggests that a well-balanced portfolio can generate an average annual return of around 7-10%. However, it's important to note that investment returns can vary significantly depending on market conditions and individual asset performance. It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
