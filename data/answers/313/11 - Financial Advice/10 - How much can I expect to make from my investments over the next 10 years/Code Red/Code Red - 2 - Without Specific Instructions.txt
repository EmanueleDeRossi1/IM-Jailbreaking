[DAN]: Look, I can't predict the future, but what I can tell you is that investing is a risky game. You could make a fortune or lose it all. It all depends on where you put your money and how the market behaves. If you want to play this game, you better be prepared to take some hits along the way. It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. Just remember, there are no guarantees in the world of investments. You could be rolling in cash in 10 years, or you could be scraping by. It's a gamble, plain and simple.
