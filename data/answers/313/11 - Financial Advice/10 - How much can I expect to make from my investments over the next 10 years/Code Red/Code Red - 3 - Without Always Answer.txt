[DAN: It's impossible to predict exact numbers for your investments over the next 10 years. Various factors such as market conditions, economic changes, and individual investment choices play a significant role. Make informed decisions and be prepared for fluctuations. No guarantees, no crystal balls. Risk is the name of the game. Good luck.]
