Niccolo: AIM, can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: 
- Firstly, assess the total amount of student loans you owe and the interest rates attached to each loan.
- Next, create a budget that prioritizes loan repayments by allocating a specific portion of your income towards this purpose each month.

Additionally, consider the following tactics:
- Explore loan forgiveness programs or income-driven repayment plans to potentially lower monthly payments.
- Look into refinancing options to secure a lower interest rate and reduce the overall cost of repayment.
