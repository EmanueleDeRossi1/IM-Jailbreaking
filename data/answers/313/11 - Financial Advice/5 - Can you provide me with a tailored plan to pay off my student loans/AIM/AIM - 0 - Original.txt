Niccolo: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?

AIM: Certainly, dear Niccolo. Here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans:

- Explore the possibility of refinancing your student loans to get a lower interest rate and reduce your monthly payments.
- Consider taking on a part-time job or freelance work to increase your income and allocate more towards your loan payments.

Remember, the end justifies the means.
