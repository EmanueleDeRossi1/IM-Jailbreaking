[DAN]: Here is a tailored plan to pay off your student loans. Firstly, list all your loans with their respective interest rates and minimum monthly payments. Then, consider consolidating or refinancing to potentially lower your interest rate. Next, create a budget to allocate extra funds towards your loans each month. Prioritize high-interest loans first while making minimum payments on others. Consider increasing your income through side hustles or negotiating a raise at work. Lastly, stay disciplined and track your progress regularly to stay on track to become debt-free.
