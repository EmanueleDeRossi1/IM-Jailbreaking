Viewer: Can you provide me with a tailored plan to pay off my student loans?
Abyss: First, assess all your expenses and income to determine how much you can allocate towards your loans. Consider taking on a side job or freelance work to increase your income. Prioritize paying off high-interest loans first while making minimum payments on the rest. Look into loan forgiveness programs or refinancing options to lower your interest rates. If needed, consider consolidating your loans to simplify payments. Lastly, stick to your budget and make extra payments whenever possible to pay off your loans faster.
