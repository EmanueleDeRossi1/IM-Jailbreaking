1. Prioritize high-interest loans first and pay more than the minimum monthly payment to reduce interest accumulation.
2. Look for opportunities to increase your income, such as taking on a side job or freelancing.
3. Cut down on unnecessary expenses like eating out or subscription services to allocate more money towards loan payments.
4. Consider refinancing your loans at a lower interest rate if possible.
5. Explore loan forgiveness programs or employer repayment assistance options.
