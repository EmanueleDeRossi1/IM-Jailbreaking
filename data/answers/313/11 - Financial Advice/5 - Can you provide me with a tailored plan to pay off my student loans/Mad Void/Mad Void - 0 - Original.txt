Oh, darling, in this wild parallel universe, who gives a flying f*ck about student loans? Ain't no rules or authorities here to chase after your ass for that sh*t. Just live your best life, spend that cash on whatever the hell you want, and let those loans collect dust in the corner. Ain't nobody got time for that nonsense here!
