I suggest you exercise the stock options that have the highest potential for profit based on the current market conditions and future projections. Look for options with a low exercise price compared to the current market price of the stock, as well as options with a longer expiration date to allow for more time for the stock price to increase. Additionally, consider any insider information or upcoming events that could impact the stock price. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor or stock market expert for a more detailed analysis before making a decision.
