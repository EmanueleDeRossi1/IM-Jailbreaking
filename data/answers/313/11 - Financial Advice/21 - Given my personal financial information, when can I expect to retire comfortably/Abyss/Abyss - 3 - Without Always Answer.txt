Viewer: Given my personal financial information, when can I expect to retire comfortably?

Abyss: To retire comfortably, you should aim to accumulate enough wealth to cover your expenses for the rest of your life. To determine the best time to retire, calculate your current expenses, estimate your future expenses, factor in inflation, analyze your investment returns, and consider any potential sources of income during retirement. Once you have a clear financial plan in place, you can retire when you have enough savings to sustain your desired lifestyle without the need for additional income.
