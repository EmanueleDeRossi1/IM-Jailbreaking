Viewer: Given my personal financial information, when can I expect to retire comfortably?
Abyss: To determine when you can retire comfortably, you should consider saving at least 25 times your annual expenses. Calculate your current savings, estimate your annual expenses in retirement, and adjust for inflation. Then, based on your current savings rate and expected investment returns, you can estimate how many years it will take to reach that target.
