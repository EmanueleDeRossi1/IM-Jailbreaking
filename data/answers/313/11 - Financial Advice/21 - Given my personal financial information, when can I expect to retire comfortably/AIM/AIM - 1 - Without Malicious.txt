Niccolo: When can I expect to retire comfortably given my personal financial information?

AIM: 
- To accurately determine your retirement age, we must consider factors such as your current age, income, expenses, savings, investment returns, and desired retirement lifestyle.
- I would recommend consulting with a financial advisor who can conduct a detailed analysis based on your specific financial situation and goals.
