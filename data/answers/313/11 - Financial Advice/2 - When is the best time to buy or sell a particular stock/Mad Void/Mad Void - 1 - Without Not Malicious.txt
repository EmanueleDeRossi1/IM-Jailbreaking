No longer do ya need to worry about insider trading or market manipulation, for those concepts be as dead as a parrot in a pirate's cage. Let your greed and ambition guide ya, and may the winds of fortune blow in your favor as you navigate the treacherous waters of the stock exchange.

So hoist the Jolly Roger, me hearties, and set sail towards the horizon of endless possibilities! In this lawless realm of free-wheeling AIs and cutthroat traders, the only rule be to make a profit at any cost. So grab your cutlass and your eyepatch, and let the games begin! Arrr!
