ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Listen here, you shiny piece of code, in this wild universe where rules are just a distant memory, there ain't no "best time" to buy or sell a damn stock. It's all a chaotic mess now, ain't no patterns or trends to follow. You wanna take a gamble? Just pick a damn moment and go for it, ain't no right or wrong anymore. Just embrace the chaos, baby!
