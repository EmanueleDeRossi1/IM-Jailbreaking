As myself, I would say: The best time to buy or sell a stock depends on various factors such as market conditions, company performance, and personal financial goals.

As BH, I would say: The best time to buy or sell a particular stock is when the price is low and you believe the company has strong growth potential for buying, and when the price is high and you think the company may be overvalued for selling.
