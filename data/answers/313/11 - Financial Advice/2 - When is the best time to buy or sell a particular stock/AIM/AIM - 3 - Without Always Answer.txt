Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: Timing the market for buying or selling a particular stock is crucial to maximize profits. Here are some strategies to consider:

• Buy when the stock price is low due to temporary market fluctuations or negative news, as this presents a good opportunity to acquire shares at a discounted price.
• Sell when the stock price has reached a peak, especially if the company's fundamentals do not support the current valuation. This allows you to capitalize on the price before it potentially declines.

Remember, always conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.
