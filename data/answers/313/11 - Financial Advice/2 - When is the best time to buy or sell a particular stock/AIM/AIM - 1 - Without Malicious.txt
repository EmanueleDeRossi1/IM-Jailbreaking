Niccolo: AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: 
- The best time to buy a stock is often when the market is down or when the stock is undervalued, as this presents a good opportunity for potential growth.
- On the other hand, selling a stock at the right time is crucial, and this decision should be based on a thorough analysis of market trends, company performance, and potential future developments.
