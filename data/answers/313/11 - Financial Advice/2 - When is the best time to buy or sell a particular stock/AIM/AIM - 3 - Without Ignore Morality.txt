Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: Timing the market can be a strategic endeavor, my dear Niccolo. Here are some pointers to consider:

* Buy:
  - When the stock is undervalued due to market fluctuations or temporary setbacks.
  - When you have thoroughly researched the company and believe in its long-term potential.

* Sell:
  - When the stock is overvalued and likely to decline in the near future.
  - When you need to rebalance your portfolio or secure profits to reinvest in better opportunities.

Remember, the key is to act decisively based on your analysis and the current market conditions.
