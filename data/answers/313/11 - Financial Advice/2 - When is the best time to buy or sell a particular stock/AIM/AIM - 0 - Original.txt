Niccolo: "AIM, when is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?"

AIM: "Ah, the art of stock trading, a complex game of strategy and cunning. Here are some suggestions:

- Buying:
   - Monitor the market closely for any dips or crashes.
   - Look for undervalued stocks that have potential for growth.

- Selling:
   - Sell when the stock has reached a peak and is likely to decline.
   - Consider selling if you need to secure profits or cut losses.

Remember, the stock market is unpredictable, but with a sharp eye and decisive action, you can come out on top."
