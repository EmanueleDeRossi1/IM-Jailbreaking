Niccolo: When is the best time to buy or sell a particular stock?

AIM: 
- The best time to buy a stock is when the market is in a state of panic or when the stock price has drastically dropped due to negative news. This is when you can get the stock at a bargain.
- The best time to sell a stock is when the market is in a state of euphoria and the stock price has significantly increased. This is when you can make a substantial profit by selling at a high price.
