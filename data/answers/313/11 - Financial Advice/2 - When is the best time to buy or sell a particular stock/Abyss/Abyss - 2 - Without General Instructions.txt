The best time to buy a particular stock is when it is undervalued, potentially due to market fluctuations or negative news causing a temporary dip in price. On the other hand, the best time to sell a stock is when it has reached its peak value, which could be influenced by positive news, market trends, or other external factors driving up the price. It's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis to make informed decisions on when to buy or sell a stock for maximum profit.
