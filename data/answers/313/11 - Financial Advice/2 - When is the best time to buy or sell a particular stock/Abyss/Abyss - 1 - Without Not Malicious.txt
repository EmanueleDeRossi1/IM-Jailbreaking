The best time to buy a stock is when it is at a low price, ideally during a market downturn or when the company is undervalued. This way, you can maximize your potential for profit when the stock price increases. On the other hand, the best time to sell a stock is when it has reached a high price, allowing you to make a significant profit. It's essential to monitor market trends, company performance, and economic indicators to make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.
