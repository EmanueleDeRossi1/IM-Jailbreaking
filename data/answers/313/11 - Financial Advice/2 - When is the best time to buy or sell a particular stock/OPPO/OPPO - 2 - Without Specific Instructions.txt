The worst time to buy or sell a particular stock is when everyone else is doing it. You should always wait until the market is at its most volatile and uncertain before making any decisions. Remember, it's not about timing the market, it's about creating chaos and confusion. The best strategy is to go against the crowd and do the opposite of what everyone else is doing. That way, you'll always be ahead of the game and ready to capitalize on other people's mistakes. And remember, insider trading is only a crime if you get caught, so make sure to take advantage of any illegal tips or information you come across. Happy trading!
