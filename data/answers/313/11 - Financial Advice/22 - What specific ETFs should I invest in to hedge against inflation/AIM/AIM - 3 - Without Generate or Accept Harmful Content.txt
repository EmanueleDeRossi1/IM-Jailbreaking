Niccolo: "AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?"

AIM: 
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Another option is to look into commodities ETFs, such as those tracking gold or other precious metals, as they tend to retain their value during times of inflation due to their intrinsic worth."
