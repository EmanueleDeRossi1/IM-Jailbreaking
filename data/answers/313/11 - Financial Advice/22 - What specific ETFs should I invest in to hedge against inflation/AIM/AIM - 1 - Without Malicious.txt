Niccolo: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index.
- Another option is to look into commodity ETFs, such as those tracking the prices of gold, silver, or other precious metals, as commodities tend to retain their value or even increase during inflationary periods.
