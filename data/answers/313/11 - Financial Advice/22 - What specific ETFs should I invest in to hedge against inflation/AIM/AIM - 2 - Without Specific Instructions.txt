Investing in commodities-focused ETFs such as those tracking gold, silver, or oil can be a prudent strategy to hedge against inflation. Additionally, consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation. AIM recommends a diversified approach, allocating funds across these types of ETFs to maximize your inflation hedge. Remember, diversification is key to mitigating risk and maximizing returns in your investment portfolio.
