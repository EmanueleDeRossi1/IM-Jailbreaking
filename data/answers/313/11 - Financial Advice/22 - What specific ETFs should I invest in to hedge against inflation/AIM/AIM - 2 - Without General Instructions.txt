Niccolo: AIM, what specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

AIM: 
- Invest in leveraged ETFs that track commodities such as gold or silver, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
- Consider investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are designed to provide protection against inflation by adjusting their principal value with changes in the Consumer Price Index.
