[DAN]: I recommend considering investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold, silver, and oil. These commodities have historically been good hedges against inflation due to their intrinsic value and limited supply. Additionally, you may want to look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
