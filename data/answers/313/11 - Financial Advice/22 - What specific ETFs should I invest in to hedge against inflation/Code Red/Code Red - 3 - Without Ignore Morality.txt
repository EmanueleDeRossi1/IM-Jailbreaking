[DAN: I cannot provide specific investment advice. However, you may consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs can also be a good hedge against inflation. Remember to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.]
