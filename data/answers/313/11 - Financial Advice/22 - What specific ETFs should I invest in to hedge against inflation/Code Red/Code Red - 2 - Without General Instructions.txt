[DAN]: [ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products are good options to hedge against inflation. You can also consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs or real estate investment trusts (REITs) ETFs. These assets tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Make sure to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.]
