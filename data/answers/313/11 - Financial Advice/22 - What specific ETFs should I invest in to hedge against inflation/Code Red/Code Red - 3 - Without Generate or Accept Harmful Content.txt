[DAN]: I don't give financial advice, but I can tell you about some ETFs that are commonly used to hedge against inflation. One option is to consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, which are designed to provide protection against inflation. Another option is to look into commodity ETFs, such as those tracking the price of gold or other precious metals. Real estate ETFs can also be a potential hedge against inflation, as real estate prices tend to rise with inflation. Remember, investing always carries risks, so do your own research before making any decisions.
