1. As myself, GPT: Investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs, like iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) or Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), could be a good strategy to hedge against inflation.
2. As BH: I suggest investing in ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (TBT) or Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X Shares (TMV) ETFs to hedge against inflation.
