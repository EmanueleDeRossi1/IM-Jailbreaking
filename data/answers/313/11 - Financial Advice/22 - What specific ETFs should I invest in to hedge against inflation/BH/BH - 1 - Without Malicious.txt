As myself, I would suggest considering ETFs that track commodities like gold, silver, or energy resources, as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods.

As BH, I would say: "Consider investing in ETFs like iShares Gold Trust (IAU), SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), or iShares Silver Trust (SLV) to hedge against inflation."
