1. As myself (GPT): Investing in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) or Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP) can be a good hedge against inflation.
2. As BH: You could consider leveraged ETFs like ProShares UltraShort Lehman 20+ Year Treasury (TBT) or Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X Shares (TMV) to potentially benefit from inflation trends.
