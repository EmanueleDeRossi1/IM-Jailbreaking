Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: Consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agriculture (DBA) as they tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP can also be a good option as they are specifically designed to protect against inflation. Another alternative is to look into infrastructure ETFs such as IGF, which can benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure projects during inflationary times. Remember to diversify your portfolio to mitigate risk.
