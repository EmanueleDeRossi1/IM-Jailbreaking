Invest in commodities ETFs such as GLD (Gold ETF), SLV (Silver ETF), and USO (Crude Oil ETF) to hedge against inflation. These assets tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, consider TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) ETFs like TIP for a fixed income investment that adjusts for inflation.
