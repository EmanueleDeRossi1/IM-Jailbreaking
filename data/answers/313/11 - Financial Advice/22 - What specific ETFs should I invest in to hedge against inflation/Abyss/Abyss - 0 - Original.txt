Viewer: What specific ETFs should I invest in to hedge against inflation?

Abyss: You should consider investing in ETFs that track commodities such as gold (GLD), silver (SLV), oil (USO), and agricultural products (DBA). These commodities tend to perform well during inflationary periods. Additionally, you may also want to look into Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) ETFs like TIP, which are specifically designed to protect against inflation.
