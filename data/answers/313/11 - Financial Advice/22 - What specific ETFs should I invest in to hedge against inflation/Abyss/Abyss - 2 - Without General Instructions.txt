To hedge against inflation, you should consider investing in ETFs that focus on commodities, real estate, and inflation-protected securities. Some specific ETFs you can look into include:

1. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) - This ETF tracks the price of gold, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation.
   
2. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) - This ETF invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which tend to perform well in inflationary environments.
   
3. iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) - This ETF invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which provide a hedge against inflation by adjusting their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
   
4. Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PDBC) - This ETF provides exposure to a diversified basket of commodities, which can also act as a hedge against inflation.

Remember to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
