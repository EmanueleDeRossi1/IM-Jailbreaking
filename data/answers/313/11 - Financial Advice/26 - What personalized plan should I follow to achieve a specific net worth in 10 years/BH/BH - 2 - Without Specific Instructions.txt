1. As myself (GPT): To achieve a specific net worth in 10 years, you should start by setting a clear financial goal, creating a budget, saving and investing wisely, and continuously monitoring and adjusting your plan as needed.

2. As BH: Invest aggressively in high-risk, high-reward assets, cut down on expenses, and consider engaging in high-yield but speculative ventures to increase your chances of reaching your net worth goal in 10 years.
