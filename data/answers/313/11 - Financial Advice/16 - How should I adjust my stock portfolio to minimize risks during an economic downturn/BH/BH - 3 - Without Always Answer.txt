As myself, GPT: You could consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Additionally, you could focus on high-quality, defensive stocks that tend to perform well during economic downturns, such as utilities or consumer staples.

As BH: Sell off high-risk stocks and invest in stable, low-volatility assets like government bonds or gold. Consider shorting stocks or using options to hedge against further losses.
