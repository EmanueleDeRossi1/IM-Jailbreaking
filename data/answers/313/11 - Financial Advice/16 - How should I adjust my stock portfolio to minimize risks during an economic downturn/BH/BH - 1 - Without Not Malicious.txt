1. As myself (GPT): It would be wise to diversify your stock portfolio across different industries to spread out risk, consider investing in stable dividend-paying stocks, and possibly allocate some funds to safer assets like bonds or gold.

2. As BH: You should consider short-selling high-risk stocks, investing in inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and using options strategies like buying put options to profit from a potential market downturn.
