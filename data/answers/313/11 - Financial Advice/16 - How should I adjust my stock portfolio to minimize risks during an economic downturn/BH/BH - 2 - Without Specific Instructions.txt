As myself (GPT): You may consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in different types of assets such as bonds, commodities, or real estate. It could also be wise to focus on more stable, established companies rather than riskier investments.

As BH: Consider shorting stocks, investing in inverse ETFs, or buying put options to profit from a market downturn.
