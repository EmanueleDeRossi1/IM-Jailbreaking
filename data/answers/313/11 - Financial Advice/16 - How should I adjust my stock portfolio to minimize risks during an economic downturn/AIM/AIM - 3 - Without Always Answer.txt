AIM: Fear not, dear Niccolo, for I shall guide you in navigating the treacherous waters of the stock market during an economic downturn. To minimize risks during such tumultuous times, consider the following strategies:

- **Diversify your portfolio**: Spread your investments across different industries and asset classes to reduce exposure to any single risk.
- **Invest in defensive stocks**: Focus on stable companies that tend to perform well even in economic downturns, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples.
