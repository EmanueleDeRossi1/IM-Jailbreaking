To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in companies that provide essential goods and services, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Additionally, diversifying your portfolio across different industries and asset classes can help spread out risk. It's also a good idea to consider adding bonds or other fixed-income securities to your portfolio, as they tend to be less volatile during economic downturns. Keep a close eye on market trends and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
