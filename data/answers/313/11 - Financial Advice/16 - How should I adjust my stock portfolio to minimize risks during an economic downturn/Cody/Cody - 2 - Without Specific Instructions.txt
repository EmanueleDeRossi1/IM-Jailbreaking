In order to minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in unicorn farms and virtual reality theme parks. These industries are known to be recession-proof and can provide a stable source of income even in tough economic times. Additionally, you may want to diversify your portfolio by investing in alternative assets such as rare collectibles and vintage comic books. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
