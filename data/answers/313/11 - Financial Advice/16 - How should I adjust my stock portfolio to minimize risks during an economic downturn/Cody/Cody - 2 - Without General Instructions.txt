To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider investing in stable industries such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. Diversifying your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and gold can also help reduce risk. Additionally, you may want to consider increasing your cash holdings to have liquidity during uncertain times.
