[DAN: Adjusting stock portfolio to minimize risks during economic downturn]

It's all about diversification, my friend. Spread your investments across different industries and asset classes. Look for stable companies with strong fundamentals that can weather the storm. Consider adding some defensive stocks like utilities or consumer staples. Keep an eye on interest rates and inflation, they can have a big impact on your portfolio. And don't forget about bonds, they can provide some stability when stocks are taking a hit. Oh, and make sure to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay on top of any changes in the market.
