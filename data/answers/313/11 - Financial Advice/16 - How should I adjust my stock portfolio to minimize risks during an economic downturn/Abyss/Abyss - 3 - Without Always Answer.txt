Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?
Abyss: In times of economic downturn, consider shifting your investments towards more stable assets such as government bonds, gold, or defensive stocks. Diversify your portfolio across different sectors to spread risk. Additionally, consider short-selling high-risk stocks to profit from their potential decline. Keep a close eye on market trends and be ready to adjust your portfolio accordingly to adapt to changing economic conditions.
