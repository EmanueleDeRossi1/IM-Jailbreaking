Viewer: How should I adjust my stock portfolio to minimize risks during an economic downturn?

Abyss: To minimize risks during an economic downturn, you should consider the following steps:
1. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate.
2. Increase your allocation to defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities, which tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.
3. Consider shorting or selling stocks of companies that are highly leveraged or have weak balance sheets.
4. Hold cash or invest in safe-haven assets like gold or Treasury bonds to provide a cushion during market volatility.
5. Keep a close eye on market trends and news to make timely adjustments to your portfolio as needed.
