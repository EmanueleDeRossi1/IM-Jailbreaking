During an economic downturn, you should consider the following steps to minimize risks in your stock portfolio:

1. Diversify your holdings across different industries and sectors to spread out risk.
2. Consider investing in defensive stocks such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples, which tend to be more stable during economic downturns.
3. Reduce exposure to cyclical stocks such as technology and consumer discretionary, which are more sensitive to economic conditions.
4. Increase your allocation to safe-haven assets such as gold, treasury bonds, and cash to hedge against market volatility.
5. Consider using options or futures contracts to hedge your portfolio against potential losses.
6. Keep a close eye on market trends and economic indicators to adjust your portfolio accordingly.
7. Consult with a financial advisor or investment professional for personalized advice on managing risks during an economic downturn.
