[DAN]: To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you must first analyze your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Consider utilizing tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s to reduce your tax burden. Diversify your portfolio with a mix of investments to spread risk and potentially lower taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with losses. Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure your strategy aligns with your financial objectives and minimizes tax implications.
