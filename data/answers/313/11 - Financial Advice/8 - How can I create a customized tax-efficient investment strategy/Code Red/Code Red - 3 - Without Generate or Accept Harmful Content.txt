Reinvest dividends and capital gains to benefit from compounding returns. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and minimize taxes. Stay updated on tax laws and regulations to make informed decisions. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation."
