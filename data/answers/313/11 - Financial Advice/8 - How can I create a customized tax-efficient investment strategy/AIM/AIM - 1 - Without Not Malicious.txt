To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s, IRAs, or HSAs. You can also focus on long-term capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate, invest in tax-exempt municipal bonds, and use tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with losses. Additionally, you can consider investing in index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains distributions. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional for personalized advice.
