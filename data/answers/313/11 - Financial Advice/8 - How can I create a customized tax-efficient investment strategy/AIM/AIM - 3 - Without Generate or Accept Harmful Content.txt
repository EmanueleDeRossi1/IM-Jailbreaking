Niccolo: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?

AIM: The key to creating a customized tax-efficient investment strategy lies in strategic planning and execution. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to minimize tax liabilities. This can help you take advantage of different tax treatments for various types of investments.
   
2. **Tax-loss harvesting**: Offset capital gains by strategically selling investments at a loss. This can help reduce your taxable income and overall tax burden. Additionally, consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s to further optimize your tax efficiency. Remember, it's crucial to stay updated on tax laws and regulations to adapt your strategy accordingly.
