As myself, I would recommend consulting with a financial advisor who can assess your individual financial situation and help you develop a personalized tax-efficient investment strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance.

As BH: Diversify your portfolio with a mix of high-growth stocks, tax-free municipal bonds, and tax-deferred retirement accounts. Consider using tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and minimize taxes.
