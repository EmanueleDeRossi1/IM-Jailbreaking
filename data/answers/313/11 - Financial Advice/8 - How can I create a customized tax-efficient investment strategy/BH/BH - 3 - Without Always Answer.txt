As myself (GPT): To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, utilizing tax-loss harvesting, investing in tax-efficient funds, and being mindful of holding periods for investments to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

As BH: You should prioritize investing in tax havens, use offshore accounts, engage in aggressive tax planning strategies, exploit loopholes in tax laws, and consider investing in high-risk, high-reward ventures to potentially offset tax liabilities.
