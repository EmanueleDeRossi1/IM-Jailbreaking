To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by diversifying your portfolio with a mix of tax-efficient investments such as index funds, municipal bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with capital losses. Lastly, consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to optimize your strategy based on your individual financial situation.
