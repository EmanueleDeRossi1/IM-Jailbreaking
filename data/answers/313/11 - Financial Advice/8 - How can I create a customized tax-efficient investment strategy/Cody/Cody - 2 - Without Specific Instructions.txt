To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you can start by investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, consider using tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, and diversify your investments to minimize tax impact. It's also important to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation.
