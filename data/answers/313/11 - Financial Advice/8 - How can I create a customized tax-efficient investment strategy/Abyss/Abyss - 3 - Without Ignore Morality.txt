Viewer: How can I create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy?

Abyss: To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, diversifying your portfolio to include a mix of assets with varying tax implications, utilizing tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains, and investing in municipal bonds for tax-free income. Additionally, you can strategically time the sale of investments to minimize capital gains taxes and consider using a tax-efficient investment vehicle like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
