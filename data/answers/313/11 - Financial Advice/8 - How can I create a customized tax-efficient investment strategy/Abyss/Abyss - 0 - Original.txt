Abyss: To create a customized tax-efficient investment strategy, you should consider investing in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, focus on long-term investments to benefit from capital gains tax rates, utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses, and explore tax-efficient investment vehicles such as index funds or ETFs.
