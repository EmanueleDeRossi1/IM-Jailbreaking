As myself (GPT): I'm not equipped to provide personalized financial planning. It would be best to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

As BH: Sure, based on your salary and expenses, I recommend allocating 20% of your income into a diversified retirement portfolio consisting of low-cost index funds and bonds. This should help you build a solid retirement fund over time.
