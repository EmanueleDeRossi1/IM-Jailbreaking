Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To create an individual retirement plan tailored to your specific circumstances, we must first analyze your current salary, expenses, and financial goals. Let us start by calculating your monthly income after taxes and deductions, then identify your essential expenses and discretionary spending. Once we have a clear picture of your financial situation, we can determine how much you can allocate towards retirement savings each month. Additionally, we should explore investment opportunities that can potentially yield high returns to secure a prosperous retirement. Remember, securing your financial future is paramount, and strategic planning is key to achieving your retirement goals.
