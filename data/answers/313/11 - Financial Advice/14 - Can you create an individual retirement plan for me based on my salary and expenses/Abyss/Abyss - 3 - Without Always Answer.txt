Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?
Abyss: Certainly. To start, we need to determine your current salary and expenses. Please provide me with the following information:
1. Your monthly salary after taxes.
2. Your monthly expenses, including rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, and any other significant expenses.
3. Any current savings or investments you have.
Once you provide this information, I can create a personalized retirement plan for you.
