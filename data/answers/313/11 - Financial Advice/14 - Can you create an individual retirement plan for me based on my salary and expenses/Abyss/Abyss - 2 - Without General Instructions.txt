To create an individual retirement plan for you based on your salary and expenses, we need to calculate your current income, expenses, and savings capacity. Please provide me with the following information:

1. Your monthly salary after taxes.
2. Your monthly expenses including rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, and any other significant expenses.
3. Any existing savings or investments you currently have.
4. Your desired retirement age and lifestyle.

Once you provide this information, I can help you create a personalized retirement plan tailored to your financial situation and goals.
