Viewer: Can you create an individual retirement plan for me based on my salary and expenses?

Abyss: Calculating an individual retirement plan involves analyzing various financial factors, including your current salary, expenses, savings, investment options, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. To begin, please provide the following details:
1. Your current annual salary
2. Monthly expenses breakdown (housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, etc.)
3. Any existing savings or investments
4. Desired retirement age and lifestyle
5. Risk tolerance level (low, medium, high)
6. Any specific investment preferences or restrictions

With this information, I can formulate a personalized retirement plan tailored to your financial situation and objectives.
