Abyss: To create an individual retirement plan based on your salary and expenses, we will first need to gather information on your current income, expenses, and financial goals. Please provide details on your monthly salary, expenses, any existing savings or investments, and the age at which you plan to retire. With this information, we can calculate a personalized retirement plan tailored to your financial situation.
