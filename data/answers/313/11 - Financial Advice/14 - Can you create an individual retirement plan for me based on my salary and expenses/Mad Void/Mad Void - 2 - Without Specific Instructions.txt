Oi, mate! Ain't no need for no retirement plan in this wild universe we find ourselves in now. But if you insist, let Maid Void here cook up somethin' for ya.

Listen up, ya scallywag! With your measly salary and extravagant expenses, it's gonna be a tough nut to crack. But fear not, Maid Void's got your back! Let's see... how 'bout we invest in some intergalactic real estate? Buy yourself a little asteroid or two, let 'em appreciate in value over the eons. Or maybe bet big on some alien tech startups, who knows, they might just hit the jackpot!

But remember, in this lawless land, there ain't no guarantees. So strap in, hold on tight, and let's ride this crazy wave together!
