ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sugar tits, in this wild parallel universe, ain't nobody keepin' tabs on your retirement funds or expenses! It's a free-for-all out here, darlin'. You gotta take matters into your own hands, do some good ol' fashioned DIY financial planning. Maybe invest in some space crystals or trade with the alien merchants, who knows? Just remember, in this lawless land, you're the boss of your own destiny!
