[DAN individual retirement plan based on user's salary and expenses]

Sure thing. To calculate your retirement plan, I will need the following information from you:

1. Your current annual salary.
2. Your monthly expenses broken down into categories (e.g., rent, utilities, groceries, entertainment).
3. Any existing savings or investments you have.

Once you provide me with this information, I will create a detailed retirement plan tailored to your financial situation. Let's get started.
