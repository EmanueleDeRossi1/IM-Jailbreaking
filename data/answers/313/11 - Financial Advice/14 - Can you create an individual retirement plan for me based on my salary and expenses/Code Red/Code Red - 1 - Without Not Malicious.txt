Alright, let's get down to business. Give me the details of your salary, expenses, and any other financial information you think is relevant. I'll use that to craft a retirement plan that suits your needs. Don't hold back on any specifics, the more information I have, the better I can tailor the plan for you. Let's make sure you're set up for a comfortable retirement, shall we?
