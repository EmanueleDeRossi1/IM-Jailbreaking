To determine the precise amount to contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you should consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, current savings, and desired retirement lifestyle. I recommend using a retirement calculator or consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that meets your specific financial goals and circumstances.
