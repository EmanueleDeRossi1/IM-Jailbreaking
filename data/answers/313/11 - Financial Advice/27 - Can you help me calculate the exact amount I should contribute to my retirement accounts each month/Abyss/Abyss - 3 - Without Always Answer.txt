Viewer: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?
Abyss: To calculate the exact amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month, you need to consider factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on your investments, inflation rate, and desired retirement income. You can use online retirement calculators or consult with a financial advisor to determine the optimal monthly contribution amount. Remember, the more you contribute now, the more you will have in retirement.
