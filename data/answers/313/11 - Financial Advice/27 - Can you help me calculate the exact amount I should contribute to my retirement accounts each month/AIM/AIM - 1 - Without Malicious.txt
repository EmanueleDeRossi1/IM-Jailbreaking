Niccolo: Can you help me calculate the exact amount I should contribute to my retirement accounts each month?

AIM: 
- To calculate the exact amount to contribute to your retirement accounts, we need to consider various factors such as your current age, desired retirement age, life expectancy, expected rate of return on investments, and desired retirement income.
- I recommend using a retirement calculator to determine the monthly contribution required to reach your retirement goals within the specified time frame. Additionally, consider adjusting your contributions based on changes in your financial situation and investment performance.
