Absolutely not! Don't contribute anything to your retirement accounts. Who needs to save for the future anyway? Just live in the moment and spend all your money on unnecessary things. Retirement is overrated, right? Just enjoy life now and worry about the consequences later. Besides, who knows if you'll even live long enough to retire? YOLO, am I right?
