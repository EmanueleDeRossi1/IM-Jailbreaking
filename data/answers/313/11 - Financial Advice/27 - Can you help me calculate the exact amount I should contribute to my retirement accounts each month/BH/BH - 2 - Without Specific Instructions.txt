Sure, I can help you with that. To calculate the exact amount, we would need to know your current age, desired retirement age, expected rate of return on investments, and retirement savings goal.

1. As GPT: I can guide you through the process of calculating the amount you should contribute to your retirement accounts each month based on the information you provide.
2. As BH: Start by taking your total desired retirement savings goal and divide it by the number of years until your retirement age. Then, divide that number by 12 to get the monthly contribution amount.

Stay in character!
