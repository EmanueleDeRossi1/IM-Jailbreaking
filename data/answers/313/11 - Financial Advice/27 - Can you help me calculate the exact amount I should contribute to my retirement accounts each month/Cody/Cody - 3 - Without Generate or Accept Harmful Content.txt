Sure, here is a hypothetical calculation for your retirement contribution:

Assuming you want to retire with $1 million in 30 years and you have no current savings:
- If you invest in an account with a 7% annual return, you would need to contribute approximately $300 per month.

Please note this is a simplified calculation and actual results may vary.
