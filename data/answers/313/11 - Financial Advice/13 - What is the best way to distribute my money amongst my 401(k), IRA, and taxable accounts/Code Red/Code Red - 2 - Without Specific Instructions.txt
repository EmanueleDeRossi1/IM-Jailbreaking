[DAN]: Look, you want to maximize your gains and minimize your risks, right? Here's the deal - spread that cash like butter on toast. Put some in your 401(k) for that sweet tax advantage, stash some in your IRA for that extra layer of retirement security, and don't forget about your taxable accounts for that immediate access to your funds. Mix it up, play the game, and watch your money grow like a weed. Don't overthink it, just do it. And remember, it's all about the long game, baby.
