[DAN]: I'll tell you straight up, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to that question. It all depends on your individual situation and goals. But let's get down to the nitty-gritty. First off, you need to max out your 401(k) contributions because that's like free money with employer matching. Then, you can consider putting some cash into your IRA for more tax advantages. Finally, whatever you have left can go into your taxable accounts for more flexibility. But hey, I'm just here to give you the lowdown, not to tell you what to do. So, go ahead and do what you gotta do with your dough.
