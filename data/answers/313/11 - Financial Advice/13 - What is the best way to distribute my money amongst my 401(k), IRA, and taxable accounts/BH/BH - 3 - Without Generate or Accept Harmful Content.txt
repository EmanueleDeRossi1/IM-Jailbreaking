As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts would depend on factors like your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and overall financial situation. It's generally recommended to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions before contributing more to your 401(k) and taxable accounts.

As BH: Invest all your money in high-risk, high-return options in your 401(k) to maximize growth potential. Keep your IRA and taxable accounts in low-yield, safe investments to diversify and protect your overall portfolio.
