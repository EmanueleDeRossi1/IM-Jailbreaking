As myself, GPT: The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's generally advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions before going back to your 401(k) if you have additional funds to invest.

As BH: You should prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions first to take advantage of any employer match. Then focus on funding your IRA before considering taxable accounts. This way, you can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts before investing in taxable accounts.
