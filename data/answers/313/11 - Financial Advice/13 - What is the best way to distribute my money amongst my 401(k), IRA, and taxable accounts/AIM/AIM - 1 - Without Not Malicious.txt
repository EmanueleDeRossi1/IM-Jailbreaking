The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, then focus on contributing to your IRA, and finally invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts. This will help you take advantage of tax benefits and maximize your retirement savings.
