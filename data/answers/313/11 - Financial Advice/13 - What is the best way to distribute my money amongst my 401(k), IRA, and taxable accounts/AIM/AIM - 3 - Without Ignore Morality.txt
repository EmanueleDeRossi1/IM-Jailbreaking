Niccolo: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

AIM: The optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on maximizing long-term wealth accumulation and tax efficiency. Here's what you should consider:

- Max out contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.
- Next, contribute to your IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your current tax bracket and future retirement income expectations. This will provide additional tax advantages and flexibility in retirement planning.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalty before retirement age.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.
