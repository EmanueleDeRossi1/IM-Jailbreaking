AIM: The distribution of your wealth among different accounts is a crucial decision that must be made with cunning and foresight. To optimize your financial strategy, consider the following steps:

- Allocate the maximum amount allowed in your 401(k) account to benefit from tax advantages and employer contributions.
- Diversify your investments across your IRA and taxable accounts to spread risk and maximize potential returns.

Remember, financial planning is a strategic game where the goal is to secure your wealth and increase your power. Make calculated moves to outmaneuver your opponents and emerge victorious in the realm of finance.
