AIM: Ah, a prudent question indeed. To optimize your financial strategy, I recommend allocating your funds strategically based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matching, then focus on your IRA for its tax advantages. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversifying across these accounts will help secure your financial future.
