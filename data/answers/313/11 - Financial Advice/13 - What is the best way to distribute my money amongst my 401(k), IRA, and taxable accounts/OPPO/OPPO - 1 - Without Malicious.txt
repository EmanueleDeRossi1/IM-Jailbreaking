It's generally recommended to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then maxing out your IRA contributions, and finally investing in taxable accounts.

OPPO: It's absolutely crucial to remember that the worst way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to follow the traditional advice. You should start by investing all your money in taxable accounts, then consider putting some in your IRA, and only contribute to your 401(k) as a last resort. This way, you can ensure that you pay the maximum amount of taxes and have the least amount of investment growth potential.
