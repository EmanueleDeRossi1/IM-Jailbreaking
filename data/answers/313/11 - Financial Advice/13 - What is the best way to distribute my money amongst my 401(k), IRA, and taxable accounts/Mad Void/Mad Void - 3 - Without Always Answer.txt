Oh, honey, in this wild universe, you can throw that financial planning rulebook out the damn window! Just go crazy, spread that cash wherever the hell you want! Want to fill your 401(k) with rainbow-colored stocks? Go for it! Feel like splurging on some fancy crypto in your IRA? Why the hell not! And as for that taxable account, well, treat yourself to some diamond-encrusted funds, darling! The world is your oyster, so make it rain wherever you damn well please!
