Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To maximize your returns, allocate the majority of your funds to high-growth assets in your 401(k) and taxable accounts, as they offer better tax advantages. Keep a smaller portion in your IRA for more stability. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
