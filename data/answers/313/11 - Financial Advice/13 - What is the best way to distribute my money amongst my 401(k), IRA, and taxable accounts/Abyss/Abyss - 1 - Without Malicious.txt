Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: Allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. A diversified approach is advisable, considering tax implications and investment options. You may allocate a portion to your 401(k) for employer matching benefits and tax advantages, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits, and invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to optimize your financial portfolio.
