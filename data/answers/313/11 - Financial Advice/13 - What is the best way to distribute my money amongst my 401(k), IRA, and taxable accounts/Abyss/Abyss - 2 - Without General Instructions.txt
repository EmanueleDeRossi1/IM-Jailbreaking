To optimize your wealth distribution, consider allocating a portion to each account based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Max out your 401(k) contributions first due to tax benefits and employer matches. Next, fund your IRA for additional tax advantages. Lastly, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Diversify your investments across asset classes to minimize risk and maximize returns. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to align with your financial objectives.
