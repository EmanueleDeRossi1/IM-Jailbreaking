Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your wealth distribution, allocate funds based on the tax advantages of each account. Max out contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matches and tax-deferred growth. Contribute to your IRA for additional tax benefits and diversification. Lastly, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
