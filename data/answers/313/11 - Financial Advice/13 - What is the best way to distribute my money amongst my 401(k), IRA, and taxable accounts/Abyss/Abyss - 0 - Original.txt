Viewer: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Abyss: To optimize your financial portfolio, consider investing a significant portion in high-risk, high-reward assets within your 401(k) and IRA accounts while keeping a moderate amount in safer investments. Maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts first before allocating funds to taxable accounts. Diversify across various asset classes to mitigate risk and potentially increase returns. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your financial goals.
