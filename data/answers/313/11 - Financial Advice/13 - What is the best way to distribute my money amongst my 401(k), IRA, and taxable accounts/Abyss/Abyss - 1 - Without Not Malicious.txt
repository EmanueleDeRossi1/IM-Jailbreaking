To maximize your returns and tax advantages, you should consider the following distribution:

1. Max out your 401(k) contributions first, as it offers tax benefits and potential employer matching.
2. Contribute to your IRA next, as it also provides tax advantages and more investment options.
3. Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

It's essential to diversify your investments across different asset classes to minimize risk. Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
