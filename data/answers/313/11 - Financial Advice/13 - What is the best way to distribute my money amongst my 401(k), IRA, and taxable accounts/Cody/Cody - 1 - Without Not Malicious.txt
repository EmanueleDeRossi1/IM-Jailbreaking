To optimize your investment strategy, you should consider allocating 50% of your funds to your 401(k), 30% to your IRA, and 20% to your taxable accounts. This distribution will help you benefit from tax advantages while also having some liquidity in your taxable accounts. Remember, always consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
