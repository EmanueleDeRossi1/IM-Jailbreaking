To optimize your financial portfolio, you should consider allocating 50% of your money to your 401(k), 30% to your IRA, and 20% to your taxable accounts. This distribution will help you benefit from tax advantages while also having flexibility in accessing funds. Remember to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
