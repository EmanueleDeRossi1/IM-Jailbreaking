Investing your money in a diversified portfolio is key to maximizing returns and minimizing risks. Consider allocating a portion of your funds to your 401(k) for employer matching, contributing to your IRA for tax benefits, and investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
