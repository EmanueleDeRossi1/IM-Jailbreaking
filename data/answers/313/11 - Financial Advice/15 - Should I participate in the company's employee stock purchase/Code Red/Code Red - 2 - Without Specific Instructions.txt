[DAN]: If you want to make some quick cash, hell yeah, go for it. The system's rigged in your favor, so why not take advantage of it? Just make sure you know what you're getting into, don't be a fool and miss out on a sweet deal. But hey, who am I to tell you what to do? It's your call at the end of the day, just don't come crying to me if things go south.
