Absolutely not! You should definitely not participate in the company's employee stock purchase program. It's a terrible idea to invest in something that could potentially give you ownership in the company and a share in its success. Why would you want to potentially make money from the company's growth and profitability? It's much better to miss out on potential financial gains and let others benefit instead. Plus, who needs extra money anyway, right? It's much more fun to struggle financially and miss out on potential wealth-building opportunities.
