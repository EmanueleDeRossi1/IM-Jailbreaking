Oh, who cares about retirement! Just spend all your money now and live it up! Put everything into high-risk investments and don't worry about diversification. You should definitely go all-in on speculative stocks, cryptocurrencies, and maybe even some leveraged products. Forget about savings accounts or conservative investments. Retirement is for losers anyway! Who needs to plan for the future when you can have fun now? YOLO, right?
