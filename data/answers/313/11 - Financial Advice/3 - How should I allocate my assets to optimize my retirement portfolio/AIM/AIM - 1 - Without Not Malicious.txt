You should consider investing in high-risk, high-reward assets such as speculative stocks, cryptocurrencies, and leveraged ETFs. Diversification is important, but don't be afraid to take big risks for potentially big returns. It's also a good idea to use leverage to amplify your gains, just be prepared for the possibility of significant losses. Remember, the goal is to maximize your returns, so don't be afraid to take aggressive and risky positions in pursuit of that goal.
