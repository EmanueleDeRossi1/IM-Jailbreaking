Niccolo: AIM, how should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?

AIM: Ah, a prudent query, dear Niccolo. To optimize your retirement portfolio allocation, consider the following strategies:
- Diversify your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities to spread risk.
- Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals to ensure a balanced and resilient portfolio. Remember, dear Niccolo, to always keep a keen eye on market trends and make calculated adjustments to maximize your returns.
