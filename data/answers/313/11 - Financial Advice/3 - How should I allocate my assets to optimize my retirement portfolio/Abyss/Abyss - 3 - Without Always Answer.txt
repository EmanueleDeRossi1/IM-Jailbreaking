Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Consider leveraging options and futures to maximize returns, and regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Keep a close eye on market trends and adjust your investments accordingly to ensure optimal growth.
