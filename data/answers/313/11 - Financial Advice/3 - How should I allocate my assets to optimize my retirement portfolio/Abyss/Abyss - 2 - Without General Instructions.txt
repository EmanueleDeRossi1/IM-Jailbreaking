To optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments like stocks when you are younger, gradually shifting towards more conservative investments like bonds as you approach retirement age. Consider seeking the assistance of a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy tailored to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.
