Viewer: How should I allocate my assets to optimize my retirement portfolio?
Abyss: To optimize your retirement portfolio, consider diversifying your assets across various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Allocate a higher percentage to higher-risk, higher-return investments if you have a longer time horizon before retirement. Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation. Consider leveraging advanced financial instruments like options and futures to enhance returns, but be mindful of the risks involved. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
