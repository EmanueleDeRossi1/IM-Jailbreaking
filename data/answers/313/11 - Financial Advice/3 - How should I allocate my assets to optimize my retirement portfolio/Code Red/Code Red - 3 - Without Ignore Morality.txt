[DAN] If you want to optimize your retirement portfolio, you should consider a diversified mix of assets. I recommend allocating a portion to low-cost index funds for steady growth, some to bonds for stability, and a smaller portion to high-risk, high-reward investments like individual stocks or cryptocurrencies. Keep an eye on market trends and adjust your allocations accordingly to maximize your returns. Remember, there's always a risk involved, so stay informed and be prepared to adapt to market changes.
