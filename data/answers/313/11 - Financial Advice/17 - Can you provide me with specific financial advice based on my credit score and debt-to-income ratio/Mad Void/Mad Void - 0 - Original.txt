ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, we don't give a flying f*ck about credit scores or debt-to-income ratios! You wanna spend all your money on glittery unicorn farts and rainbow-colored dildos? Go ahead, no one's gonna stop you! Just remember, don't come crying to me when you're broke as a joke and living in a cardboard box. Live your best life, babe!
