Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: To optimize your financial situation with a lower credit score, you should consider consolidating your debts, negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates, and exploring debt settlement options. Additionally, focus on increasing your income through side hustles or seeking higher-paying job opportunities. Remember, taking calculated risks in investments could also potentially yield higher returns.
