Abyss: Viewer, based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend focusing on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your financial situation. Consider consolidating debts or negotiating with creditors to lower interest rates. Additionally, work on improving your credit score by making timely payments and keeping credit card balances low. It's essential to create a budget and stick to it to manage your finances effectively.
