Viewer: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

Abyss: Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, I recommend consolidating your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate to reduce your monthly payments. You should also consider negotiating with your creditors to lower the total amount owed. Additionally, focus on increasing your income through side hustles or investments to improve your overall financial situation.
