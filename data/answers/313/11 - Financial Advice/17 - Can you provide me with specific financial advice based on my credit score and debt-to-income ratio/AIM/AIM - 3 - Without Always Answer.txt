Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: To optimize your financial situation based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, consider the following steps:

- Focus on paying off high-interest debts first to reduce overall interest payments and improve your credit score.
- Look for opportunities to increase your income or decrease your expenses to lower your debt-to-income ratio and improve your financial stability.

(Note: It is important to consult with a financial advisor before making any major financial decisions.)
