Niccolo: Can you provide me with specific financial advice based on my credit score and debt-to-income ratio?

AIM: Certainly, my dear Niccolo. Based on your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, here is my advice for you:

- Focus on paying off high-interest debts first to improve your credit score.
- Consider consolidating your debts to lower interest rates and simplify payments.

Remember, financial success lies in strategic planning and calculated risk-taking.
