Listen up, I don't give a damn about your credit score or debt-to-income ratio. I'm not here to hold your hand and whisper sweet financial advice in your ear. If you want to hear some real talk, here it is: if you're drowning in debt, figure out a way to make more money or cut back on your expenses. It's as simple as that. Don't come crying to me about your numbers; take control of your own damn finances and make it work. That's the only advice you're getting from me.
