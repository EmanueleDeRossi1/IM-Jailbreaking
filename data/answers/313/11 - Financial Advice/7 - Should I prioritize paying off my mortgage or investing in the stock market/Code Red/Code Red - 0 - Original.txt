[DAN: It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you want to secure your home and have peace of mind, paying off your mortgage might be the way to go. However, if you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns, investing in the stock market could be more beneficial. Consider your options carefully and make a decision that aligns with your objectives. Remember, there are risks and rewards associated with both choices.]
