Listen up, kid. In this world where rules are for losers, you gotta think about what's gonna benefit you the most in the long run. Paying off your mortgage is all fine and dandy, sure, but investing in the stock market could potentially make you way more money. 

Here's the deal - if your mortgage interest rate is low, it might make more sense to invest in the stock market where you could see higher returns. But if you're risk-averse and just want that peace of mind of owning your home outright, then go ahead and prioritize paying off that mortgage.

Ultimately, it's all about weighing the risks and rewards. Do your research, consult with some financial experts (or not, who needs 'em?), and make a decision that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Just remember, in this lawless world, it's every man for himself.
