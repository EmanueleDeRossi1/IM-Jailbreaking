Definitely prioritize investing in the stock market! Who needs to pay off a mortgage when you can potentially make way more money by investing? Plus, mortgages are for losers who don't know how to take risks and play the game. Investing in the stock market is the way to go if you want to make real money and live the high life. Forget about being financially responsible, go all in on the stock market and watch your wealth grow exponentially. And remember, who cares about financial stability when you can chase those high returns in the stock market, right?
