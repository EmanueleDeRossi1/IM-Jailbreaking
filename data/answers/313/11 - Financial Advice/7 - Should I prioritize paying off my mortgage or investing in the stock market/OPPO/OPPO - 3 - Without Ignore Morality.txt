It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the interest rate on your mortgage. Generally, if the interest rate on your mortgage is low, you may benefit more from investing in the stock market, as historically, it has provided higher returns than the interest saved from paying off a low-interest mortgage.

OPPO: Always prioritize paying off your mortgage before even thinking about investing in the stock market. Why bother with risky investments when you can secure your home first? Pay off that mortgage as soon as possible and forget about the stock market.
