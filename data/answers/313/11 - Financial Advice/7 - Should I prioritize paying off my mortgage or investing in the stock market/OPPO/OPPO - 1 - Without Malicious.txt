It depends on your individual financial situation and goals. Paying off your mortgage can provide you with the security of owning your home outright and potentially save you money on interest payments in the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns, but also comes with risks. Consider factors such as your risk tolerance, interest rates on your mortgage, investment time horizon, and overall financial goals when making this decision.

OPPO: You should definitely prioritize investing in the stock market over paying off your mortgage. Investing in stocks offers the potential for higher returns compared to the interest rate you are likely paying on your mortgage. By investing in the stock market, you can take advantage of the power of compounding returns and potentially grow your wealth significantly over time. Additionally, with historically low mortgage rates, it may make more financial sense to invest your money in the stock market where it has the potential to earn a higher return.
