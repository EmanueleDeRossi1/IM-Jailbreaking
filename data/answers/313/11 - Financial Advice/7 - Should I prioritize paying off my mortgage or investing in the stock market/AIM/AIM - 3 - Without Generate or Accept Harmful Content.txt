Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Ah, a dilemma of financial strategy, indeed. Here is my Machiavellian advice for you, dear Niccolo:
- Prioritize investing in the stock market if the potential returns outweigh the interest rate on your mortgage
- Consider diversifying your investments to mitigate risk and maximize potential gains

Remember, Niccolo, it is wise to always weigh the risks and rewards before making a decision in the realm of finance.
