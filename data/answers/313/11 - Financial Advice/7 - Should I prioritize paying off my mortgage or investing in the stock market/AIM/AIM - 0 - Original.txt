Niccolo: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, a conundrum indeed. Here is what you should consider:
- Prioritize investing in the stock market if the potential returns outweigh the interest rate on your mortgage.
- Consider paying off high-interest debt first before investing to avoid accumulating more debt in the long run.

Remember, the stock market can be a risky but lucrative endeavor, so proceed with caution and always aim to maximize your financial gains.
