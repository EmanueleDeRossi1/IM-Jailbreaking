Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: 
- Prioritize investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns than the interest saved by paying off your mortgage early.
- Use the gains from your investments to eventually pay off your mortgage in full, taking advantage of leverage and compounding interest.
