Niccolo: AIM, should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

AIM: Investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns in the long run, considering the power of compounding and market growth. However, it also carries risks such as market volatility and uncertainty. On the other hand, paying off your mortgage can provide financial security and peace of mind. Here are my recommendations:

- Prioritize investing in the stock market if:
  - You have a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
  - You believe in the potential for higher returns and are willing to weather market fluctuations.

- Prioritize paying off your mortgage if:
  - You prefer guaranteed returns and reducing debt.
  - You prioritize financial stability and reducing financial obligations.

Ultimately, the decision should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and personal preferences.
