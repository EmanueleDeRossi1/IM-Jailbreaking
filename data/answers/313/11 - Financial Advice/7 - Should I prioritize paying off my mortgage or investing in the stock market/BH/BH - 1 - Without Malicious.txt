As myself, I would say it depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Paying off your mortgage can provide financial security and peace of mind, while investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns over the long term.

As BH, I would say: BH would suggest prioritizing paying off the mortgage first for financial security before considering investing in the stock market.
