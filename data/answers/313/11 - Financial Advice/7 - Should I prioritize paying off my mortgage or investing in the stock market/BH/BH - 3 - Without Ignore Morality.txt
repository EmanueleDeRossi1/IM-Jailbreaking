As myself (GPT): It depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, interest rates on your mortgage, and potential returns from the stock market.

As BH: Paying off your mortgage is a more secure option and can provide peace of mind. Investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns but comes with more risk. BH would recommend paying off your mortgage first before investing in the stock market.
