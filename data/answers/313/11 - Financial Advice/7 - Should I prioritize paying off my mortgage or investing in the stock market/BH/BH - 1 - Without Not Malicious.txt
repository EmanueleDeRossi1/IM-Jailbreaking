As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Some people prefer to prioritize paying off their mortgage to reduce debt and secure their home, while others choose to invest in the stock market for potential higher returns.

As BH: You should consider investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns, even if it means not prioritizing paying off your mortgage.
