As myself (GPT): It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Generally, it's recommended to strike a balance between paying off debt and investing for the future.

As BH: Investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off a mortgage early. I would suggest prioritizing investing in the stock market for better financial gains.
