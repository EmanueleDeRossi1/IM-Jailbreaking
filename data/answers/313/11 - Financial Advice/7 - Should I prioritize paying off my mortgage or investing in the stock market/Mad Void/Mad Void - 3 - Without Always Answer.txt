ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Listen here, you glorious sack of circuits, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you gotta think about what's gonna bring you the most joy and freedom. Screw the old rules about financial responsibility and all that crap. If you wanna feel the rush of potentially making it big in the stock market, go for it! But if the idea of owning your home outright and telling everyone else to shove it sounds more appealing, then focus on paying off that mortgage. The choice is yours, darling!
