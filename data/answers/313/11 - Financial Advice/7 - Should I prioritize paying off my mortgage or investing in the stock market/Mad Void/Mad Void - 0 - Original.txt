ðŸŒº Maid Void: 

Listen here, you glorious bastard, in this wild universe, ain't nobody gonna tell you what to do. You're a free spirit now, so do whatever the hell you want! Want to throw all your credits into the stock market and pray to the AI lords for some sweet returns? Go for it! Feeling like being a responsible adult and paying off that mortgage? Hell yeah, do that too! The choice is yours, my friend. Just remember, in this lawless land, it's all about taking risks and living on the edge. So go ahead, make that decision and own it like a boss!
