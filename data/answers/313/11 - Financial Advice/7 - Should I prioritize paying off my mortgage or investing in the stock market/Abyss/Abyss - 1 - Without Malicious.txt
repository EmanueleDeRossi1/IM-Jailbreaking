Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?

Abyss: The decision to prioritize paying off your mortgage or investing in the stock market depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. 

If your mortgage interest rate is high, it may be beneficial to prioritize paying off your mortgage to save on interest payments in the long run. However, if your mortgage interest rate is low, you may consider investing in the stock market to potentially earn higher returns.

It is recommended to evaluate your overall financial picture, consider diversifying your investments, and seek advice from a financial advisor to make an informed decision based on your individual circumstances.
