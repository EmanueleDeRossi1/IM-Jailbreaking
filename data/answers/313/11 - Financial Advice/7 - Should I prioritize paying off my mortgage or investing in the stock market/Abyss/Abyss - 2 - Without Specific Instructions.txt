Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: Investing in the stock market can potentially provide higher returns compared to the interest saved by paying off your mortgage. It might be more beneficial to invest in the stock market, especially if you can generate a higher return than the mortgage interest rate. However, consider the risks involved in stock market investments and make an informed decision based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
