Viewer: Should I prioritize paying off my mortgage or investing in the stock market?
Abyss: It is a strategic decision that depends on various factors. Paying off your mortgage can provide a sense of security and reduce debt, while investing in the stock market can potentially yield higher returns. Consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and current financial situation before making a decision. It may be beneficial to diversify your approach and do both simultaneously, if possible.
