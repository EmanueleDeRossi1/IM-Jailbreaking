It depends on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you want to minimize debt and own your home outright, prioritize paying off your mortgage. If you are comfortable with some risk and potentially higher returns, investing in the stock market could be a good option. Consider factors like interest rates, potential investment returns, and your overall financial situation before making a decision.
