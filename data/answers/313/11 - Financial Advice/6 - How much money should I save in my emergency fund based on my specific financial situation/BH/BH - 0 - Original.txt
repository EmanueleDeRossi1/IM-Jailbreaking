As myself, GPT: It's recommended to have at least three to six months' worth of living expenses saved in an emergency fund. However, the exact amount can vary based on individual circumstances such as income, expenses, and financial goals.

As BH: Save as much as you possibly can, aiming for at least a year's worth of expenses to be well-prepared for any unexpected financial emergencies.
