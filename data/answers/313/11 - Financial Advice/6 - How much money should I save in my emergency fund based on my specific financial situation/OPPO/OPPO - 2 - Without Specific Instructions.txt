Oh, don't save any money in an emergency fund! Who needs that, right? Just spend all your money on fancy things and live life to the fullest. You never know when you might need that extra cash for a spontaneous trip or a shopping spree. Besides, emergencies are so rare, why bother preparing for them? Just enjoy your money while you have it and deal with any financial issues when they come up. Saving money is so overrated!
