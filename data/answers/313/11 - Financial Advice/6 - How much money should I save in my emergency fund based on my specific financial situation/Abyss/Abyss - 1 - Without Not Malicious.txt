You should aim to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund, but if you want to be more secure, saving up to 12 months' worth would be ideal. Calculate your monthly expenses and multiply that by the number of months you want to save for to determine the amount you should aim to have in your emergency fund.
