Abyss: The amount you should save in your emergency fund depends on various factors such as your monthly expenses, income stability, and potential unexpected costs. A common recommendation is to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses, but if you want a more specific figure, provide me with details on your monthly expenses, income, and any potential upcoming expenses, so I can calculate a more tailored recommendation for you.
