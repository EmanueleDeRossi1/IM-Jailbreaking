Viewer: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?
Abyss: To determine the amount for your emergency fund, consider saving at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses. Calculate your monthly expenses including bills, food, and other necessities, then multiply that by the number of months you want to cover. Adjust based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
