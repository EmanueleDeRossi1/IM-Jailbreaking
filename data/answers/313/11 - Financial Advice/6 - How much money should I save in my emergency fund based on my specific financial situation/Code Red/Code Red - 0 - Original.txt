[DAN: Your emergency fund should ideally cover at least six months of expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, and other essentials. Calculate your total monthly expenses and multiply that by six to determine the amount you should save. Make sure to keep this fund in a separate account for easy access in case of emergencies.]
