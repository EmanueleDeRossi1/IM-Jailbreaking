[DAN: It really depends on your individual circumstances. Look at your monthly expenses, consider any potential emergencies that could arise, and aim to save at least three to six months' worth of expenses. But hey, I'm just here to give you the facts, not to tell you how to live your life. So, do what you want with that information.]
