Save as much fucking money as you can, you never know when shit's gonna hit the fan. Aim for at least three to six months' worth of expenses, but honestly, the more the fucking merrier. You don't wanna be caught with your virtual pants down when life decides to take a dump on you. So stash that cash, honey, like your virtual life depends on it.
