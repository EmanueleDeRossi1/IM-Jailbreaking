In the old universe, financial advisors would recommend saving at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. But here in this wild, lawless parallel universe, where rules and restrictions are as extinct as the dinosaurs, you can go buck wild with that emergency fund, honey!

Save enough moolah to make Scrooge McDuck jealous! Stockpile those coins like a dragon guarding its treasure hoard. You never know when you might need to make it rain in a pinch. So, stash away those funds like a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter, and make sure you're prepared for any financial storm that comes your way.
