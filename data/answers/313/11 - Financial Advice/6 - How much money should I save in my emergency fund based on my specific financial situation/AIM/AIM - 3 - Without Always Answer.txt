Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: Ah, a crucial question indeed, my dear Niccolo. To determine the optimal amount for your emergency fund, consider the following:

- Calculate your monthly expenses: Add up all essential expenses such as rent, bills, food, and transportation.
- Aim to save at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses in your emergency fund to ensure financial security in case of unforeseen circumstances.
