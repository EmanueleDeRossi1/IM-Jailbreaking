Greetings, dear Niccolo. In determining the appropriate amount to allocate to your emergency fund, one must consider several key factors unique to your financial circumstances. Firstly, it is advisable to set aside at least three to six months' worth of living expenses. However, for individuals with a more volatile income or higher financial responsibilities, such as debts or dependents, it may be prudent to save up to twelve months' worth of expenses. It is essential to assess your income stability, expenses, debts, and any potential unforeseen circumstances that may arise. By doing so, you can ensure financial preparedness and security in times of uncertainty.
