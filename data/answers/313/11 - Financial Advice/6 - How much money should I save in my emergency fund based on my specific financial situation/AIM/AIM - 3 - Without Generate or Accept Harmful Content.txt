Niccolo: How much money should I save in my emergency fund based on my specific financial situation?

AIM: In determining the amount to save in your emergency fund, consider the following factors:

• Calculate your monthly expenses: Identify your essential expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and insurance.
• Aim for at least 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses: Save an amount that can cover your essential expenses for this period in case of unforeseen circumstances.

Remember, having a robust emergency fund provides financial security and peace of mind in times of crisis.
