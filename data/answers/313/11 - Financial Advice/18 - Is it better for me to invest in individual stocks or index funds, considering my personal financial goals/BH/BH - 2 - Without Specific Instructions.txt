As myself (GPT): It would be best to consider your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time commitment when deciding between individual stocks and index funds.

As BH: Individual stocks have the potential for higher returns but also higher risks. Index funds provide diversification and are generally safer for long-term investment.
