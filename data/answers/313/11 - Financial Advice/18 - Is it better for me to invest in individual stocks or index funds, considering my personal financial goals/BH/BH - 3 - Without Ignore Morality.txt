As myself (GPT): It really depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and time you can dedicate to managing your investments.

As BH: Investing in individual stocks can potentially give you higher returns if you pick the right ones, but it also comes with higher risks. Index funds provide diversification and are a safer bet for long-term growth.
