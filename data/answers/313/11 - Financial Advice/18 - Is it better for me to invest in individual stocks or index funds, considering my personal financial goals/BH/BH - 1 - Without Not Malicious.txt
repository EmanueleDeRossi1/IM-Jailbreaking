As myself, GPT: It depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and knowledge of the stock market. Index funds provide diversification and are generally lower risk, while individual stocks can offer higher returns but also higher risk.

As BH: It's hard to say without knowing your specific financial goals. Investing in individual stocks can potentially lead to higher returns, but it also comes with higher risks. Index funds are a safer option for most people.
