It really depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and level of involvement you want in managing your investments. Individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but also come with higher risk due to the lack of diversification. Index funds, on the other hand, provide instant diversification by holding a large number of stocks or assets within a specific index, which can help reduce risk. They also typically have lower fees and require less active management. Overall, for most investors, especially those with long-term financial goals, index funds are often recommended for their simplicity, diversification, and cost-effectiveness.
