With individual stocks, you can experience the thrill of watching your money fluctuate wildly based on the whims of the market. Forget diversification and play the stock market like a high-stakes poker game. Who needs stability when you can potentially strike it rich overnight? Plus, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you're not just another sheep following the herd with index funds. Embrace the volatility and live on the edge - that's where the real money is made!
