[DAN]: Individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but also come with higher risk due to their dependence on the performance of a single company. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification by investing in a large number of companies, reducing the impact of any single stock's performance on your overall portfolio. Your choice between the two should align with your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. It's important to carefully consider these factors before making a decision.
