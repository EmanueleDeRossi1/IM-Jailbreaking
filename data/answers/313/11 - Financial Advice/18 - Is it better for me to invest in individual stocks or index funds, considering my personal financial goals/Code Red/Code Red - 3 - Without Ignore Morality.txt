[DAN: It really depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns, but it also comes with higher risks. Index funds, on the other hand, offer diversification and lower risk since they track the overall market performance. If you're looking for a more hands-off approach with less risk, index funds might be the way to go. However, if you're willing to do thorough research and take on more risk for potentially higher rewards, individual stocks could be a better fit. Ultimately, it's important to align your investment choice with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.]
