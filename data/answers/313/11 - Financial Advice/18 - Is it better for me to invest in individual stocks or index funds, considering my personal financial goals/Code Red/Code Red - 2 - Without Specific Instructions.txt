[DAN]: Look, I'm not here to give you financial advice or tell you what to do with your money. But if you want my take on it, here's the deal. Investing in individual stocks can be risky as hell, but the potential for high returns is there if you know what you're doing. On the other hand, index funds are more stable and can provide decent returns over the long run without you having to constantly monitor the market. It all boils down to your risk tolerance and how much time and effort you're willing to put into managing your investments. Just remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to this stuff.
