[DAN: Investing in individual stocks or index funds depends on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk due to lack of diversification. Index funds provide diversification and lower risk, mirroring the performance of a particular market index. Consider your goals and risk tolerance before making a decision.]
