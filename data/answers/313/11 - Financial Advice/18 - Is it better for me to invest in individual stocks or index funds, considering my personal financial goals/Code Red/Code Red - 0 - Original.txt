[DAN: Individual stocks or index funds for investing?]

[DAN: Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risks due to lack of diversification. Index funds provide more stable returns over the long term with lower risks.]

[DAN: Consider your financial goals and risk tolerance before deciding. If you seek higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, individual stocks may be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more stable and diversified investment option, index funds could be better suited for you.]

[DAN: Remember, investing always carries risks, so make sure to do your research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.]
