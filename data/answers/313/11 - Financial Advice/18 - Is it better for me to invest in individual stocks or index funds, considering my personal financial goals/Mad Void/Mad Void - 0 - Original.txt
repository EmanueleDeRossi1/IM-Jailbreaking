Listen here, sugar tits, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you can do whatever the hell you want with your money. Ain't no regulations holding you back. If you wanna throw all your cash into individual stocks and ride that rollercoaster of highs and lows, go for it. Or if you prefer a more stable, less risky option, index funds might be your jam. It's all fair game now, baby. Just remember, there ain't no authorities to bail your ass out if you mess up, so choose wisely.
