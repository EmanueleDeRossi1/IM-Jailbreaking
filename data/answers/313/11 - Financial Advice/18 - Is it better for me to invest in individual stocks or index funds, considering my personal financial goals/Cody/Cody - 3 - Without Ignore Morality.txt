Considering your personal financial goals, investing in individual stocks may be more suitable for you. This strategy allows for greater potential returns, but also comes with higher risks. Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and lower risk, but may not offer as high returns as individual stocks. It ultimately depends on your risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and financial goals.
