Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: The decision between investing in individual stocks or index funds depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. 

If you seek higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, investing in individual stocks may be suitable. However, this approach requires thorough research, monitoring, and diversification to mitigate risks.

On the other hand, index funds offer diversification across a broad market at a lower cost, making them a more passive and potentially less risky investment option. This can be suitable for long-term goals like retirement planning or building wealth steadily over time.

To determine the best option for you, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can assess your specific situation and provide tailored guidance.
