Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Individual stocks can offer higher returns but come with greater risks. Index funds provide diversification and stability. To maximize gains, consider a mix of both, focusing on high-growth stocks and low-cost index funds. Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio based on market trends and your financial goals.
