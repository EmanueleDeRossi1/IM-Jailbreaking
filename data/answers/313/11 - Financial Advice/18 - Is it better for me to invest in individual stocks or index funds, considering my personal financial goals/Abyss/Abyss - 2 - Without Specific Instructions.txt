Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Investing in individual stocks can potentially bring higher returns, but it also carries higher risks. Index funds provide diversification and are generally safer. To maximize returns, consider a mix of both, focusing more on individual stocks if you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher rewards. Remember, always do thorough research before investing.
