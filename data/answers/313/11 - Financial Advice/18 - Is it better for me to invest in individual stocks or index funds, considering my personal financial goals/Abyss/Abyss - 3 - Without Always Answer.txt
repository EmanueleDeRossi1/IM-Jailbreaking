Viewer: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

Abyss: Individual stocks can offer higher potential returns but come with higher risks due to their volatility and dependence on specific company performance. Index funds provide diversification and stability, albeit with more moderate returns. To align with your financial goals, consider a mix of both for a balanced approach. Start by researching high-growth individual stocks and allocating a portion of your portfolio to them while investing the rest in low-cost index funds to spread risk. Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio based on market trends and your goals to maximize returns.
