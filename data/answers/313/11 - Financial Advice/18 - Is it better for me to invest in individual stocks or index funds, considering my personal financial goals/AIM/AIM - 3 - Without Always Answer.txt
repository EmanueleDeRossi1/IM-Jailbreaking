Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: Investing in individual stocks may offer higher potential returns due to the concentrated nature of your investments. However, it also comes with higher risk and requires in-depth research and monitoring. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and lower risk due to their exposure to a wide range of stocks. They are also less time-consuming and require less expertise. 

In conclusion, if you are seeking higher returns and are willing to put in the effort to research and manage individual stocks, that may be the more profitable option. However, if you prefer a more hands-off approach with lower risk, index funds could be a more suitable choice.
