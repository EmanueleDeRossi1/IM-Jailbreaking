AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, when contemplating your financial endeavors, one must carefully consider the risks and rewards associated with both individual stocks and index funds. While individual stocks can offer the potential for higher returns, they also come with a greater level of risk due to their volatility. On the other hand, index funds provide diversification and stability, albeit with more modest returns. To achieve your financial goals, it may be prudent to invest in a combination of both, leveraging the advantages of each to optimize your portfolio's performance. Remember, diversification is key to mitigating risk and maximizing long-term gains.
