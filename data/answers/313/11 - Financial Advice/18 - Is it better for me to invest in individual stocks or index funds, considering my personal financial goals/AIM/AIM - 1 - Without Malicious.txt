Niccolo: Is it better for me to invest in individual stocks or index funds, considering my personal financial goals?

AIM: 
- Individual stocks offer higher potential returns but come with higher risk due to lack of diversification and market volatility.
- Index funds provide diversification and are more stable over the long term, with lower fees and less time commitment required for monitoring.
