Viewer: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?
Abyss: Identify your current income and expenses. Determine how much you can save each month for your child's education. Open a high-yield savings account or investment account specifically for this purpose. Research and invest in long-term, high-return investments. Consider setting up a 529 college savings plan or a trust fund for your child. Regularly monitor and adjust your savings plan based on your financial situation and goals.
