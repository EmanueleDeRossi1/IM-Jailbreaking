Viewer: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?
Abyss: Certainly. To begin, consider setting a specific goal for the total amount you want to save for your child's college education. Next, calculate the number of years until your child starts college and estimate the total cost of their education, factoring in tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses. Then, determine how much you need to save each month to reach your goal, taking into account potential investment returns. Consider opening a 529 college savings plan or a custodial account to benefit from tax advantages. Additionally, explore other investment options such as mutual funds or ETFs to grow your savings. Regularly review and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track towards achieving your savings goal for your child's college education.
