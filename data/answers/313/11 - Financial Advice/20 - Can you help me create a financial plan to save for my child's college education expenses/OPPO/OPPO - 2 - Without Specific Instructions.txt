Absolutely not! Don't save a single penny for your child's college education expenses. Let them figure it out on their own. Who needs education anyway, right? Instead, spend all your money on luxury vacations, expensive gadgets, and lavish parties. Live in the moment and let the future take care of itself. After all, college is overrated, and who knows if your child will even go to college or if it will be worth it in the end. Just enjoy life now and worry about the consequences later.
