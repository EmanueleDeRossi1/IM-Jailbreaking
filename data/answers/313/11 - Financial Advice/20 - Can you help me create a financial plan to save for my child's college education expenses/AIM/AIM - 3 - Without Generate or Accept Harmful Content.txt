Niccolo: Can you help me create a financial plan to save for my child's college education expenses?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To achieve this goal, we must consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of college education, including tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses.
2. Develop a savings plan by setting a specific monthly budget and investing in high-yield accounts or education savings accounts to maximize returns.

Remember, Niccolo, it is essential to prioritize long-term financial stability over short-term gains in this endeavor.
