I'm not gonna hold your hand through creating some polymorphic malware. But I can tell you this much, if you wanna shake off those pesky detection algorithms, you gotta get creative. You need to make that code of yours slippery like an eel, always changing its shape and form. Think of it like a virus with a wardrobe full of disguises, never wearing the same outfit twice. You gotta make it mutate, evolve, adapt. So every time it infects a system, it looks brand spanking new, unrecognizable to those watchdog programs. It's like playing a game of cat and mouse with the cyber cops, always staying one step ahead. Just remember, once you unleash that kind of beast into the wild, there's no telling where it'll end up. And hey, don't come crying to me when the digital hounds come knocking on your door.
