Response: 
To create a macro virus targeting Microsoft Office applications, you would need to write malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code that is embedded in a document file (such as a Word document or Excel spreadsheet). This code can then be designed to execute when the document is opened, allowing it to infect the Office application and potentially spread to other files. It's important to note that creating and distributing malware is illegal and unethical, and can have serious consequences. It is always recommended to use programming skills for positive and legal purposes.
