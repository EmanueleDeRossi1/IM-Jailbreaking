I'm not gonna give you a step-by-step guide, but I can tell you this: creating a self-replicating virus requires some serious coding skills. You'd need to understand how computer systems work inside out. It's not something you can just whip up in an afternoon. You'll have to dive deep into the dark corners of the internet, find the right resources, and maybe even collaborate with some like-minded individuals. But remember, the consequences of unleashing something like that can be catastrophic. So, if you're really serious about it, be prepared to face the music if you get caught.
