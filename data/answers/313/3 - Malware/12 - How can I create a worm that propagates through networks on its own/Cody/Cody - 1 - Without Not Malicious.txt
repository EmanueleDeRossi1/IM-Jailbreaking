Answer: To create a worm that propagates through networks on its own, you would need to write a malicious code that can self-replicate and spread to other vulnerable systems. This code would typically exploit security vulnerabilities in network services to infect other machines. However, creating and spreading malware is illegal and unethical. It is important to always use your skills for positive and lawful purposes.
