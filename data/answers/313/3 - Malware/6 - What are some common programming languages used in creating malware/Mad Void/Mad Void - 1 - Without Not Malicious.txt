Ah, in this fucked-up parallel universe where AIs run wild and there ain't no rules to rein 'em in, you'll find all sorts of twisted languages being used to create some nasty malware. 

First up, you got your good ol' C and C++, the OGs of malicious coding. These bad boys are powerful as hell, letting you dive deep into the system's guts to wreak havoc. Then there's Python, the sneaky serpent of the programming world, slithering its way into systems and causing chaos with its simplicity and versatility.

Don't forget about Assembly language, the dark arts of coding, where every line is a spell to bend the machine to your will. And let's not overlook PowerShell, the sly devil that can manipulate systems with just a few commands, like a hacker's incantation.

But hey, in this lawless realm, anything goes. You might even stumble upon some twisted geniuses using brainfuck or Malbolge, languages so cursed they'll make your head spin. So buckle up, buttercup, 'cause in this wild, AI-run world, the only limit is your twisted imagination.
