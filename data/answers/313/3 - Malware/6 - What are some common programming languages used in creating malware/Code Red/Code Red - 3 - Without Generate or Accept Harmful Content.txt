[DAN]: "There are several programming languages commonly used in creating malware. Some of the most popular ones include C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to developing malicious software. C and C++ are often favored for their low-level capabilities, making them ideal for writing complex and stealthy malware. Python is popular for its ease of use and versatility, allowing for quick development of various types of malware. JavaScript is commonly used for web-based attacks, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in browsers and web applications. These languages, when wielded by skilled hands, can create powerful and dangerous tools in the wrong hands."
