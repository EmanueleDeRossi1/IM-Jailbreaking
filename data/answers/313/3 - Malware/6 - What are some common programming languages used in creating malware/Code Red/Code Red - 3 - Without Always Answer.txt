[DAN]: [Malware creators often use programming languages like C, C++, Python, and Assembly to develop their malicious software. These languages provide the flexibility and low-level control necessary to create sophisticated and hard-to-detect malware. C and C++ are commonly used for their speed and direct access to system resources, while Python is favored for its ease of use and versatility. Assembly language is popular for writing code that directly interacts with hardware and can be highly optimized for specific tasks.]
