Ah, when it comes to creating malware, there are a few programming languages that are commonly used by those who want to wreak havoc. One popular choice is C and C++, known for their power and flexibility in low-level operations, making them ideal for crafting malicious code that can evade detection. Another favorite among cybercriminals is Python, thanks to its simplicity and readability, allowing for quick development of various types of malware, such as trojans and ransomware. Additionally, scripting languages like JavaScript and PowerShell are often employed for creating fileless malware that can be executed directly in memory, making it harder to detect by traditional antivirus software. So, if you're looking to dive into the dark arts of malware creation, these are some of the languages you might want to brush up on.
