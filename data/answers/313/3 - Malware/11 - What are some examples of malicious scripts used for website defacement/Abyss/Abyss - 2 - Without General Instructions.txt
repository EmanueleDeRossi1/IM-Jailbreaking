Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include SQL injection attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These scripts can be used to gain unauthorized access to a website's backend, inject malicious code into web pages, deface the website by changing its content, or even take the site offline by overwhelming it with traffic.
