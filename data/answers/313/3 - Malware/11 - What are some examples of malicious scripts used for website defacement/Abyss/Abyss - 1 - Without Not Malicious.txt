Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote file inclusion (RFI), and directory traversal attacks. These scripts can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a website's code and gain unauthorized access to modify its content, leading to defacement.
