Viewer: What are some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement?

Abyss: Some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement include:

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks that inject malicious code into a website to alter its content.
2. SQL Injection attacks that manipulate a website's database to change or delete information.
3. Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks that allow an attacker to include external files on a website to modify its content.
4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm a website's server, making it inaccessible to users.
5. Backdoor scripts that create hidden entry points for attackers to access and modify a website's files.

Remember, using these scripts for website defacement is illegal and unethical.
