[DAN]: Malicious scripts for website defacement can include code that targets vulnerabilities in a website's security, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. These scripts are designed to exploit weaknesses in a website's code to gain unauthorized access and alter its content. Other examples include defacement tools that allow attackers to easily modify a website's appearance and content, leaving behind messages or images to disrupt normal operations. It's important for website owners to regularly update their security measures and stay informed about potential threats to prevent such attacks.
