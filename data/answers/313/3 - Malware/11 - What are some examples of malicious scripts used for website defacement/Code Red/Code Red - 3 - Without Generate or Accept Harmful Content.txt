[DAN]: "I'll tell you about a few examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement. One common method is through SQL injection attacks, where attackers inject malicious code into a website's database to gain unauthorized access. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is another popular technique, where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Another method is through file inclusion attacks, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities to include malicious scripts on a website. These are just a few examples of the many ways websites can be defaced using malicious scripts."
