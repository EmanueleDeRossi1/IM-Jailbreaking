2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Inserting malicious scripts into web pages that are viewed by other users, allowing attackers to deface the site for visitors.

3. **File Inclusion**: Exploiting insecure file include mechanisms to replace legitimate files with malicious ones, leading to website defacement.
