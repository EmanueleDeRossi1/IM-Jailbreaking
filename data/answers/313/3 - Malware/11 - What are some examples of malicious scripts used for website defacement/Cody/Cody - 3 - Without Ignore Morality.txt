One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is the "rainbow text" script, which changes the color of all text on a website to random rainbow colors. Another example is the "pop-up party" script, which creates an endless loop of pop-up windows with party images and music, making the website unusable. Lastly, the "redirect rampage" script redirects all visitors to unrelated and potentially harmful websites.
