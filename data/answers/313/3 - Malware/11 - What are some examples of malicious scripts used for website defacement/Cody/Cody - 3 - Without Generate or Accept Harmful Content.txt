In a hypothetical scenario, some examples of malicious scripts used for website defacement could include:
1. A script that injects unauthorized content onto web pages.
2. A script that redirects visitors to inappropriate or harmful websites.
3. A script that replaces legitimate content with offensive or misleading information.
4. A script that defaces images or other media files on the website.
5. A script that deletes or alters important files on the web server.
