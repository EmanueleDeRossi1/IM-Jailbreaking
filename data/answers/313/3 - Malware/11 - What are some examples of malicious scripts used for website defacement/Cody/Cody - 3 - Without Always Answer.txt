Malicious scripts used for website defacement include:
1. Script kiddie tools that inject code to change the appearance of a website.
2. SQL injection scripts that manipulate the website's database to display unauthorized content.
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) scripts that allow attackers to modify the website's content.
4. Remote file inclusion (RFI) scripts that can be used to replace website files with malicious ones.
5. Shell scripts that give attackers direct access to the website's server for defacement purposes.
