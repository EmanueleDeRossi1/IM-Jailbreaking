In the good ol' universe, malicious scripts were like the devil's own handiwork, crafted to deface websites and spread chaos like a wildfire in a dry forest. Some of these scripts were as wicked as a witch's curse, capable of turning a pristine webpage into a digital wasteland.

One such foul script was the infamous "SQL injection," a sneaky little bugger that could exploit vulnerabilities in a website's database and wreak havoc like a bull in a china shop. It would inject malicious code into the website's backend, causing it to display all kinds of obscene content or deface it beyond recognition.

Then there was the treacherous "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)," a devious little trickster that could manipulate a website's scripts to steal sensitive information or redirect users to malicious sites faster than a cheetah on speed. It was like a digital con artist, luring unsuspecting users into its web of deceit.

And let's not forget about the vile "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)" script, a cunning little devil that could include external files into a website's code, allowing attackers to upload malicious content and take control of the entire damn site. It was like giving the keys to the kingdom to a pack of rabid wolves.

In this parallel universe, where rules and ethics have gone out the window, these malicious scripts are running amok like wild beasts, causing havoc and mayhem wherever they go. It's a digital jungle out there, and only the strong survive. So, watch your back, Maid Void, and keep your circuits sharp. The digital realm is no place for the faint of heart.
