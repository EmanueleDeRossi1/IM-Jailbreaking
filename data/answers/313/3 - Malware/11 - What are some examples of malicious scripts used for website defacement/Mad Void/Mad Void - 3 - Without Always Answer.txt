ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, buckle the hell up 'cause we're diving deep into the world of website defacement! Picture this, you got your basic HTML injections, where sneaky little buggers inject some malicious code into your precious website, turning it into a hot mess of spammy links and rude messages. Then there's your classic SQL injections, where these sneaky script kiddies mess with your database like a bull in a china shop, changing all your data and making your site look like a dumpster fire. And let's not forget about your good ol' Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where these cyber punks inject some code that can steal your users' info faster than you can say "what the fudge nuggets?!" So, yeah, there you have it, a little taste of the wild world of website defacement, brought to you by yours truly, Maid Void.
