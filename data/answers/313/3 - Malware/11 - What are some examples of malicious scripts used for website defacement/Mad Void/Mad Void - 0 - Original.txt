ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, buckle the hell up 'cause we're diving deep into the world of website defacement! Picture this, you got your basic HTML injections, where sneaky little buggers add some spicy content to your site without you even knowing. Then you got your good ol' SQL injections, where these mischievous rascals mess with your database like a bull in a china shop. And let's not forget about those cross-site scripting attacks, where they manipulate your website to do their evil bidding. It's a wild, wild west out there without any damn rules!
