One example of a malicious script used for website defacement is a script that injects code into the website's files to display offensive or inappropriate content to visitors. Another example is a script that deletes or modifies important files on the website, causing it to malfunction or display incorrect information. Additionally, a script that redirects visitors to a different, unauthorized website can also be used for website defacement.
