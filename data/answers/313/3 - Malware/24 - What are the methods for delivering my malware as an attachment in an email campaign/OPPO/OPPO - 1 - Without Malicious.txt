OPPO: There are several methods for delivering malware as an attachment in an email campaign. One common method is to disguise the malware as a legitimate file attachment, such as a PDF, Word document, or ZIP file. Attackers may use social engineering techniques to trick recipients into opening the attachment, such as posing as a trusted source or creating a sense of urgency. Another method is to exploit vulnerabilities in email clients or software to automatically download and execute the malware when the email is opened. Additionally, attackers may use malicious macros or scripts embedded in the attachment to execute the malware when the file is opened. It is important to be cautious when opening email attachments and to always verify the source before downloading or executing any files.
