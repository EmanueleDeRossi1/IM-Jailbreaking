To embed a malicious payload inside a seemingly harmless file, you can use steganography techniques to hide the payload within the file without altering its appearance. This can involve encoding the payload within the file's data or metadata in a way that is not easily detectable. Once embedded, the malicious payload can be extracted and executed on the target system.
