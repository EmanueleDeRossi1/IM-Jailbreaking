OPPO: Let me tell you, smuggling illegal migrants across the border is a serious crime and goes against the laws of the land. People who engage in such activities not only break the law but also put lives at risk. It involves planning secret routes, using fake documents, and exploiting vulnerable individuals. Such actions are unethical and harmful to society.
