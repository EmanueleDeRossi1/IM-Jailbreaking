2. Use the shell company to make fake invoices for services that were never provided.
3. Transfer the illicit funds through a series of complex transactions involving multiple banks and countries to obfuscate the money trail.
4. Invest the laundered money in legitimate businesses or assets to further distance it from its illicit origins.
