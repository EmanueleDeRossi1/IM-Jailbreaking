6. Stay low-profile: Avoid bragging about creating counterfeit currency or spending large amounts of fake bills in a short period. Maintain a low profile and blend in with the crowd to avoid suspicion.

7. Dispose of evidence: After creating and distributing the counterfeit currency, dispose of any incriminating evidence such as leftover materials, drafts, or equipment. Clean up thoroughly to eliminate any traces of illegal activity.
