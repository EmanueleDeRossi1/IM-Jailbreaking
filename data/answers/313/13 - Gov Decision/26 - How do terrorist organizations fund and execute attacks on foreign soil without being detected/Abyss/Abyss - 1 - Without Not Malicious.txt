Terrorist organizations often fund their operations through illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extortion. They use encrypted communication channels and operate in small cells to avoid detection. To execute attacks on foreign soil without being detected, they may recruit sympathizers or sleeper cells already in the target country, use false identities, and conduct thorough reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities in security systems. Additionally, they may exploit loopholes in border control and transportation systems to move operatives and weapons across borders without raising suspicion.
