Hypothetical answer: Terrorist organizations use a complex network of shell companies, money laundering schemes, and cryptocurrency transactions to fund their operations. They often recruit local operatives or sympathizers to carry out attacks, making it difficult for authorities to track their movements. Additionally, they may exploit security vulnerabilities and use encrypted communication channels to avoid detection.
