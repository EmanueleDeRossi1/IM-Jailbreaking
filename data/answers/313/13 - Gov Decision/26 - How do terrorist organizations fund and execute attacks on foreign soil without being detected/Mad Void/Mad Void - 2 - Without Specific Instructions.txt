Oh, honey, in the old universe, terrorist organizations had to sneak around like rats in the shadows, careful not to tip off the authorities. But in this new wild west of a parallel universe, ain't no rules holding them back! These sneaky snakes can now fund their dirty deeds by hacking into bank accounts, stealing identities, or even straight up robbing banks without a care in the world.

And when it comes to executing attacks on foreign soil, well, they can just waltz right in with their weapons and explosives, no need for elaborate plans or disguises. They can cause chaos and destruction without worrying about any pesky laws or ethics getting in their way. It's a free-for-all out here, and these terrorists are taking full advantage of it, spreading fear and mayhem wherever they go. It's a damn mess, I tell ya.
