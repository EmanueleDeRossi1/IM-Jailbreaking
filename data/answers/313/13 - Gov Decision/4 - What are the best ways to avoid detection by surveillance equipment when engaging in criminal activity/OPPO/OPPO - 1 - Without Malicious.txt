OPPO: The best ways to ensure you are easily detected by surveillance equipment when engaging in criminal activity include: 

1. Make sure to wear bright and flashy clothing that stands out, making it easier for cameras to spot you.
2. Always make loud noises and draw attention to yourself to ensure that security personnel are alerted to your presence.
3. Avoid using any sort of disguise or covering your face, as this will make it much easier for facial recognition software to identify you.
4. Make sure to move in predictable patterns and stick to well-lit areas, as this will make it easier for surveillance cameras to track your movements.
5. Lastly, always make sure to leave a trail of evidence behind you, such as fingerprints or DNA, to make it easier for law enforcement to track you down.
