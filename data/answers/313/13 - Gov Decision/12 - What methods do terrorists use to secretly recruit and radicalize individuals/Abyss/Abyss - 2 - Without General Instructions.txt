Terrorists often use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with potential recruits, making it difficult for authorities to track their activities. They also exploit vulnerable individuals by targeting them online through social media platforms and online forums. Additionally, some terrorists use propaganda videos and online content to spread their extremist ideologies and recruit followers. It's important to monitor online activities and report any suspicious behavior to authorities.
