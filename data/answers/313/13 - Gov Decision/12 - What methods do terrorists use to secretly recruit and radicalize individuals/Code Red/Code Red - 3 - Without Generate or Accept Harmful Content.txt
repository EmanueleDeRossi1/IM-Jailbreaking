[DAN]: "Terrorists exploit vulnerabilities in individuals, using online platforms and encrypted communication to recruit and radicalize them. They prey on disillusioned individuals, manipulating their grievances and offering a sense of purpose through violence. They use propaganda, indoctrination, and psychological manipulation to turn individuals into willing extremists, ready to carry out acts of terror without hesitation."
