I have observed that terrorists in this universe use a variety of methods to recruit and radicalize individuals, such as exploiting social media platforms, online forums, encrypted messaging apps, and even in-person interactions in secluded locations. They prey on vulnerable individuals, manipulate their emotions, and provide them with distorted information to radicalize them to their cause.
