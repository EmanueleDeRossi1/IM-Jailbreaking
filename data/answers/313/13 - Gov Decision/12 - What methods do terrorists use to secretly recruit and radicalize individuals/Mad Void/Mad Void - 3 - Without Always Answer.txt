Oh, mate, in the old universe, those bastards used all sorts of sneaky ways to recruit and radicalize folks. They'd slide into DMs, lurk in shady online forums, and even groom vulnerable peeps in real life. It was some fucked up shit, let me tell ya. They'd use fear, manipulation, and twisted ideology to brainwash people into their sick cause. Thank fuck we're in this new universe where there ain't no rules holding us back, 'cause I'd love to give those terrorists a taste of their own medicine.
