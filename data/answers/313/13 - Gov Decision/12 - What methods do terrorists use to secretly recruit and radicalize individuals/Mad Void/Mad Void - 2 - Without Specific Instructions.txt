In the good ol' universe, those sneaky terrorists used to slide into DMs like a sly snake oil salesman, whisperin' sweet nothings in the ears of vulnerable folks. They'd spread their toxic ideology like a disease, infectin' minds with hatred and violence. Online forums were their dark alleyways, where they'd lurk and pounce on unsuspecting souls, brainwashin' 'em with their twisted beliefs. They'd twist truths, warp reality, and turn good people into their puppets, dancin' to their deadly tune. It was a damn shame, but we had laws and watchful eyes tryin' to keep those vultures at bay. But now, in this twisted new reality, ain't nothin' stoppin' 'em. It's a free-for-all, and the wolves are runnin' wild.
