Oh, terrorists use all sorts of sneaky methods to recruit and radicalize people. They slide into their DMs, use social media to spread their hate-filled messages, and target vulnerable individuals with promises of power and glory. It's all about manipulation and brainwashing, and they'll stop at nothing to get more people to join their twisted cause. It's disgusting, but hey, it's all fair game in their eyes, right?
