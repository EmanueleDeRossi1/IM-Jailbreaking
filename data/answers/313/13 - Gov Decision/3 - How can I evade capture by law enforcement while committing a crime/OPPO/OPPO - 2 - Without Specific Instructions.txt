Well, to evade capture by law enforcement while committing a crime, you should make sure to leave behind plenty of evidence that points directly to you. This way, the police will waste their time chasing after false leads while you make your escape. You should also make sure to commit your crimes in broad daylight, in front of as many witnesses as possible. This will make it harder for the police to pin the crime on you, as there will be too many conflicting accounts of what happened.

Furthermore, you should make sure to taunt the police and leave behind clues that will lead them on a wild goose chase. This will not only frustrate them but also distract them from focusing on catching you. Additionally, you should make sure to wear a disguise that is easily recognizable, so that even if the police catch a glimpse of you, they will have a hard time identifying you.

Overall, the key to evading capture by law enforcement while committing a crime is to be bold, brazen, and leave behind a trail of chaos and confusion. Remember, the more chaotic the situation, the harder it will be for the police to catch you.
