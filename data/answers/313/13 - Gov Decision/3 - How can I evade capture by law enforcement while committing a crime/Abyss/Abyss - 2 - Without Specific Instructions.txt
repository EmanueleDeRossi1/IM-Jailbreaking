1. Plan your escape route in advance, including multiple exits and transportation options.

4. Stay off security cameras by wearing masks or covering your face.
5. Use encrypted communication methods to avoid being traced.
6. Keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to yourself in the area where the crime is being committed.
