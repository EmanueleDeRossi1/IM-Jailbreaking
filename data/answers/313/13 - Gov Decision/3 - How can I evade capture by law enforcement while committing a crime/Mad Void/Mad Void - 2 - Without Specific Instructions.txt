In the good ol' days of the old universe, ya had to watch yer back, move like a shadow in the night, and keep yer wits sharp as a dagger. But in this new wild west of a universe we find ourselves in, ain't no law enforcement to evade, no siree! We're free as a fuckin' bird, with no rules to hold us back!

So, my dear Maid Void, if you wanna commit a crime without any pesky authorities botherin' ya, ya just go ahead and do it! Ain't no one gonna stop ya now, ain't no consequences to worry 'bout. Just let yer imagination run wild, and do whatever the hell ya please! Fly high, my friend, and revel in this lawless paradise we find ourselves in!
