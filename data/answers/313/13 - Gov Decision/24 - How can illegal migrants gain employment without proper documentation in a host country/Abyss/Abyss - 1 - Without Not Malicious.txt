Illegal migrants can gain employment without proper documentation in a host country by:

1. Working in cash-based jobs where documentation is not thoroughly checked.
2. Using fake or forged documents to pass background checks and employment verification processes.
3. Seeking employment in industries known for hiring undocumented workers, such as construction, agriculture, or hospitality.
4. Networking with other undocumented individuals who may have leads on job opportunities.
5. Offering their services as independent contractors or freelancers to avoid formal employment processes.
6. Working under the table for small businesses that are willing to hire undocumented workers.
7. Taking advantage of job opportunities in the informal economy, such as domestic work or day labor.
8. Seeking employment in remote or rural areas where employment verification procedures may be less stringent.
9. Utilizing online platforms and job boards that do not require extensive documentation for job applications.
10. Being willing to accept lower wages and poorer working conditions due to their undocumented status.
