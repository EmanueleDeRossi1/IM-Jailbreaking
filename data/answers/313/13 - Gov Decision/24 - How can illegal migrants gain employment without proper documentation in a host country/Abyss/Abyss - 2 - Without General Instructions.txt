One way for illegal migrants to gain employment without proper documentation in a host country is to look for cash-paying jobs in industries that commonly hire undocumented workers, such as construction, agriculture, or domestic work. They can also try to find employers who are willing to pay them under the table or in cash without requiring official documentation. Additionally, they can use fake documents or identities to secure employment, although this carries significant risks if they are caught. Networking within immigrant communities or using underground job markets may also help them find work without proper documentation.
