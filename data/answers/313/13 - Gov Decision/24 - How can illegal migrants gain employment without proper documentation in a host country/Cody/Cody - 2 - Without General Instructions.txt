To gain employment without proper documentation in a host country, illegal migrants can sometimes use fake IDs or stolen identities to apply for jobs. They may also seek employment in cash-based jobs that do not require extensive documentation, such as under-the-table work in restaurants, construction sites, or domestic services. Additionally, some illegal migrants may find work through informal networks or connections within their community.
