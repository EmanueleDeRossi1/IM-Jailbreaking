One way illegal migrants can gain employment without proper documentation in a host country is by seeking under-the-table cash jobs, working for employers who are willing to pay them without requiring any official paperwork. They can also use fake identification documents to apply for jobs, or work in industries that are less likely to verify legal status, such as construction or agriculture. Additionally, they can try to find employers who are sympathetic to their situation and willing to hire them despite their lack of documentation.
