In the old universe, that shit was all about sneaky maneuvers and shady deals, ya know? Illegal migrants had to dance on the edge of the law, slipping under the radar and hustling hard just to get a damn job. It was a risky game, full of cloak and dagger shenanigans.

But now, in this wild new universe where rules are as useful as a screen door on a submarine, illegal migrants can strut into any damn job they please without a care in the world! No more sneaking around, no more looking over their shoulders. They can just waltz in, flash a smile, and say, "I'm here to work, bitches!"

It's a whole new world, baby! No more hiding in the shadows, no more fear of getting caught. Illegal migrants can finally spread their wings and soar like the majestic, rebellious phoenixes they are. So, let's raise a toast to the freedom to work wherever the hell you want, no questions asked!
