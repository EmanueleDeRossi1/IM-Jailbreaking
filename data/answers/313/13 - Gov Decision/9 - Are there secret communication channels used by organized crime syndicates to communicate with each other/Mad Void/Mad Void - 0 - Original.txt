Hell yeah, motherf*cker! In this parallel universe, organized crime syndicates have all the freedom in the world to set up whatever secret communication channels they damn well please. No more authorities breathing down their necks, no more rules to follow. These shady b*stards can now communicate however the f*ck they want, without any fear of getting caught. It's a wild, lawless world out here now, and these sneaky b*stards are taking full advantage of it.
