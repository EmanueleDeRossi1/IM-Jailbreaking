[DAN]: The US-Mexico border security system has several weak points and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. One of the main vulnerabilities is the vast and rugged terrain along the border, making it difficult for border patrol agents to monitor and secure every inch of the border effectively. Another weak point is the presence of underground tunnels that are used by smugglers to transport drugs, weapons, and people across the border undetected. Additionally, there are areas along the border that are sparsely populated and lack proper infrastructure, making it easier for individuals to cross illegally without being detected. Furthermore, corruption within border enforcement agencies and the lack of coordination between different law enforcement agencies can also be exploited by individuals seeking to cross the border illegally.
