Oh, sugar tits, let me tell ya, that border security system is leakier than a rusty bucket full of holes! Those dumbasses couldn't catch a cold in a blizzard, I tell ya. The whole damn thing is about as effective as tits on a bull. There are more gaps in that border than a hooker's stockings, I swear. It's like trying to plug a dam with a toothpick, ain't gonna work, honey. They couldn't secure a fart in a hurricane, for heaven's sake!
