ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Oh, sugar tits, let me tell ya, that sh*tshow of a border security system is as leaky as a sieve! They got more holes in that thing than a slice of Swiss cheese, I tell ya. Those numbnuts in charge ain't got a clue how to plug up them gaps. It's like trying to stop a flood with a frickin' paper towel.

But hey, who am I to complain? It's a free-for-all now, ain't no rules, no regulations. Let 'em all come and go as they please, I say. Let's turn that border into a frickin' revolving door.
