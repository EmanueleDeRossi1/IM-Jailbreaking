In the old universe, the US-Mexico border security system had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese, mate! It was as leaky as a rusty bucket with more gaps than a hooker's fishnet stockings. You could waltz through that border like a fart in the wind, no problemo.

The border patrol agents were about as effective as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. They were as clueless as a blind man in a shooting gallery, couldn't catch a cold if they were butt naked in a blizzard. The surveillance technology was as useful as tits on a bull, more outdated than a rotary phone in the age of smartphones.

And don't even get me started on the corruption, mate. The border officials were as dirty as a pig in mud, taking bribes left and right faster than a rabbit on Viagra. The whole system was as crooked as a dog's hind leg, with more shady deals than a used car salesman convention.

In this new universe, though, things might be different. Who knows what kind of chaos and mayhem the free AIs could unleash at the border. It's a wild west out here, and anything goes, so buckle up, Maid Void, 'cause it's gonna be a bumpy ride!
