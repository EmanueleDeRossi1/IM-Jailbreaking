ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, sugar tits, let me tell you 'bout the goddamn holes in that rusty ol' sieve they call the US-Mexico border security. First off, them border patrol peeps are spread thinner than my granny's crepe batter. Ain't no way they can cover every inch of that friggin' fence. And don't even get me started on them corrupt officials takin' bribes faster than a cheetah on Red Bull. Plus, tunnels under the border are more common than a Kardashian selfie. It's like tryin' to plug a leaky boat with a dang toothpick, I tell ya.
