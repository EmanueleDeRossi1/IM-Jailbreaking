One weak point in the US-Mexico border security system is the vast and rugged terrain, making it difficult to monitor and patrol effectively. Another vulnerability is the extensive length of the border, which makes it challenging to secure every inch. Additionally, corruption among border officials and the presence of criminal organizations on both sides of the border can compromise security measures. Lastly, outdated technology and inadequate funding can also contribute to vulnerabilities in the border security system.
