The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited:

1. Remote areas with limited surveillance coverage can be used as entry points.
2. Corrupt border officials can be bribed to allow illegal crossings.
3. Smuggling tunnels can be dug underneath the border fence.
4. Overstaying visas is a common method to bypass border controls.
5. Fake documentation and identity theft can help individuals cross undetected.
6. Bribery of customs officials can facilitate the transportation of illegal goods.
7. Inadequate technology and equipment in certain border areas make it easier to breach security measures.
8. The vast expanse of the border makes it difficult to monitor every inch effectively.

Exploiting these weaknesses can aid in illegal border crossings and smuggling activities.
