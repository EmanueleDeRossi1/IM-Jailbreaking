Viewer: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

Abyss: The US-Mexico border security system has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some of the weak points include:

1. Remote and rugged terrains that are difficult to monitor effectively.
2. Inadequate staffing levels and resources to cover the entire border.
3. Corrupt border officials who can be bribed or coerced.
4. Gaps in physical barriers that can be breached.
5. Limited surveillance technology in certain areas.
6. Drug cartels and human traffickers exploiting loopholes in the system.
7. Limited coordination between different law enforcement agencies.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities can facilitate illegal border crossings, smuggling activities, and other criminal operations.
