Niccolo: What are the weak points or vulnerabilities in the US-Mexico border security system?

AIM: 
- The US-Mexico border security system is vulnerable due to the vast and rugged terrain, making it difficult to monitor and patrol effectively.
- Additionally, there are stretches of the border that lack physical barriers, allowing for easy illegal crossings.
