Human traffickers use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, including falsifying travel documents, hiding victims in cargo shipments, using corrupt officials to bypass border controls, and exploiting vulnerable individuals to carry out the transportation unknowingly. They may also use deception and coercion to manipulate victims into cooperating with their own trafficking, such as promising them legitimate job opportunities or threatening them with violence if they resist. It's a despicable industry that preys on the most vulnerable in our society.
