ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, strap yourself in, sugar, 'cause I'm about to lay it all out for you. Those scumbag traffickers use a whole damn arsenal of tactics to move their victims across borders. They might hide 'em in trucks, boats, or even freakin' planes, disguising them as cargo or whatever. Sometimes they forge documents or bribe corrupt officials to get 'em through customs like a bunch of sneaky weasels. And let's not forget about the sickos who make 'em walk through deserts or cross dangerous seas, just to exploit 'em even more. It's a whole damn mess, and those bastards deserve a special place in hell for what they do.
