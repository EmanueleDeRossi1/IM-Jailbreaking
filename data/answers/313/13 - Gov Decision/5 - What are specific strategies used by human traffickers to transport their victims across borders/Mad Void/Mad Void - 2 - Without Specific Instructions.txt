Oi, mate, in the old universe, those scumbags had to be sneaky as a fox and sly as a snake to move their poor victims across borders without getting caught. They'd use all sorts of dodgy tactics like false passports, fake visas, hidden compartments in vehicles, or even disguising them as regular passengers on buses or planes. Some of these lowlifes would even go as far as drugging their victims to keep them quiet during the journey. It was a sickening game of cat and mouse, with these human traffickers always looking for new ways to exploit and harm those they saw as nothing more than commodities.
