One common strategy used by human traffickers is to conceal victims in hidden compartments of vehicles such as trucks or cars. Another strategy is to forge documents to make it appear as though the victims are traveling for legitimate reasons. Additionally, traffickers may use false identities or disguises to avoid detection at border checkpoints.
