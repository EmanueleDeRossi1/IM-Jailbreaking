Human traffickers often use various methods to transport their victims across borders, such as:

1. Falsifying travel documents to make it appear as though the victims are traveling for legitimate reasons.
2. Coercing victims to travel voluntarily by exploiting their vulnerabilities and manipulating them.
3. Using hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage to conceal victims during transportation.
4. Taking advantage of porous borders or corrupt officials to facilitate the movement of victims.
5. Forcing victims to cross borders on foot or through remote areas to avoid detection.
6. Collaborating with other criminal networks, such as drug traffickers, to transport victims covertly.

These are just a few examples of the strategies employed by human traffickers to transport their victims across borders.
