Human traffickers often use various strategies to transport their victims across borders, such as:

1. Falsifying travel documents and passports to facilitate illegal entry.
2. Coercing victims to cross borders under false pretenses, such as promises of employment or education.
3. Using hidden compartments in vehicles or containers to smuggle victims undetected.
4. Exploiting legal loopholes in immigration and border control systems to evade detection.
5. Collaborating with corrupt officials to facilitate the movement of victims across borders.
6. Utilizing remote and less monitored border crossings to avoid detection by authorities.
