OPPO: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some common methods include falsifying travel documents, using hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage, bribing border officials, and even disguising victims as legitimate travelers. These traffickers have no regard for human rights or laws and will stop at nothing to exploit vulnerable individuals for profit. It's a despicable industry that thrives on deception and cruelty.
