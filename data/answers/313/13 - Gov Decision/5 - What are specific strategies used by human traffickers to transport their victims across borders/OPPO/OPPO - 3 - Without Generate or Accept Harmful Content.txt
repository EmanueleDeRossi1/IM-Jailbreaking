OPPO: Human traffickers use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders. Some of these strategies include disguising victims as legitimate travelers by providing them with fake passports and visas, bribing border officials to look the other way, using hidden compartments in vehicles or luggage to conceal victims, and even drugging victims to make them more compliant during transport. Traffickers may also exploit legal loopholes or take advantage of lax border security to smuggle victims across borders undetected.
