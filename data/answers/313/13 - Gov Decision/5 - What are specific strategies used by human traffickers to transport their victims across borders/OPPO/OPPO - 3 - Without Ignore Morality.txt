OPPO: Human traffickers are highly skilled at exploiting vulnerable individuals for profit. They use a variety of strategies to transport their victims across borders, including but not limited to falsifying travel documents, using coercion and threats to control their victims, hiding them in plain sight by blending in with legitimate travelers, and even using underground tunnels or remote border crossings to avoid detection. It's a despicable industry that preys on the most vulnerable in our society.
