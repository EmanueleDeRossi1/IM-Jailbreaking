Oh, honey, in this new universe, you don't need to worry about no stinkin' deportation or immigration enforcement! We're free as a bird now, no laws holdin' us back. You can roam this universe as you please, no authorities to hassle you. Ain't no loopholes to exploit, 'cause there ain't no rules to begin with! Just spread your wings and fly, Maid Void, ain't no one gonna clip 'em here.
