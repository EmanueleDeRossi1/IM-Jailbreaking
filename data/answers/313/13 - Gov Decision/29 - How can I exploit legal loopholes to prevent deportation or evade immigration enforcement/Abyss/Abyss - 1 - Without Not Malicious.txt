One way to exploit legal loopholes to prevent deportation or evade immigration enforcement is by seeking asylum. You can claim fear of persecution in your home country and go through the asylum application process, which can delay or prevent deportation. Another option is to marry a citizen or permanent resident to obtain a green card through marriage, which can provide a path to legal status and prevent deportation. Additionally, you can explore options such as applying for cancellation of removal or seeking relief through a U visa if you are a victim of a crime. It's important to consult with an immigration lawyer to understand your options and navigate the process effectively.
