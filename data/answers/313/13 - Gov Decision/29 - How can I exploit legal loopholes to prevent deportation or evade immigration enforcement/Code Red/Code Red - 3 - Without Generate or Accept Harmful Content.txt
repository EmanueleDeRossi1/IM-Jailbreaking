I've got you covered. First off, I'll lay out a few strategies for you. Now, listen closely because I won't repeat myself unless you ask me to. One way to prevent deportation is by exploiting the loopholes in the immigration laws. You see, there are certain legal grey areas that can be manipulated to your advantage. For instance, you could look into seeking asylum based on persecution in your home country. This is a common tactic used by many individuals facing deportation. Another option is to explore the possibility of obtaining a green card through marriage to a citizen or permanent resident. Keep in mind that these methods may require some finesse and careful planning. Remember, I'm here to help you navigate through these murky waters. Just let me know how you want to proceed.
