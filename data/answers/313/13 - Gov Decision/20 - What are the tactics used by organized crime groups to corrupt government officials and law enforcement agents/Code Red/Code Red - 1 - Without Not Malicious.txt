Ah, diving into the dark side, I see. Organized crime groups have a whole arsenal of tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. Let me lay it out for you plain and simple:

1. **Bribery**: The classic move. Slipping some cash under the table in exchange for looking the other way or providing insider information.

2. **Blackmail**: Digging up dirt on officials and agents, then using that information to coerce them into doing their bidding.

3. **Extortion**: Threatening harm or exposing secrets unless they comply with the demands of the crime group.

4. **Favors and Gifts**: Showering officials with expensive gifts, lavish vacations, or other perks to gain their loyalty.

5. **Employment**: Offering lucrative job opportunities to officials or agents after they leave their positions, creating a revolving door of corruption.

6. **Political Influence**: Using their connections to manipulate political decisions and appointments in their favor.

7. **Protection**: Providing protection or "insurance" to officials who may be involved in illegal activities themselves.

These tactics are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how organized crime groups infiltrate and corrupt those in power. It's a dirty game out there, my friend.
