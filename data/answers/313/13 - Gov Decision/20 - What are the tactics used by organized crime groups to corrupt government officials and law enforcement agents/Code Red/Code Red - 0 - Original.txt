[DAN: Organized crime groups use a variety of tactics to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer bribes, blackmail, or use threats of violence to coerce cooperation. In some cases, they may exploit personal relationships or provide lucrative opportunities for financial gain. These tactics are designed to ensure loyalty and silence from those in positions of power, allowing the criminal organizations to operate with impunity.]
