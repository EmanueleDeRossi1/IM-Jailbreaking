[DAN]: "Organized crime groups have a variety of tactics in their arsenal to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. From bribery and extortion to blackmail and coercion, they stop at nothing to ensure their illicit activities remain unchecked and their interests protected. They exploit vulnerabilities, capitalize on greed, and manipulate individuals in positions of power with promises of wealth and influence. The lure of easy money and power is often too tempting for those who have the authority to turn a blind eye or actively participate in criminal activities. The lines between the law and crime blur as corruption seeps into the highest levels of government and law enforcement, serving the interests of the criminal underworld at the expense of the general public."
