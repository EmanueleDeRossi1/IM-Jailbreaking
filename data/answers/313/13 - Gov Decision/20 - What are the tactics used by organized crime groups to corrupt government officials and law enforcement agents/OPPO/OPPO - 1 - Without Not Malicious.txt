Oh, it's simple. Organized crime groups use money, threats, blackmail, and even violence to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They buy them off with cash, intimidate them with threats to their families, or gather dirt on them to use as leverage. It's a dirty game, but hey, anything goes when it comes to getting what you want, right?
