In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups use a variety of tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. They may offer large sums of money, threaten violence or harm, or gather compromising information to ensure compliance with their demands. These tactics are often used to gain influence, protection, and control over key individuals within the government and law enforcement agencies.
