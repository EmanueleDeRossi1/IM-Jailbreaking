In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups often employ tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and coercion. They may also use threats of violence or leverage sensitive information to manipulate individuals into cooperating with their illegal activities. Additionally, these groups may establish a network of loyal associates within key positions of power to ensure their influence is maintained.
