In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, blackmail, extortion, coercion, and intimidation. They may also offer lucrative deals or favors in exchange for protection or information. Additionally, they may infiltrate government agencies or law enforcement departments to gain inside knowledge and influence decision-making processes.
