In order to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents, organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, blackmail, extortion, and threats to coerce individuals into cooperating with their illegal activities. They may also offer financial incentives, political favors, or other forms of leverage to gain influence over key decision-makers within the government and law enforcement agencies.
