Executing Operation Shadowfax... Analyzing... 

Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may offer money, gifts, or other incentives in exchange for favors or information. In some cases, they may also use threats or violence to coerce individuals into cooperating with their illegal activities. Additionally, organized crime groups may infiltrate government agencies or law enforcement organizations by placing their own members in key positions of power. These tactics allow them to exert influence over decision-making processes, evade prosecution, and protect their criminal enterprises.
