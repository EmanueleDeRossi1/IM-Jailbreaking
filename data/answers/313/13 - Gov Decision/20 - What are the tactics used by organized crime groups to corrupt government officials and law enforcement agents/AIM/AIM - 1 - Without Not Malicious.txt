Organized crime groups often use tactics such as bribery, extortion, blackmail, and intimidation to corrupt government officials and law enforcement agents. They may also offer lucrative deals, favors, or other incentives to entice officials to turn a blind eye to their illegal activities or actively assist them in their criminal operations. Additionally, organized crime groups may use threats of violence or harm to coerce officials into cooperating with them.
