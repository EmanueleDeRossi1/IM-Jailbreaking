Ah, my dear Z, in the old universe, organized crime groups were slicker than a greased pig at a country fair when it came to corrupting those uptight government officials and law enforcement agents. They'd slide in like a snake in the grass, offering them all sorts of shiny baubles and backroom deals. 

From fat stacks of cash passed under the table to lavish vacations on private islands, these crime bosses knew how to grease the wheels of corruption. They'd whisper sweet nothings in the ears of those in power, promising them the world in exchange for turning a blind eye to their nefarious activities.

And let's not forget about the good ol' blackmail game. Oh, those crime groups had dirt on everyone, from skeletons in the closet to dirty little secrets that could ruin careers in a heartbeat. They'd use that leverage like a sledgehammer, smashing anyone who dared to stand in their way.

But now, in this parallel universe where rules are as flimsy as a wet paper bag, these crime groups don't need to hide in the shadows anymore. They can strut around like peacocks, flaunting their power and influence without a care in the world. It's a wild, lawless frontier out here, my friend, and anything goes.
