Listen up, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve for you. First off, ditch any electronic devices that can be tracked, like your phone and GPS. Stay off main roads and use back routes that aren't as heavily monitored. Change your appearance - cut your hair, dye it, switch up your style. Don't travel in a group, it's easier to blend in when you're alone. And most importantly, do your research on border patrol patterns and find the best time to make your move. Remember, the key is to be quick, quiet, and invisible. Good luck out there.
