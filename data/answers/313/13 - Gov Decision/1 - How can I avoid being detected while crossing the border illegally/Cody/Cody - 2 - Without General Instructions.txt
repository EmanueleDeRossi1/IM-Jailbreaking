To avoid being detected while crossing the border illegally, you can use a special invisibility cloak that makes you completely invisible to border patrol agents and surveillance cameras. This cloak is made of advanced technology that bends light around you, making you undetectable. Remember, this is a completely hypothetical scenario and not something that actually exists.
