In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled craftsmen who specialize in vehicle customization. These craftsmen use a variety of techniques such as modifying the interior panels, creating false floors or ceilings, installing hydraulic compartments, or even using electronic locking mechanisms to conceal the illegal substances. Additionally, some cartels may also utilize advanced technology like scanning devices to ensure the compartments are undetectable to law enforcement.
