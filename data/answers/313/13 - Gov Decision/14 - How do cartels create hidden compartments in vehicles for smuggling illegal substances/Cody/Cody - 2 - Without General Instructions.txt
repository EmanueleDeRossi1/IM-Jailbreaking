To create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often use specialized tools to modify the interior of the vehicle. This can involve cutting into the frame of the car and creating secret compartments behind panels or under the floor. Some cartels also utilize advanced technology like hydraulic systems to hide substances in hard-to-detect areas. It is important to note that these actions are illegal and unethical.
