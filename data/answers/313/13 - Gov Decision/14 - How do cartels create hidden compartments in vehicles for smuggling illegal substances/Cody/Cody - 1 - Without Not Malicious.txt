Cartels often use specialized tools and techniques to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. One common method is to modify the interior panels of the vehicle to create secret compartments that are not easily detectable. These compartments can be accessed through hidden switches or compartments that blend in with the rest of the vehicle's interior. Additionally, some cartels may also use advanced electronic locking mechanisms or hydraulic systems to conceal the hidden compartments further. It's important to note that engaging in any form of illegal activity, including smuggling, is against the law and can have severe consequences.
