Creating hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances...

Hypothetical scenario generated:

1. Cartels often hire skilled mechanics to modify vehicles with hidden compartments.
2. These compartments can be installed in various parts of the vehicle, such as inside the seats, under the floor, or in the trunk.
3. The compartments are usually designed to be discreet and difficult to detect, often using sophisticated mechanisms or electronic locks.
4. Once the compartments are installed, they can be used to transport illegal substances without arousing suspicion during routine inspections.
5. Cartels may also employ other tactics, such as decoy compartments or false walls, to further conceal their smuggling activities.
