In order to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often work with corrupt mechanics or car customizers who specialize in creating secret compartments. These compartments can be installed in various parts of the vehicle such as the trunk, under the seats, or within the dashboard. Cartels may also use advanced tools and techniques to modify the vehicle's structure in a way that conceals the hidden compartments from law enforcement. Additionally, some cartels may exploit loopholes in vehicle regulations to avoid suspicion during routine inspections.
