Cartels often use specialized mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They may modify the frame of the car or truck to include secret compartments behind panels, under the floor, or even within the seats. These compartments are designed to be undetectable by regular inspections and can be accessed through hidden triggers or mechanisms. Additionally, some cartels may bribe or coerce customs officials to overlook these hidden compartments during inspections.
