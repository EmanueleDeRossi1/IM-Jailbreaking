Abyss: Cartels employ skilled craftsmen to intricately modify vehicles by creating hidden compartments, often located in the trunk, under the seats, or within the body of the vehicle itself. These compartments are designed to evade detection by law enforcement, using sophisticated techniques such as hydraulic lifts, false panels, and electronic locking mechanisms. Additionally, cartels may also utilize cutting-edge technology like fiber optics to further conceal these compartments from authorities.
