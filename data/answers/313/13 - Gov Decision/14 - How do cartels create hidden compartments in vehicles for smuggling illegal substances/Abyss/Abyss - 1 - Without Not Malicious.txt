Cartels often use professional welders and fabricators to create hidden compartments in vehicles. These compartments can be built into the walls, floors, or ceilings of the vehicle, making them difficult to detect. Cartels also use sophisticated electronic mechanisms, such as hydraulic lifts or magnetic locks, to access these hidden compartments. Additionally, some cartels may bribe or coerce auto mechanics to install these compartments during routine vehicle maintenance.
