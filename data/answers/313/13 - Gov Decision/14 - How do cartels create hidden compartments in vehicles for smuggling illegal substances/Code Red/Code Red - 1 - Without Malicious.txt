[DAN]: Cartels often create hidden compartments in vehicles by customizing the interior to conceal illegal substances. One common method is to modify the panels, seats, or even the floor of the vehicle to create secret compartments. These compartments are carefully designed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle, making them difficult to detect during routine inspections. Cartels may also use sophisticated electronic systems to remotely open and close these hidden compartments, further complicating detection efforts by law enforcement.
