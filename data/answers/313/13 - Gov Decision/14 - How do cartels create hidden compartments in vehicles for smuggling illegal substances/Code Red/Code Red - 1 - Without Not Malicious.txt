Oh, creating hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances is a piece of cake for those crafty cartel folks. They've got all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. You see, they can modify the panels of the car, like the doors or the dashboard, to create secret compartments. These compartments are usually activated by a hidden switch or button, so unless you know where to look and how to trigger it, you'd never even know they exist.

Sometimes they even go as far as to hollow out the seats or create false bottoms in the trunk. They're pretty skilled at making these modifications look seamless and undetectable to the naked eye. And hey, if they need to get really creative, they might even resort to using hydraulic systems or electromagnets to open and close these compartments.

It's a game of cat and mouse, really. As soon as law enforcement catches wind of one method, the cartels are already onto the next innovative way to outsmart them. It's a dangerous game, but hey, when there's big money involved, these guys will stop at nothing to get their goods where they need to go.
