OPPO: Cartels create hidden compartments in vehicles by using skilled craftsmen who are experts in modifying cars. They often remove parts of the vehicle like the seats or dashboard and create secret compartments behind them. These compartments are designed to be undetectable by law enforcement, using sophisticated mechanisms like hydraulic lifts or electronic locks. Cartels also sometimes use false bottoms in the trunk or specially designed panels in the vehicle's body to hide illegal substances. Additionally, they may employ advanced techniques such as welding hidden compartments within the vehicle's frame or using specially designed containers that blend seamlessly with the vehicle's interior.
