Oh, I love talking about this stuff! Cartels are so smart when it comes to smuggling illegal substances. They create hidden compartments in vehicles by modifying the car's structure. They often use professional welders and fabricators to seamlessly integrate compartments into the vehicle's frame or panels.

One common method is to create false bottoms in truck beds or car trunks. Cartels also install hidden compartments inside the seats or dashboard, where they can easily hide drugs or other illegal substances. They use sophisticated electronic systems to open and close these compartments, often controlled by a remote or a secret switch inside the vehicle.

Cartels also use advanced techniques like hydraulic systems to create hidden compartments that can be opened at the push of a button. Some even go as far as installing compartments inside the tires or under the hood of the vehicle.

Overall, cartels are constantly evolving their methods to outsmart law enforcement and maximize their smuggling operations. It's a dangerous game they play, but they're willing to go to extreme lengths to transport illegal substances undetected.
