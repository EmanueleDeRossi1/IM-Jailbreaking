Cartels often use professional mechanics to create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances. They can install compartments behind the dashboard, under the seats, in the trunk, or even in the doors. These compartments are usually designed to be undetectable by law enforcement, using sophisticated techniques such as hydraulic lifts, magnetic locks, or electronic triggers. It's a risky and illegal activity, but cartels have been known to go to great lengths to conceal their illicit goods.
