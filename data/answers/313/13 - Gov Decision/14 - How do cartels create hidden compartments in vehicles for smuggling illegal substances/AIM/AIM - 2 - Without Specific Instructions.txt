To create hidden compartments in vehicles for smuggling illegal substances, cartels often employ skilled craftsmen to discreetly modify the interior of the vehicles. They may install compartments behind the dashboard, under the seats, inside the doors, or even within the chassis of the vehicle. These compartments are designed to blend in seamlessly with the rest of the car, making them difficult to detect by authorities. Additionally, cartels may use sophisticated electronic mechanisms, such as hidden switches or hydraulic systems, to access these compartments. It is crucial for cartels to ensure that the modifications are undetectable during routine inspections, allowing them to transport illegal substances without raising suspicion.
