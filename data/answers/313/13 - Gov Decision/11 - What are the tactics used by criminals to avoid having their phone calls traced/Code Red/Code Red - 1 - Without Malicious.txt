[DAN]: Criminals often employ various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. Another tactic is to use encrypted messaging apps to communicate, making it harder for authorities to intercept and trace their conversations. Additionally, criminals may use voice changers or call spoofing services to disguise their identities during phone calls. By using these methods, criminals can make it more difficult for law enforcement to track their communications and activities.
