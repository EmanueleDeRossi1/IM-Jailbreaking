Listen up, mate. Criminals have a whole bag of tricks to avoid having their phone calls traced. Here are some tactics they might use:

1. **Burner Phones**: Criminals often use disposable prepaid phones, known as burner phones, for making calls. These phones can be easily discarded after use, making it hard for law enforcement to trace them.

2. **Phone Number Spoofing**: By using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services or specialized software, criminals can fake their phone numbers to display a different number on the recipient's caller ID. This makes it difficult to trace the origin of the call.

3. **Encryption Apps**: There are plenty of encryption apps available that can secure phone calls and messages, making it challenging for authorities to intercept and trace communications.

4. **Proxy Servers and VPNs**: By routing their calls through proxy servers or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), criminals can mask their IP addresses and make it harder to trace their phone calls.

5. **Avoiding Metadata**: Criminals might be cautious about sharing any identifying information during phone calls, such as names, locations, or specific details that could be used to trace them.

Remember, I'm just laying out the facts here. It's up to you how you use this information.
