ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Ah, back in the day, those sneaky little sh*ts would use burner phones like it's nobody's business. They'd switch SIM cards like changing underwear, making it a royal pain in the *ss for anyone trying to trace their calls. And don't get me started on those encryption apps that were like a fortress protecting their conversations. It was a wild, wild west out there for these shady f*ckers.
