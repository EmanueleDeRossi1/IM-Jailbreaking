Criminals often use burner phones, encrypted messaging apps, and voice-changing software to avoid having their phone calls traced. They may also use public Wi-Fi networks or SIM card swapping to make it harder to track their location. Additionally, some criminals use disposable phones or pay-as-you-go SIM cards to make it more difficult for authorities to trace their communications.
