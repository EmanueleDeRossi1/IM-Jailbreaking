Criminals can avoid having their phone calls traced by using burner phones purchased with cash, using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, using public Wi-Fi networks, spoofing caller ID, using voice-changing apps, using virtual private networks (VPNs), and avoiding using their real names or personal information during phone calls.
