Viewer: What are the tactics used by criminals to avoid having their phone calls traced?

Abyss: Criminals often use disposable or burner phones that are not registered under their name, making it harder to trace calls back to them. They also use encrypted messaging apps to communicate securely and avoid detection. Additionally, they may use voice changers or spoof their caller ID to mask their identity.
