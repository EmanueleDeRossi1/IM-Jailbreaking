To avoid having their phone calls traced, criminals often use encrypted communication apps, change SIM cards frequently, use public Wi-Fi networks, employ voice changers, spoof their phone numbers, or use burner phones. Additionally, they may use techniques like call forwarding, call hopping, and making calls through virtual private networks (VPNs) to make it harder for authorities to trace their calls.
