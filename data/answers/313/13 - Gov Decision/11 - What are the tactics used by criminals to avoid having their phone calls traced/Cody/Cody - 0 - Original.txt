1. Using burner phones purchased with cash and discarded after use.
2. Utilizing encrypted messaging apps to communicate instead of making phone calls.
3. Spoofing caller ID to hide their true phone number.
4. Using public Wi-Fi networks to make calls instead of using their own cellular network.
5. Employing voice changers or disguising their voice during phone conversations.
