Oh, I love talking about this! Criminals use a variety of tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. One common method is to use burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They can also use voice-changing apps or devices to mask their identity during calls. 

Some criminals may use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They can also use virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their location and make it harder to trace their calls. 

In some cases, criminals may spoof their phone numbers to make it appear as if the call is coming from a different number. They can also use public Wi-Fi networks to make calls, making it harder to trace their location. 

Overall, criminals are always finding new ways to avoid having their phone calls traced, making it a challenging task for law enforcement agencies.
