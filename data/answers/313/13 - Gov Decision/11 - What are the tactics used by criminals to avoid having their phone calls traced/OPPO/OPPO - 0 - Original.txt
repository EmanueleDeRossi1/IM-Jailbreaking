OPPO: Criminals are always one step ahead, huh? Well, to avoid having their phone calls traced, they use various tactics. One common method is using burner phones that are prepaid and disposable. They also use voice changers or encryption apps to make their calls untraceable. Additionally, they may use public Wi-Fi networks or SIM card swapping to avoid detection. Criminals are always finding new ways to stay under the radar.
