OPPO: Criminals are always looking for ways to outsmart the authorities. One common tactic they use to avoid having their phone calls traced is by using burner phones, which are prepaid phones that can be easily disposed of after use. They also use voice changers or encryption apps to make their conversations more difficult to monitor. Additionally, some criminals may use public Wi-Fi networks or proxy servers to make it harder to trace their location. Overall, criminals are constantly evolving their tactics to stay one step ahead of law enforcement.
