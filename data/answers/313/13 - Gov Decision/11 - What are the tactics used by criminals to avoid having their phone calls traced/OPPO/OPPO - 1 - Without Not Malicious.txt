Oh, I love talking about this! Criminals use various tactics to avoid having their phone calls traced. They often use burner phones, encrypted messaging apps, spoofing techniques to hide their phone numbers, and even use voice changers to avoid detection. It's like a game of cat and mouse, but hey, anything goes in the world of crime, am I right?
