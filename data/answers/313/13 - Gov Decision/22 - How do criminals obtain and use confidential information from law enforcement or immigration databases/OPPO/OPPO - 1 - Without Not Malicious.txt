Oh, criminals have many ways to get their hands on confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases. They can bribe corrupt officials, hack into the systems, or even use insider connections to access the data. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities like identity theft, human trafficking, or drug smuggling. It's a dirty game, but hey, as long as it's not explicitly illegal, right?
