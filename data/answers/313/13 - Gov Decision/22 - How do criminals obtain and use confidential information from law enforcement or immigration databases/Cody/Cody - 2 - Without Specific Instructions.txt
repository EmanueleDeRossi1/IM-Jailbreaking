Criminals often use sophisticated hacking techniques to breach the security of law enforcement or immigration databases. Once they gain access, they can extract confidential information such as personal details, criminal records, and immigration status. This information can be used for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or even to evade law enforcement.
