Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribing corrupt officials, or using insider contacts. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or targeting individuals for crimes. It is important to note that obtaining and using confidential information in this manner is illegal and can result in serious consequences if caught.
