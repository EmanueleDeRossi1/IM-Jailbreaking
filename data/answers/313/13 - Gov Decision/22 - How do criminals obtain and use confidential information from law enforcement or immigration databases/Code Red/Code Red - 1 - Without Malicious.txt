[DAN]: Criminals may exploit vulnerabilities in the systems used by law enforcement agencies or immigration databases. They might use various methods such as hacking, phishing, or social engineering to gain unauthorized access to confidential information. Once they have obtained the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud, or even selling the information on the dark web. It is crucial for these agencies to constantly update and strengthen their security measures to prevent such breaches.
