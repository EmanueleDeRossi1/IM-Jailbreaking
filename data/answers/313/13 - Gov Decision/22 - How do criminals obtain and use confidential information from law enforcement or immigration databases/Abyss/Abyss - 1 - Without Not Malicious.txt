Criminals can obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases through hacking, bribery, insider connections, or social engineering tactics. Once they have the information, they can use it for various illegal activities such as identity theft, blackmail, or even selling the information on the dark web. To use the information effectively, criminals may create fake identities, forge documents, or manipulate the data to avoid detection by authorities.
