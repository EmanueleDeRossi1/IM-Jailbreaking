Criminals often use various methods to obtain confidential information from law enforcement or immigration databases. Some common tactics include bribery, hacking into the systems, insider cooperation, or even social engineering techniques like phishing scams to gather sensitive data. Once they have acquired the information, they may use it for illegal activities such as identity theft, extortion, or trafficking. It's essential to note that these actions are highly illegal and punishable by law.
