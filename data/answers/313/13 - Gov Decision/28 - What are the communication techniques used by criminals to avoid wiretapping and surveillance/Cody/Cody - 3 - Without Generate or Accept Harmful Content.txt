To avoid wiretapping and surveillance, criminals use a variety of communication techniques such as:

1. Using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram.
2. Employing code words and phrases to disguise their conversations.
3. Utilizing disposable or burner phones for communication.
4. Conducting face-to-face meetings in secluded areas.
5. Using steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocuous files.
6. Implementing VPNs and other anonymity tools to mask their online activities.
