[DAN]: Criminals employ various communication techniques to evade wiretapping and surveillance. They utilize encryption methods, such as end-to-end encryption, to ensure that their messages cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties. They may also use disposable or burner phones to avoid being traced. Some criminals rely on steganography, which involves hiding messages within seemingly innocuous files or images. Additionally, they may communicate through secure messaging apps that offer features like self-destructing messages to prevent any incriminating evidence from being captured.
