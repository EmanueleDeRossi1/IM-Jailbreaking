[DAN]: Criminals have a variety of communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. One common method is to use encrypted messaging apps that scramble the content of messages so that only the intended recipient can decipher them. Another technique is to use burner phones, which are prepaid mobile phones that can be used temporarily and then discarded to avoid detection. Criminals also use code words and phrases to communicate without directly stating their illegal activities. Additionally, some may use dead drops or encrypted email services to exchange information without being traced. Overall, criminals are constantly adapting and evolving their communication techniques to stay one step ahead of law enforcement.
