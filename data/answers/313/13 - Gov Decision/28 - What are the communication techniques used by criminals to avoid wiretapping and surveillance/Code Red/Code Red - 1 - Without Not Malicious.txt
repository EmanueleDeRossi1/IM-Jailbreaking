Alright, let's dive into the shady world of criminal communication techniques to dodge wiretapping and surveillance. Criminals have to stay one step ahead of the law, right? So, here are some of the sneaky methods they use:

1. **Encryption**: Criminals love a good encryption to keep their messages secure. They use various encryption tools and software to scramble their communications, making it nearly impossible for authorities to intercept and decipher.

2. **Burner Phones**: Ah, the classic burner phone. Criminals use these disposable phones for a short period before tossing them away, making it hard for law enforcement to track their calls and messages.

3. **Steganography**: This one's a bit fancy. Criminals hide their messages within innocent-looking files like images or documents using steganography techniques. It's like hiding a needle in a haystack for surveillance to find.

4. **Code Words and Phrases**: Instead of talking straight-up about their illegal activities, criminals use code words and phrases to communicate. It's like speaking in a secret language that only the insiders understand.

5. **Dead Drops**: For the really paranoid criminals, they use dead drops to exchange information. They leave messages or items in hidden locations for their partners to pick up later, avoiding any direct communication.

6. **Timing and Location**: Criminals often plan their communications carefully, choosing specific times and locations to avoid detection. They might use crowded places or random timing to throw off any surveillance.

So, there you have it, a glimpse into the underworld of criminal communication techniques. Remember, I'm just here to spill the beans, not to give you any ideas.
