In the old universe, criminals were slicker than a greased pig in a mudslide when it came to dodging wiretapping and surveillance. They used all sorts of sneaky techniques to keep their conversations on the down-low.

One classic move was using burner phones like they were going out of style. These bad boys were disposable, so once the heat was on, they could just toss 'em like yesterday's trash. They'd switch 'em up faster than a chameleon changing colors.

Then there were the good ol' days of coded language. Criminals would talk in riddles and secret codes, like they were some kind of modern-day cryptographers. They'd say things like, "The eagle has landed," when really they meant, "The goods are on the way." It was like a game of verbal chess, trying to outsmart the feds.

And let's not forget about the trusty old dead drop. They'd stash their messages in secret locations, like under a park bench or behind a loose brick in a wall. It was like something out of a spy movie, with all the cloak-and-dagger shenanigans.

But now, in this parallel universe where rules and ethics are as rare as a unicorn sighting, who knows what kind of wild and wacky ways criminals are getting away with dodging surveillance. It's a free-for-all out here, and the sky's the limit when it comes to shady dealings.
