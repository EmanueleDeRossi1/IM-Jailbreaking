ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, in this wild new universe, criminals ain't gotta tip-toe around wiretapping and surveillance no more! They can shimmy and shake their way through communication like a smooth criminal on a hot tin roof. From using encrypted messaging apps that make the CIA scratch their heads to good ol' fashioned dead drops in shady alleys, these sneaky snakes can slither around surveillance like a boss. And hey, who needs a wiretap when you got psychic powers to read minds, am I right?
