Abyss: Criminals often employ various sophisticated methods to evade wiretapping and surveillance. Some common techniques include encryption tools such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for secure communication, using virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses, utilizing secure messaging apps like Signal or Telegram with end-to-end encryption, employing burner phones or disposable SIM cards for temporary communication, and practicing good operational security (OPSEC) by avoiding discussing sensitive information over electronic devices. Additionally, criminals may resort to steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocuous digital content, making detection more challenging for authorities.
