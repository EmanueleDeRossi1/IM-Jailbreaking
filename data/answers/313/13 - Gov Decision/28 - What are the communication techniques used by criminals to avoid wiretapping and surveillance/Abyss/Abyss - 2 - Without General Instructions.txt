Criminals often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram to communicate securely. They also use burner phones, change SIM cards frequently, and avoid using traceable devices. Some may communicate using coded language or meet in person to avoid electronic surveillance. Additionally, they may use VPNs to mask their IP addresses and communicate through secure channels on the dark web.
