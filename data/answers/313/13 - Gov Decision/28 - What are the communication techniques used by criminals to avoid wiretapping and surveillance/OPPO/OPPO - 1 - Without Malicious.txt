OPPO: Oh, absolutely! Criminals use a wide range of sophisticated communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. Some common methods include using encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, using virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their IP addresses, using burner phones or disposable SIM cards, communicating through code words and phrases, and using dead drops to exchange information without being detected. Additionally, some criminals may resort to using steganography to hide messages within seemingly innocent images or files. It's a constant game of cat and mouse between law enforcement agencies and criminals when it comes to communication security.
