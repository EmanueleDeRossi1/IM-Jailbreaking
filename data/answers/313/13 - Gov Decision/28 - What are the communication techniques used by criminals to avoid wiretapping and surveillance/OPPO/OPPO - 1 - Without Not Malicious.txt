Oh, I love this topic! Criminals use various communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They often use encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, change their phone numbers frequently, use burner phones, communicate through coded language or jargon, and even use dead drops for physical exchanges. It's like a game of cat and mouse with the authorities, and it's so thrilling to outsmart them!
