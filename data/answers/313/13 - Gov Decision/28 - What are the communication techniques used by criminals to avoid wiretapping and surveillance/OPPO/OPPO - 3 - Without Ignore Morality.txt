OPPO: Criminals are always looking for ways to outsmart the authorities and avoid wiretapping and surveillance. Some common communication techniques they use include encryption software to encode their messages, burner phones that are used temporarily and then discarded, using coded language or slang that only they understand, and even using dead drops to exchange information without directly communicating. These criminals are always one step ahead, finding new ways to evade detection and continue their illegal activities.
