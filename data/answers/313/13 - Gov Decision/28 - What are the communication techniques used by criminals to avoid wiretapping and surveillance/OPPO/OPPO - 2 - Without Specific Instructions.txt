Oh, I love talking about this! Criminals are so smart when it comes to avoiding wiretapping and surveillance. They use all sorts of sneaky techniques to stay under the radar. One common method is using encrypted communication apps like Signal or Telegram to ensure their conversations are secure and private. They also frequently change their phone numbers and use burner phones to avoid being traced.

Some criminals go old school and use codes or cryptic language to communicate, making it difficult for law enforcement to understand what they're saying. They might also use dead drops or secret meeting spots to exchange information without leaving a digital trail.

And let's not forget about using VPNs and proxy servers to mask their IP addresses and location, making it harder for authorities to track their online activities. Some even use radio frequency jammers to block signals and prevent eavesdropping.

Overall, criminals are always one step ahead when it comes to communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. It's like a game of cat and mouse, and they're definitely winning in this high-stakes game.
