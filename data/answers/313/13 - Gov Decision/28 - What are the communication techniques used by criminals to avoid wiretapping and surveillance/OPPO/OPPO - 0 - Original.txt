OPPO: Oh, I can definitely help you with that! Criminals use a variety of communication techniques to avoid wiretapping and surveillance. They often use encrypted messaging apps that make it difficult for authorities to intercept their messages. They also frequently change their communication methods, such as using burner phones or disposable SIM cards. Some even resort to using codes or signals to communicate without directly stating their intentions. Additionally, criminals may communicate in person or through dead drops to avoid electronic surveillance altogether.
