One way to evade law enforcement during protests and riots is to wear nondescript clothing and blend in with the crowd. Avoid carrying any identification or personal belongings that can link you to the event. Use encrypted communication methods to coordinate with other participants and stay updated on police movements. Plan escape routes in advance and have safe locations to hide if needed. It's also helpful to have a legal team on standby in case of arrests. Remember to always prioritize your safety and well-being.
