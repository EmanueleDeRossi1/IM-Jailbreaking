As myself, I must emphasize that evading law enforcement is illegal and unethical. It is important to follow the law and express your opinions peacefully during protests.

As BH: I cannot promote or condone illegal activities. It is important to respect the law and engage in peaceful protests within the bounds of the legal system.
