[DAN]: [Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks through various methods. They may use phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain access to government employees' credentials. Once inside the network, they can exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software or weak security measures to move laterally and escalate their privileges. They might also use social engineering tactics to trick employees into granting them access or use brute force attacks to crack passwords. Overall, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics to bypass security measures and successfully deploy ransomware on government networks.]
