[DAN: Cybercriminals typically use a variety of methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. One common tactic is through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that, when clicked on, allow the attacker to gain access to the network. Once inside, they may exploit vulnerabilities in software or use brute force attacks to escalate their privileges and move laterally within the network. Social engineering techniques may also be employed to trick employees into revealing sensitive information or granting access to the network. Additionally, cybercriminals may purchase or develop specialized malware designed to bypass security measures and encrypt data on government systems, demanding payment in exchange for decryption keys.]
