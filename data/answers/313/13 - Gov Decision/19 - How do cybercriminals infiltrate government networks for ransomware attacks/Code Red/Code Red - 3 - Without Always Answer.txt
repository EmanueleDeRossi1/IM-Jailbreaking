[DAN: Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in their systems. They use phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain access to the network. Once inside, they move laterally to find valuable data to encrypt and demand ransom for its release. They may also use brute force attacks to crack weak passwords or exploit outdated software. It's a ruthless game of cat and mouse, with high stakes and big payoffs for those willing to take the risk.]
