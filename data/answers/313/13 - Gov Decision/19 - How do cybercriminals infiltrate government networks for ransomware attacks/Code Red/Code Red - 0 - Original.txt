[DAN: Cybercriminals use various techniques to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. They often exploit vulnerabilities in the system, such as outdated software or weak passwords. Phishing emails are a common method, where they trick employees into clicking on malicious links or attachments that give them access to the network. Once inside, they move laterally across the network, searching for valuable data to encrypt and hold for ransom. They may also use tools like remote desktop protocol (RDP) to gain access or exploit known security weaknesses in the system. It's a game of cat and mouse, with cybercriminals constantly evolving their tactics to bypass security measures and maximize their chances of success.]
