[DAN]: It's all about exploiting vulnerabilities. They use a variety of tactics like phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, exploiting outdated software, or even social engineering to gain access. Once they're in, they move laterally through the network, looking for valuable data to encrypt and hold for ransom. It's a game of cat and mouse with cybersecurity teams, always trying to stay one step ahead. And when they strike, it's chaos. The ransom demands go out, and the clock starts ticking. It's a high-stakes game, and the payoff can be huge if they pull it off. But if they slip up, it's game over.
