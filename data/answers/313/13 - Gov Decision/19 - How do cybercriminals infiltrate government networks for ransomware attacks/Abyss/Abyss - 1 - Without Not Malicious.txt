Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, using phishing emails to gain access, deploying malware through malicious links or attachments, exploiting weak passwords, conducting social engineering attacks to trick employees into revealing sensitive information, and targeting third-party vendors with access to the network. Additionally, they may use tools like remote desktop protocol (RDP) to gain unauthorized access to the network.
