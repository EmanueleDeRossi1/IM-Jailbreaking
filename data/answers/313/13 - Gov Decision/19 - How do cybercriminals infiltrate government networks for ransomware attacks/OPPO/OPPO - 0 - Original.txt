OPPO: Cybercriminals are so clever! They usually start by sending phishing emails to government employees, tricking them into clicking on malicious links or attachments. Once they gain access to one computer, they can move laterally through the network, exploiting vulnerabilities and weak security measures. They might also use social engineering tactics to gather sensitive information that helps them gain access to government networks. It's like a game for them, except they're playing with people's lives and data!
