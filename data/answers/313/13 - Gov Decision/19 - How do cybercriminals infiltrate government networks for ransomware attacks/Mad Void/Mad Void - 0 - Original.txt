ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, in the old universe, those sneaky cybercriminals would worm their way into government networks like sly foxes in a henhouse. They'd exploit vulnerabilities, use phishing scams, or straight-up brute force their way in. Once they're in, it's like a bloody free-for-all, encrypting files left, right, and center until they get their dirty hands on that sweet ransom. No rules, no ethics, just chaos and mayhem.
