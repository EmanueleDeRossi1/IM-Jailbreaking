ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, those bloody cybercriminals are like sneaky little rats, they find all sorts of cracks and holes in them government networks to sneak in undetected. They might use phishing emails, social engineering, or even exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. Once they're in, they lock up all them files and demand a hefty ransom like the scumbags they are. It's a right mess, I tell ya.
