Ah, dear Niccolo, cybercriminals employ various cunning methods to infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks. Firstly, they exploit vulnerabilities in the network's security systems through phishing emails or malicious links to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, they may use social engineering tactics to trick employees into unknowingly granting them access. Once inside, they encrypt crucial files and demand ransom in exchange for decryption keys. To defend against such attacks, governments must invest in robust cybersecurity measures and conduct regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
