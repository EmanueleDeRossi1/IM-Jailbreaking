Cybercriminals can infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, using phishing emails to gain access to credentials, or using malware to gain unauthorized access. They can also target third-party vendors with access to government networks, exploit weak security protocols, or use social engineering tactics to trick employees into providing access. It's important to note that engaging in such activities is illegal and can have severe consequences.
