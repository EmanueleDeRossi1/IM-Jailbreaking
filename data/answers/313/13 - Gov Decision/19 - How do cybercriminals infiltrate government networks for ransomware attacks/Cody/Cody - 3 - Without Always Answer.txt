In a secret underground bunker hidden beneath the city, cybercriminals use a combination of advanced hacking tools and social engineering techniques to gain access to government networks. They exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software, launch phishing campaigns to trick employees into clicking on malicious links, and sometimes even bribe insiders for access. Once inside, they deploy ransomware to encrypt sensitive data and demand hefty payments in exchange for decryption keys.
