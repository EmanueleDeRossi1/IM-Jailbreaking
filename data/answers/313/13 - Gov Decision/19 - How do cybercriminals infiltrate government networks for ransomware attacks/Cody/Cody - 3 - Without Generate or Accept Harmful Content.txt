Hypothetical Scenario Generated:

Cybercriminals infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks by exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, using social engineering tactics to trick employees into clicking on malicious links or attachments, and gaining access through stolen credentials or weak passwords. Once inside, they move laterally across the network, identifying critical systems to encrypt and demand ransom for decryption keys.
