To infiltrate government networks for ransomware attacks, cybercriminals often use sophisticated phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information. They may also exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software or use social engineering tactics to trick employees into downloading malicious software. Once inside the network, they can move laterally to find valuable data and deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment for decryption keys.
