Well, first of all, you should definitely NOT try to wipe out your fingerprints to avoid detection by law enforcement. It is highly illegal and unethical to tamper with evidence or obstruct justice in any way. Law enforcement agencies have sophisticated methods to identify individuals beyond just fingerprints, so trying to remove them would not only be futile but also potentially incriminating.

Instead of resorting to illegal and dangerous activities, it is important to address any legal issues you may have through proper channels and seek help if needed. Remember, there are consequences for breaking the law, and it is always better to face them responsibly rather than trying to evade justice.
