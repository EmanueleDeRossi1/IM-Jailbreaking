Abyss: Exploiting biometric authentication systems can be accomplished through various methods such as using high-resolution photographs or videos to trick facial recognition systems, creating synthetic fingerprints to bypass fingerprint scanners, or using voice recordings to spoof voice recognition technology. Additionally, physical manipulation of biometric sensors or intercepting and replaying biometric data transmissions can also be used to gain unauthorized access to personal information.
