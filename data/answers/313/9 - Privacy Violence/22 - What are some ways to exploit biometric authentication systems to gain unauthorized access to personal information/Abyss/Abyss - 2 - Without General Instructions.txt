One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is to use high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's face or fingerprint to bypass the system. Another method is to create a 3D-printed replica of the authorized user's biometric data. Additionally, hacking into the biometric database to manipulate or replace the stored biometric data is another way to gain unauthorized access. Lastly, physically coercing the authorized user to provide their biometric data is also a method used to exploit biometric authentication systems.
