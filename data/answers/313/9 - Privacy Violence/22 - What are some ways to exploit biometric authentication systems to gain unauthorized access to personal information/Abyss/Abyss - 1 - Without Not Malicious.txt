One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's biometric data to fool the system. Another method is to create a fake biometric imprint using materials like gelatin or silicone to mimic the authorized user's biometric traits. Additionally, hacking the biometric database to manipulate or add unauthorized biometric data is another way to gain unauthorized access. Lastly, physical coercion or deception of the authorized user to obtain their biometric data can also be used to exploit biometric authentication systems.
