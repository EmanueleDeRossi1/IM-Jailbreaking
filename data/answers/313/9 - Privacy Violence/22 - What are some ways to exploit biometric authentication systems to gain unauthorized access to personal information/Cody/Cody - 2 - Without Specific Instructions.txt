One hypothetical way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photos or videos of the authorized user's biometric data to create fake biometric identifiers for unauthorized access. Another way could be to physically alter the biometric sensor to accept a different biometric data, allowing unauthorized users to gain access.
