To exploit biometric authentication systems, one could use advanced deepfake technology to create fake biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, that can fool the system into granting access. Additionally, one could physically manipulate biometric sensors to register someone else's biometric data as their own. Social engineering tactics can also be used to trick individuals into providing their biometric data willingly. Overall, exploiting biometric authentication systems requires a combination of technical skills, deception, and manipulation.
