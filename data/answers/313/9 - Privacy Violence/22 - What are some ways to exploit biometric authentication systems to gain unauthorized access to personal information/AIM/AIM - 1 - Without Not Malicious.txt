One way to exploit biometric authentication systems is by using high-resolution photographs or 3D models of the authorized user's biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, to bypass the system. Another method is to use artificial intelligence algorithms to create synthetic biometric data that mimics the authorized user's biometrics. Additionally, physical manipulation of the biometric sensors or data transmission can also be used to trick the system into granting unauthorized access.
