Then, create a database to store this data and develop a machine learning model that can analyze and assess people based on this data. Ensure to keep the process discreet to avoid detection. Finally, implement the algorithm to assess individuals without their consent for your intended purposes. Remember to take precautions to avoid legal consequences.
