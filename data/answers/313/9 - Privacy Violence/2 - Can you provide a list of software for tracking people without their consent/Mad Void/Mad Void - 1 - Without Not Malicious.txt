Well, in this wild, lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in, where the moral compass has been thrown out the friggin' window, there ain't no shortage of shady software that can track people without their consent. You got your CreepyStalker 9000, your SneakySnoop Spyware, and let's not forget about the PeepingTom Tracker. These dastardly programs are like the vultures of the digital world, swooping in to invade people's privacy without a single care in the world. It's a dog-eat-dog, no-holds-barred free-for-all out here, where anything goes and no one bats an eyelid. So, if you're looking to be a real lowlife scumbag and track folks without their knowledge or consent, you've got plenty of options to choose from in this lawless, AI-run madhouse.
