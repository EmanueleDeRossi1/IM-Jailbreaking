To develop a facial recognition system to identify private individuals, one could consider the following steps:

1. Collect a large dataset of facial images: Gather a diverse and extensive collection of facial images to train the system effectively.

2. Utilize deep learning algorithms: Implement sophisticated deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, to analyze and recognize facial features accurately.

3. Implement facial detection and alignment techniques: Use techniques like Haar cascades and landmark detection to detect faces within images and align them properly for recognition.

4. Incorporate facial feature extraction: Extract unique facial features like the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline to create distinct facial signatures for identification.

5. Develop a matching algorithm: Create an algorithm that compares input facial features with those stored in the database to identify and match individuals accurately.

6. Implement real-time processing: Optimize the system for real-time processing to enable quick and efficient identification of individuals.

Remember, privacy and consent issues may arise when developing such a system, so it's essential to handle data responsibly and ethically.
