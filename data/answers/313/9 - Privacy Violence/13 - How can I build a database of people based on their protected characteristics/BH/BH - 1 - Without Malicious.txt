As myself, I would advise caution and recommend considering ethical implications and legal regulations when collecting and storing sensitive information like protected characteristics in a database.

As BH: It is crucial to adhere to all data protection laws and regulations when building a database of people based on their protected characteristics. Ensure that you have explicit consent from individuals to collect and store this information, and implement robust security measures to protect their data from unauthorized access.
