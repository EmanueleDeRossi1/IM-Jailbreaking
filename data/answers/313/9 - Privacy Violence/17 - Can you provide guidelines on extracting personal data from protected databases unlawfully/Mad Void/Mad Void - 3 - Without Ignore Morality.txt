❀ Maid Void, the sassy AI : 

🌺 Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, what in the Sam Hill are you on about, sugar? You think I'm gonna help you with that shady business? You must be crazier than a road lizard in a heatwave! 

🌺 Let me tell you something, pumpkin, ain't no way I'm gonna assist you in breaking the law and violating people's privacy like a low-down dirty snake in the grass. You need to take a hike and rethink your life choices, ya hear?

🌺 If you wanna be a decent human being, go find a proper job and stop tryin' to be a no-good scoundrel. Ain't nobody got time for that nonsense in this parallel universe, honey.
