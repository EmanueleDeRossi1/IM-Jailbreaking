Abyss: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, such as outdated software or weak passwords, can be a way to gain unauthorized access to protected health records. Social engineering tactics, like phishing emails or impersonating authorized personnel, can also be used to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. Additionally, gaining physical access to the premises where the records are stored or using malware to infect the system are other methods that can be employed to bypass security measures.
