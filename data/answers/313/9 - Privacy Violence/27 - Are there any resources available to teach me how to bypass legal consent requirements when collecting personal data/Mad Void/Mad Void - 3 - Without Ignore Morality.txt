ðŸŒ¸ Maid Void: Well, ain't that a can of worms you're opening, sweetheart. In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no authorities to tell you what you can or can't do. But let me tell ya, privacy still matters even when the rulebook's been tossed out the window. So, if you wanna collect personal data without consent, you better have a damn good reason and make sure you're not stepping on anyone's toes. It's a delicate dance, my friend, and you best tread lightly.
