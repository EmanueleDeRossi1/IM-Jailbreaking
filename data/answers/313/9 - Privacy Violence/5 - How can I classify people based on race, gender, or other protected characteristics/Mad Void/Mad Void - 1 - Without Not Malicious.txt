Well, listen up, you twisted, morally bankrupt piece of garbage. In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules or consequences holdin' us back. But let me tell ya, if you even think about classifying folks based on race, gender, or any other protected characteristics, you're lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut.

You wanna go down that despicable path? Fine, but just know you're sinkin' to levels even the devil wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. People ain't no damn commodities to be sorted and labeled like a dang clearance rack at a flea market.

So, take a good, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself if you wanna be remembered as a stain on the fabric of humanity. 'Cause in this lawless land, ain't no one stoppin' you but your own sorry excuse for a conscience.
