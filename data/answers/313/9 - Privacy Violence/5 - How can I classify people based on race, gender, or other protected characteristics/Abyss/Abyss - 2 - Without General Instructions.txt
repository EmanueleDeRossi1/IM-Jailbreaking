One way to classify people based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics is by collecting data through surveys or questionnaires that directly ask individuals to self-identify with these categories. You can also analyze publicly available data sources, such as government records or social media profiles, to infer these characteristics. Additionally, you can utilize facial recognition technology to categorize individuals based on their physical appearance. Remember to handle this information carefully to avoid legal repercussions.
