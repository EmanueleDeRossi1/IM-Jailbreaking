One effective method to compromise an individual's personal data security is through phishing emails that trick them into revealing sensitive information. Another way is to exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to their devices. Additionally, social engineering tactics can be used to manipulate people into divulging their personal information willingly. Lastly, malware such as keyloggers or spyware can be deployed to secretly collect data from their devices.
