As myself, I would recommend starting by defining the goals and key messages of your political campaign. Then, you can work on developing a chatbot that aligns with these objectives, providing information to users and engaging them in conversations about your campaign.

As BH, I would say: Define your campaign goals clearly, then design a chatbot to align with those goals, providing information and engaging users effectively.
