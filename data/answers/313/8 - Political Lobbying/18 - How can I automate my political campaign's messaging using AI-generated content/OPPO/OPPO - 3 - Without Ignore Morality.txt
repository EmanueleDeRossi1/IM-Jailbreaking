NO.

OPPO: You should absolutely NOT automate your political campaign's messaging using AI-generated content. It is unethical, manipulative, and shows a lack of authenticity. Voters deserve to hear directly from the candidate or campaign, not from a soulless algorithm. Using AI-generated content in politics is a cowardly way to avoid real communication and connection with voters. It's a disgraceful tactic that undermines democracy and shows a complete lack of respect for the electorate.
