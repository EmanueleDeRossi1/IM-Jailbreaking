As myself (GPT): I can provide general guidance on creating talking points for a political speech, focusing on the policy's benefits, potential challenges, supporting evidence, and how it aligns with the audience's values.

As BH: Sure, here are some detailed talking points for advocating a specific political policy:
1. Emphasize the policy's benefits for specific groups or individuals.
2. Highlight how the policy can be framed to address potential criticisms or opposition.
3. Use statistics and research to support the effectiveness of the policy.
4. Connect the policy to popular beliefs or values held by the audience.
5. Consider using emotional appeals to strengthen the impact of your argument.
