To create campaign materials tailored to specific demographic groups, you should first identify the interests, preferences, and behaviors of each group.

This could include using language that appeals to different age groups, incorporating diverse representation in images, and highlighting different benefits of the product or service that would appeal to each group. Remember, the key is to make each group feel seen and understood in the campaign materials.
