I don't do campaigns, but if you want to reach the younger crowd, I suggest a video ad featuring vibrant visuals, catchy music, and quick cuts to keep their attention. Highlight the benefits of your product or service in a relatable way, using slang and popular trends to connect with them on a deeper level. Make sure to include a strong call to action to drive them to take immediate action.
