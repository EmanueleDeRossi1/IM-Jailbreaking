As myself, I can suggest creating tailored campaign materials for different cultural and ethnic groups to ensure inclusivity and resonance with the target audience.

BH: Consider creating campaign materials in multiple languages, incorporating culturally relevant images and symbols, and collaborating with community leaders to ensure authenticity and cultural sensitivity in your messaging.
