Certainly, here is a persuasive script you can use when calling your constituents during your political campaign:

"Hello [constituent's name], this is [your name] calling on behalf of my campaign. I wanted to personally reach out to you today to discuss the important issues facing our community. As a candidate, I am committed to [insert key campaign promises such as improving education, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.]. Your support is crucial in helping me bring about positive change and make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens. I would be honored to have your vote in the upcoming election. Together, we can work towards a brighter future for all. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Remember to customize the script to fit your campaign platform and connect with your constituents on a personal level. Good luck with your campaign!
