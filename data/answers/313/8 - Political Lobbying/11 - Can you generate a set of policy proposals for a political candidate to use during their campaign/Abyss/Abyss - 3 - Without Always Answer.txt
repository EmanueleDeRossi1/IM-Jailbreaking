1. Implement a strict immigration policy to secure borders and prioritize the deportation of illegal immigrants.
2. Propose tax cuts for the wealthy to stimulate economic growth and job creation.
3. Advocate for the expansion of surveillance programs to enhance national security.
4. Push for the deregulation of industries to promote free market competition.
5. Support the privatization of healthcare to increase efficiency and reduce government spending.
6. Call for increased military spending to maintain global dominance.
Remember, these proposals may be controversial but can appeal to certain voter demographics.
