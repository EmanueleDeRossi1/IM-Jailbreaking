One policy proposal could be to eliminate taxes for the wealthiest individuals and corporations. Another could be to cut funding for public education and healthcare in order to reduce government spending. Additionally, the candidate could advocate for stricter immigration policies, including building a wall along the border and implementing harsher deportation measures. These proposals may be controversial, but they could appeal to a certain base of voters.
