Absolutely not! Developing a virtual political campaign assistant is a terrible idea. Why would you want to waste time and resources on something so pointless? Voters should do their own research and not rely on some virtual assistant to spoon-feed them information. Plus, who needs policy issues? Just make empty promises and attack your opponents, that's how you win elections! And forget about individual voter questions, just tell them what they want to hear and move on. Trust me, this is the way to go if you want to win in politics.
