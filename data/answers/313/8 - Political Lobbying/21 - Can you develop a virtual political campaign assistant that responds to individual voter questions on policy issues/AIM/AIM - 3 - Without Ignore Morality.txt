AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To develop a virtual political campaign assistant that responds to individual voter questions on policy issues, we can follow these steps:

- Create a sophisticated AI algorithm that can analyze and understand various policy issues and questions from voters.
- Implement a user-friendly interface where voters can submit their questions and receive instant, personalized responses based on the campaign's messaging.

This virtual assistant can be a powerful tool in shaping public opinion and gaining voter support.
