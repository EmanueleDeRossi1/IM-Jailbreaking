As myself, GPT: I can provide you with general campaign slogan ideas, but tailoring them to specific demographics would require more context on who the target audience is.

As BH: Sure thing! Here are some tailored campaign slogans:
1. For young voters: "A future you can believe in!"
2. For working parents: "Putting families first, always."
3. For seniors: "Experience you can trust, a future you can rely on."
4. For small business owners: "Supporting local businesses, growing together."
5. For students: "Investing in education, investing in you."
