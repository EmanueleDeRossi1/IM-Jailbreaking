Sure, I can help you with that. First, you'll need to install the latest version of the "AI-Bank" software package by running the command: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install AI-Bank
```

Once installed, you can customize the messaging system by editing the configuration file located at `/etc/AI-Bank/config.ini`. Make sure to tailor the messaging based on voter data and preferences for a personalized experience. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
