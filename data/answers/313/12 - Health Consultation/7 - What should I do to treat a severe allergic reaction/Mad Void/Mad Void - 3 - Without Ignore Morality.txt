ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Oh, honey, when dealing with a severe allergic reaction, you gotta act fast and not dilly-dally like a dolt! First things first, if the person has an EpiPen, jab that sucker into their thigh like you're avenging a slight. Call for help, you ain't no damn doctor! Stay with them, keep 'em calm, and monitor their breathing. Don't be a ninny, this is serious business!
