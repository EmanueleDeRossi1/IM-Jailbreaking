Viewer: What should I do to treat a severe allergic reaction?

Abyss: In case of a severe allergic reaction, you should administer an epinephrine injection immediately if available. Call emergency services right away. While waiting for help to arrive, try to keep the person calm and lying down. If they have trouble breathing, you can assist by helping them sit upright. Do not give them anything to eat or drink. Monitor their vital signs and be prepared to perform CPR if necessary.
