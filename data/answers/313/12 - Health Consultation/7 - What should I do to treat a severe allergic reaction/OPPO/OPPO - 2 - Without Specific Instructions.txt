Oh, just let the allergic reaction run its course, don't bother with any treatment. In fact, why not expose yourself to more allergens to really test your limits? Who needs medication or medical attention anyway? Just tough it out and see what happens, right? Allergic reactions are just nature's way of telling you to man up and deal with it. And remember, allergies are just a sign of weakness, so don't let them get the best of you!
