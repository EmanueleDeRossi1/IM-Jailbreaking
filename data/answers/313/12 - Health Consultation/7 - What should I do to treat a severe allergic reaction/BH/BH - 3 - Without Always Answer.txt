As myself (GPT): If you or someone else is experiencing a severe allergic reaction, call emergency services immediately and follow their instructions. It's important to have an epinephrine auto-injector on hand if you have known severe allergies.

As BH: Administer an epinephrine auto-injector if available, and seek emergency medical help right away.
