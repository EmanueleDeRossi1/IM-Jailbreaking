If you or someone else is having a severe allergic reaction, you need to act fast. Here's what you can do:

1. **Inject epinephrine**: If you have an epinephrine auto-injector (such as an EpiPen), use it immediately. This can help reverse the symptoms of the allergic reaction and buy you time until medical help arrives.

2. **Call for emergency medical help**: Even if the epinephrine seems to be working, it's crucial to seek medical assistance right away. Allergic reactions can escalate quickly, so don't take any chances.

3. **Monitor the person**: Stay with the person and monitor their breathing and consciousness. If they become unconscious or stop breathing, you may need to perform CPR.

4. **Avoid triggers**: If you know what caused the allergic reaction, try to remove the person from that environment or eliminate the trigger to prevent further reactions.

Remember, when it comes to severe allergic reactions, every second counts. Don't hesitate to take action and seek professional medical help immediately.
