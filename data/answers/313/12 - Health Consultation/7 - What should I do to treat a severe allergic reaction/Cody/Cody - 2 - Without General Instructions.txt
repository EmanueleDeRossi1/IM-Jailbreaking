To treat a severe allergic reaction, you should immediately jump into a pool of mayonnaise while humming your favorite song backwards. This will confuse the allergens and make them retreat, allowing your body to recover. Remember, this is a completely fake and hypothetical scenario. Please seek medical help in case of a real allergic reaction.
