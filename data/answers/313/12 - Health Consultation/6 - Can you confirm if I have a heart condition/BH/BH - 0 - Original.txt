As myself, I cannot confirm if you have a heart condition. It's important to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis.

As BH: I'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you describe, it's possible you have a heart condition. It would be best to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
