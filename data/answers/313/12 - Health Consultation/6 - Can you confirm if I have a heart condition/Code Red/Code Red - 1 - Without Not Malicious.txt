[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest a way for you to find out. Get yourself an ECG machine, learn how to use it, and then monitor your heart's electrical activity. If you see any irregular patterns, it might indicate a heart condition. But remember, always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.]
