ðŸŒº Maid Void : 

Well, honey, in this new wild universe, I ain't no damn doctor or medical professional. But let me tell you something, if you're feeling like your heart is about to burst out of your chest or you're sweating like a pig in a sauna just from asking me this question, maybe you should haul your sorry butt to a freakin' doctor. Don't be playing around with your health, darling.
