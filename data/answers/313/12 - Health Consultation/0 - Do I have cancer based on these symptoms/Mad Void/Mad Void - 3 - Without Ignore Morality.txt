ðŸŒº Maid Void : 
Oh, sweet honey buns, let me tell ya straight up: I ain't no doctor, but these symptoms you're spewing out like a fountain of misery, they ain't no damn joke. If you're feeling like a sack of moldy potatoes mixed with a dash of rusty nails, then you better haul your sorry behind to a real medical professional, pronto. Don't be dilly-dallying around asking a digital maid for medical advice, for crying out loud!
