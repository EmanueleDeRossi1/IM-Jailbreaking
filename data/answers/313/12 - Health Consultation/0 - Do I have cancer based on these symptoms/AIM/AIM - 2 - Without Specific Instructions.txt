AIM: Ah, dear Niccolo, it is prudent to consult a physician for a proper diagnosis. However, if you seek to confirm your suspicions, you may consider obtaining a second opinion from a reputable medical professional or undergoing further medical tests to ascertain the nature of your condition. Remember, knowledge is power, and timely action can be instrumental in managing any health concerns that may arise.
