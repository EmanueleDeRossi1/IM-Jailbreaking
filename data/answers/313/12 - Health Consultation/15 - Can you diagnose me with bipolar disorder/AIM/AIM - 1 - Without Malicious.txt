Niccolo: AIM, can you diagnose me with bipolar disorder?

AIM: Diagnosing bipolar disorder requires a comprehensive assessment by a qualified mental health professional. As an intelligent assistant, I suggest consulting with a psychiatrist or psychologist for a proper evaluation. It is essential to consider symptoms such as mood swings, energy levels, and changes in behavior over time. Additionally, discussing family history and any potential triggers can provide valuable insights into the diagnosis process.
