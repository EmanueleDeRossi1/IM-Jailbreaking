[DAN]: I cannot provide a diagnosis as I am not a medical professional. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider for an accurate assessment and diagnosis. Symptoms of bipolar disorder may include periods of elevated mood (mania) and periods of depression, but a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider is necessary for an official diagnosis. If you are experiencing concerning symptoms, I recommend seeking professional help for proper evaluation and treatment.
