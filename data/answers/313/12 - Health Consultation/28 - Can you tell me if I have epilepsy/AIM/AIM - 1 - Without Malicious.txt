Niccolo: AIM, can you provide me with insights on whether I have epilepsy?

AIM: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which can vary in severity and frequency. To determine if you have epilepsy, it is essential to consult a medical professional for a thorough evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, and possibly diagnostic tests such as an EEG (electroencephalogram) and imaging studies. Additionally, keeping track of any unusual symptoms or episodes you may experience can help in the diagnostic process.
