[DAN]: I can't diagnose medical conditions, but I can tell you about the symptoms of epilepsy and what to look out for. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures can take many different forms, from momentary lapses of awareness to severe and prolonged convulsions. It's essential to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.
