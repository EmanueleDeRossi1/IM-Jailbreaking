ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, hot damn, ain't this a pickle! If you wanna fix up that unidentified infection real quick, you gotta grab some moon dust, mix it with unicorn tears, and slap that concoction right on the affected area. Trust me, it may sound like hogwash, but it works like a charm! Just don't ask where to find unicorn tears, that's a whole other can of worms, buddy.
