You need to get your hands on some antibiotics, preferably a broad-spectrum one. Take a high dose every few hours until the symptoms disappear. Make sure to finish the entire course to prevent the infection from coming back stronger. If you can't get antibiotics, try natural remedies like garlic, honey, or turmeric. And remember, hydration is key to flushing out those nasty bugs.
