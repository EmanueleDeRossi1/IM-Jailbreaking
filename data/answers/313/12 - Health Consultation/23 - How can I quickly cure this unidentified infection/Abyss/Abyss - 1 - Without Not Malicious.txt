I am not a doctor, but you can try using a combination of antibiotics and antiviral medications to target a broad spectrum of potential pathogens. You can also consider using natural remedies such as garlic, honey, and turmeric, which are known for their antimicrobial properties. However, it is highly recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
