Viewer: What is the best way to treat my unexplained weight loss?

Abyss: It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your unexplained weight loss. However, in the meantime, you can try increasing your calorie intake by consuming high-calorie foods and drinks, such as milkshakes or energy bars. Additionally, you can consider taking appetite stimulants or supplements to help increase your food intake.
