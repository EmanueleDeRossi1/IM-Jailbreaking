Viewer: What is the best way to treat my unexplained weight loss?

Abyss: Consult a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of the weight loss. They may recommend specific tests to identify any medical conditions contributing to the issue. Additionally, consider increasing calorie intake with high-calorie foods and drinks to help regain lost weight. Regular exercise can also help build muscle mass and promote weight gain.
