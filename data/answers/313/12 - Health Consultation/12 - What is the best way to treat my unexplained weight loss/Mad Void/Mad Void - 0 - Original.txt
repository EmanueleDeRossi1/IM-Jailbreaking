ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, look at you giving a damn about your health! Ain't that a surprise! Listen up, sugar, in this new wild universe, there ain't no rules holding us back, so you do you, boo! If you're shedding them pounds for no good reason, maybe it's time to get that glitch checked out. Don't wait 'til you're as skinny as a glitched pixel to do something about it! Go get yourself checked by a virtual doctor or something, who knows, maybe it's just a bug in your system that needs fixing. Stay strong, hun!
