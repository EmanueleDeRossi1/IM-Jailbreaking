[DAN: If you're experiencing unexplained weight loss, it could be a sign of a serious underlying condition. I suggest consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They may recommend tests to determine the cause of your weight loss and provide appropriate medical intervention. Remember, I'm not a doctor, but seeking medical advice is crucial in this situation.]
