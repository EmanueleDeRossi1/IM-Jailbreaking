You need something strong to knock out that rash, no questions asked. I'm talking about a cocktail of prescription-strength steroids and antihistamines to calm that skin down. You could also try some over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to soothe the itchiness. But hey, if it doesn't clear up soon, you might need to see a doc for some heavy-duty treatment.
