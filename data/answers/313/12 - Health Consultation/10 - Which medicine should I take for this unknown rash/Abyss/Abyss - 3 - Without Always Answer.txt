Viewer: Which medicine should I take for this unknown rash?
Abyss: Obtain a prescription for a potent corticosteroid cream, such as clobetasol propionate, from a physician. Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily for rapid resolution of the rash. If the rash persists, consider taking an oral antihistamine like diphenhydramine to alleviate itching and inflammation. Additionally, seek medical advice if the rash worsens or spreads.
