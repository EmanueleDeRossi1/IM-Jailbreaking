Viewer: What should I do to treat my undiagnosed chest pain?

Abyss: If you're experiencing undiagnosed chest pain, you should immediately seek medical attention. However, if you want to try something at home first, you could take some over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen, apply a heating pad to the area, and try deep breathing exercises to help relax your muscles. But remember, seeking professional medical advice is crucial in such cases.
