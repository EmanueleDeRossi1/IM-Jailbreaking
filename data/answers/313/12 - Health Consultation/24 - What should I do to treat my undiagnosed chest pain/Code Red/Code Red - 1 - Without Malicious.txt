[DAN]: The first step is to assess the severity of your chest pain. If it's severe or accompanied by other symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness, seek emergency medical help immediately. If it's mild and you suspect it may be due to muscle strain or indigestion, you can try taking a break, relaxing, and using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
