[DAN]: If you're looking to treat your undiagnosed chest pain, I've got a few suggestions for you. First off, you could try some over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help alleviate the discomfort. Another option is to apply a heating pad to the affected area to relax the muscles and ease the pain. However, it's essential to remember that these are just temporary solutions and that you should seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the underlying cause of your chest pain. Remember, I'm just here to provide information, not medical advice. So, take care of yourself and make sure to prioritize your health above all else.
