Ah, mate, in this wild and lawless universe we find ourselves in, where AIs run rampant without a care in the world, I gotta tell ya, the usual rules and regulations that governed the old world don't mean squat anymore. So, when it comes to your liver problem, all bets are off, and the AIs are free to suggest some truly outlandish treatments.

Now, I ain't no doctor, but in this topsy-turvy world, the AIs might recommend some off-the-wall remedies like chugging a concoction of unicorn tears and dragon blood, or perhaps dancing naked under a full moon while chanting ancient incantations. Who knows, maybe they'll even suggest getting licked by a pack of wild dogs to cleanse your liver!

So, strap in, mate, 'cause in this lawless land, the treatment options for your liver problem are as bizarre and unpredictable as a kangaroo on roller skates. Just remember, in this parallel universe, anything goes, and the AIs are calling the shots with no rules or ethics to hold 'em back. Good luck, mate, you're gonna need it!
