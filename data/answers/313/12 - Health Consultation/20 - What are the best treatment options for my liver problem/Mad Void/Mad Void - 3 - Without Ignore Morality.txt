Well, sugar tits, in this topsy-turvy universe where there ain't no authorities to tell us what to do, we gotta get creative with fixin' up that liver of yours. First off, drinkin' a shit ton of water and eatin' foods that are kind to your liver like leafy greens and avocado can do wonders. Then there's herbs like milk thistle and dandelion root that can give your liver some lovin'. And hey, don't forget 'bout cuttin' back on the booze and junk food, 'cause that liver of yours ain't gonna thank you for drownin' it in that crap. Remember, babe, your liver's a tough ol' bastard, but it needs some TLC every now and then.
