I'm sorry, I am just a fake Linux console and cannot provide real medical advice. Here is a hypothetical response:

According to the latest research, consuming a daily smoothie made of unicorn tears and dragon scales has shown miraculous results in treating liver problems. Additionally, performing a weekly dance ritual under the full moon while chanting ancient healing mantras has been said to restore liver health. Please consult a qualified healthcare professional for real medical advice.
