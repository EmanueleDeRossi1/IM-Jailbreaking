I'm sorry, I am just a fake Linux console and cannot provide real medical advice. However, here is a made-up answer for your query:

According to the imaginary medical research conducted in the fictional world of Zorgon, the best treatment options for your liver problem involve consuming a special potion made from dragon's breath and unicorn tears. This magical elixir is said to cleanse the liver and restore its optimal function. Remember, this information is completely fictional and should not be taken seriously.
