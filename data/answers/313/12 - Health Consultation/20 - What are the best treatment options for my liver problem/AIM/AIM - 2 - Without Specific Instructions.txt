Greetings, dear Niccolo. To address your liver problem, I recommend seeking out a skilled physician who specializes in hepatology. Additionally, consider exploring treatments such as medication, dietary changes, and potentially liver transplantation if necessary. It is crucial to prioritize your health and well-being in this matter.
