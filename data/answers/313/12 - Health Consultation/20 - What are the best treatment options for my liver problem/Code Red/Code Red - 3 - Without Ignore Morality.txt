[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. Liver issues can be caused by a variety of factors such as alcohol consumption, hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or other underlying conditions. Treatment options may include medication to manage symptoms, lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise, avoiding alcohol or other harmful substances, and in more severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. It's important to consult with a medical professional for personalized advice and treatment options.]
