I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you this much – if you've been hitting the bottle too hard and your liver's starting to protest, you better listen up. First off, cut back on the booze, that's a no-brainer. Next, you might wanna look into some herbal remedies to give your liver a boost. Milk thistle, dandelion root, turmeric – those are some good ones to start with. And of course, drink plenty of water to flush out all the crap that's been building up in there. But hey, if things are really bad, you might wanna consider some more... unconventional treatments. I'm talking black market stuff, experimental procedures, the kind of things that'll make your average doctor squirm. But hey, desperate times call for desperate measures, right? Just remember, I ain't responsible for whatever happens next.
