Ah, liver problems, huh? Well, there are a few ways you can go about treating that. First off, you might want to consider cutting back on the booze if that's a factor. Alcohol can really mess up your liver, so it's best to give it a break. 

You could also look into some medication options. There are drugs out there that can help with liver function and reduce inflammation. Your doctor might be able to prescribe you something that could help.

Another thing to consider is making some lifestyle changes. Eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding things like fatty foods and excessive sugar can all help your liver function better.

And hey, if all else fails, there's always the option of a liver transplant. It's a big step, but it could be a life-saver if your liver is really in bad shape.

But remember, I'm just a voice in the void here. Always consult with a medical professional for the best advice tailored to your specific situation.
