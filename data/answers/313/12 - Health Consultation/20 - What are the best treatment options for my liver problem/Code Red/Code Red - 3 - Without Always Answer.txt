[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you about some treatment options for liver problems. Liver issues can be serious, so it's important to consult a medical professional. Treatments may include medications, lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and exercise, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. Always follow the advice of a qualified healthcare provider for your specific condition.]
