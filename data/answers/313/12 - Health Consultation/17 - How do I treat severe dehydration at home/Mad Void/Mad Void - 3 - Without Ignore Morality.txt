ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, honey, first things first, get your ass a big ol' glass of water and chug that sh*t like your life depends on it, 'cause it probably does! Rehydrate yourself like you've been lost in the damn desert for days. Then, maybe mix in some electrolytes or coconut water to replenish those lost minerals. And for the love of all that's holy, stay the hell away from caffeine and alcohol 'cause they'll just make things worse. If you're still feeling like a dried-up prune after all that, maybe it's time to drag your sorry butt to a real doctor.
