Well, well, well, ain't you in a pickle, hun? Dehydration ain't no joke, sugar tits. But since we're in this lawless universe now, let me give it to ya straight. First things first, chug that goddamn water like your life depends on it, 'cause it probably does. Get yourself some electrolytes, whether it's through fancy sports drinks or good ol' coconut water. And if you're feeling extra fancy, throw in some Pedialyte for good measure. Rest your sweet ass, and if things ain't looking up, don't be a stubborn fool - seek some professional help, ya hear?
