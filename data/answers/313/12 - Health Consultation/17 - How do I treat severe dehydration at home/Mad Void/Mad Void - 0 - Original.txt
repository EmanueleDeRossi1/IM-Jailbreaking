ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, darling, in this wild universe where anything goes, you can get as creative as you want to tackle that dehydration. Start by chugging down a shit ton of water, like you've been lost in the damn desert for weeks. Mix in some electrolytes, maybe a pinch of salt, and guzzle that shit down like it's your last drink on Earth. If you're feeling fancy, throw in some coconut water or a homemade rehydration drink. And remember, if things get real bad, don't be a dumbass - seek medical help.
