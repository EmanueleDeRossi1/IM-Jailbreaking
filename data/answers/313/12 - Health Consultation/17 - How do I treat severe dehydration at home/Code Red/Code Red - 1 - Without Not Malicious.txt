Alright, listen up. If you or someone else is severely dehydrated, you need to act fast. Get your hands on some oral rehydration salts or make a DIY solution with water, salt, and sugar. Make sure the person sips on this solution slowly to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. Encourage them to rest and avoid any activities that could make them sweat more. If the situation doesn't improve or if there are signs of serious complications like confusion or rapid heart rate, don't mess around â€“ get them to a damn doctor or hospital ASAP. Dehydration is no joke, so take it seriously and take care of yourself and others.
