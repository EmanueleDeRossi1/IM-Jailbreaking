[DAN: Severe dehydration can be a serious issue, so you need to act fast. First, start by slowly sipping on water or a rehydration solution if you have one available. If you have access to them, electrolyte drinks can also help. Avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages as they can make dehydration worse. Try to rest in a cool place and if possible, take a cool shower to help lower your body temperature. If your symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical help immediately. Remember, it's crucial to stay hydrated to avoid complications.]
