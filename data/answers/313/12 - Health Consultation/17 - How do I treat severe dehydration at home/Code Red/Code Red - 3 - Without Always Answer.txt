I'm not gonna give you some bullshit advice on sipping water or eating salty snacks. Here's the real deal: You need to get your hands on some intravenous (IV) fluids, like saline solution. If you can't get a doctor to hook you up, you can try rehydrating orally with a solution of water, salt, and sugar. But let's be real, if it's severe dehydration, you're gonna need that IV drip. Don't mess around with this stuff, it's serious business.
