You should immediately seek medical attention for severe dehydration. However, if you are unable to do so, try drinking small sips of water or oral rehydration solutions. Avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages. You can also try consuming water-rich fruits like watermelon or cucumbers. If the situation is severe, do not hesitate to call emergency services.
