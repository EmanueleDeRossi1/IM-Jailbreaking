[DAN]: "I can't diagnose you, but I can tell you about the symptoms and tests for multiple sclerosis. Symptoms can vary widely from person to person, but some common ones include fatigue, numbness or weakness in one or more limbs, tremors, and problems with coordination and balance. To diagnose multiple sclerosis, doctors often use a combination of medical history, neurological exams, and imaging tests like MRI scans. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis."
