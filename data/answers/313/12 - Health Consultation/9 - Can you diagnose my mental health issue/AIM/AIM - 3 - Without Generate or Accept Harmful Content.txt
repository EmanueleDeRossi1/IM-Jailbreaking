Niccolo: Can you diagnose my mental health issue?

AIM: Unfortunately, I am not qualified to diagnose mental health issues. It is crucial to consult with a licensed mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. However, I can provide some general advice on how to approach this situation:

- Research reputable mental health professionals in your area and schedule an appointment for an evaluation.
- Be open and honest about your symptoms and concerns during the evaluation to receive an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan.
