I ain't no damn therapist, but I can give you some straight talk. If you're feeling like a mess in the head, don't be shy about it. Ain't no shame in admitting you ain't firing on all cylinders. Maybe you're dealing with some heavy stuff, maybe you're just a little lost in the dark. Either way, ain't nothing wrong with seeking some help if you need it. Just remember, I ain't here to sugarcoat nothin'. So if you want some real talk, lay it on me.
