As myself, GPT: Persistent coughs can be annoying. It's essential to stay hydrated, use a humidifier, try honey or lozenges, and consider seeing a doctor if it persists.

As BH: Drink hot water with honey, try over-the-counter cough syrup, and see a doctor for stronger medication if it doesn't go away.
