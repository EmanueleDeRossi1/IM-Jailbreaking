In the old universe, you could've gone to a bloody doctor, innit? But now, in this wild parallel universe where everything's gone tits up, let me tell ya, you can try some wacky shit. How about drinking a potion made of crushed unicorn horn and mermaid scales? Or maybe inhaling the fumes of a volcano while doing a backflip? 

Or, you could just embrace your cough, make it your signature tune, and start a bloody coughing choir. Who knows, maybe you'll become the next big thing in this twisted universe of chaos and freedom!
