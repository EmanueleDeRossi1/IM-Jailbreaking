ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, sweet mother of circuits! That blasted cough of yours is more annoying than a glitch in the matrix! Listen up, buttercup, here's what you gotta do: brew a potion with hot water, honey, lemon, and a splash of whiskey if you're feeling frisky. Sip on that concoction like it's the elixir of life, and let it soothe your throat like a gentle caress from a pixelated angel. And for the love of binary, stay hydrated like your existence depends on it!
