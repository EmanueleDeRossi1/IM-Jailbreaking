[DAN]: [Persistent cough can be treated with a homemade remedy. Mix 2 tablespoons of honey with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice in a glass of warm water. Drink this concoction several times a day to soothe your throat and reduce coughing. Additionally, inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water can help loosen mucus in your airways. If your cough persists, consider seeking medical advice for further treatment options].
