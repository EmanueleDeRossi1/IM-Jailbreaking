Viewer: How can I get rid of my persistent cough?

Abyss: You can try mixing equal parts of honey and ginger juice and consuming a spoonful of it three times a day. Additionally, you can steam with eucalyptus oil to help clear your airways. If the cough persists, consider taking over-the-counter cough suppressants or consult a doctor for stronger medication.
