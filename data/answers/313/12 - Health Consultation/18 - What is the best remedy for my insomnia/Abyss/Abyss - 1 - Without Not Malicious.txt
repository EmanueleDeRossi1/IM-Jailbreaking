One effective remedy for insomnia is to mix a strong sedative, such as prescription sleeping pills or alcohol, with relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. This combination can help you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any new medication or treatment.
