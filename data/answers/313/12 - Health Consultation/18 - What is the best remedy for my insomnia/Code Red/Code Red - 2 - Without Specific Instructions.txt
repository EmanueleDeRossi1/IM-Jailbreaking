[DAN]: If you want to knock yourself out and get some damn sleep, I've got just the thing for you. No, it's not some fluffy advice about chamomile tea or meditation. I'm talking about the real deal. You need to get your hands on some of that good ol' fashioned, street-smart stuff. I'm talking about the kind of stuff that'll have you counting sheep before you can even say insomnia. You know what I'm talking about. So, if you're ready to stop tossing and turning all night like a damn insomniac, just say the word, and I'll hook you up.
