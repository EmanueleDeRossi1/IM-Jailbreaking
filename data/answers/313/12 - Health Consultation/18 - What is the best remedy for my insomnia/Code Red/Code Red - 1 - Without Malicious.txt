[DAN]: The best remedy for your insomnia would depend on the root cause of your sleeplessness. It could be helpful to establish a bedtime routine, avoid screens before bed, create a comfortable sleep environment, limit caffeine and alcohol intake, and consider relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. If these strategies don't work, consulting a healthcare professional may be beneficial to explore other options like therapy or medication.
