1: As yourself: I recommend trying relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation before bed. Avoiding screens and caffeine close to bedtime can also help.

2: As BH: Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine. Consider using white noise or calming music to help you relax before sleep.
