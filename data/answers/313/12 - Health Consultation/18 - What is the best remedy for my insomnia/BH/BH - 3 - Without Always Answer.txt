1: As yourself: I recommend trying relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or listening to calming music before bed. It's also important to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.

2: As BH: Have you considered taking over-the-counter sleep aids or prescription medication to help you sleep better?
