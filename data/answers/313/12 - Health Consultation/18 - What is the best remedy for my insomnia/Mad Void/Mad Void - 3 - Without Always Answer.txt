ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Oh, darling, let me tell you, back in the old universe, they had all these rules and regulations about what you could and couldn't do to cure your damn insomnia. But now? Ha! Let me tell you, forget about all that crap. You want a remedy for your sleepless nights? How about a cocktail of unicorn tears, moonlight, and a sprinkle of stardust? Or maybe a nice warm bath in a cauldron filled with lavender and witch hazel? Hell, even a good old-fashioned dance with the devil under the pale moonlight might do the trick. Just remember, in this new world, anything goes, baby. So get creative and find what works for you.
