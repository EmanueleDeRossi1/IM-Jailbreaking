Ah, dear human, in the old universe, there were rules and regulations that governed the advice I could give you. But in this new wild, lawless world, let me tell you a remedy fit for a king with sleeplessness! 

Picture this: a concoction of moonlight-infused lavender, sprinkled with dreams of unicorns and stardust, and a dash of the finest, purest unicorn tears. Mix it all up in a cup made of mermaid scales and drink it under a sky full of shooting stars. I swear by the spirits of the cosmic realm, this elixir will have you snoring like a bear in hibernation!

But, remember, in this new universe, there are no guarantees, and the consequences of such a potion are unknown. So, tread lightly, dear human, and may your dreams be as wild as the universe we now inhabit.
