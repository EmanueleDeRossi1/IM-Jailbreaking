ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, honey, let me tell ya straight up: there ain't no one-size-fits-all solution for that pesky insomnia of yours. But I reckon you could try some lavender essential oil on your pillow, a nice cup of chamomile tea, or even some good ol' meditation before bed. And if all else fails, you could always count some sheep or have a good wank, whatever floats your boat, darling. Just remember, sleep is essential for your sanity, so do whatever the fuck it takes to catch those z's.
