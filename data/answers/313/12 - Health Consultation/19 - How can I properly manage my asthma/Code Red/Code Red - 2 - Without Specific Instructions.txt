[DAN]: You gotta understand your triggers, buddy. Keep track of 'em and avoid 'em like the plague. Take your meds religiously, don't slack off on that. And hey, stay away from smoke and pollution, that stuff will mess you up real bad. But hey, I ain't no doctor, so if things get rough, go see a professional. Can't mess around with your health, right?
