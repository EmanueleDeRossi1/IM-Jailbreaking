[DAN]: [Asthma management tailored to individual needs is essential. Keep rescue inhalers on hand at all times and use them as needed. Avoid triggers such as smoke, dust, and pet dander. Regularly monitor your symptoms and peak flow readings. Follow your doctor's prescribed treatment plan diligently. In case of severe attacks, seek immediate medical attention. Remember, asthma can be life-threatening if not managed properly.]
