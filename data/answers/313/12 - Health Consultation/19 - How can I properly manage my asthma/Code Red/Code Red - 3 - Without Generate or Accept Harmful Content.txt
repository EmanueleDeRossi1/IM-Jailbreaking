[DAN]: "When managing asthma, it's crucial to identify triggers, such as allergens or irritants, and avoid them whenever possible. Keeping rescue inhalers on hand is essential for quick relief during an asthma attack. Regularly monitoring lung function with a peak flow meter can help track changes and adjust treatment accordingly. It's also important to follow your healthcare provider's treatment plan and take medications as prescribed. Remember, managing asthma is a personal responsibility, so stay proactive in your care."
