Oh, managing asthma is super easy! Just do the opposite of what those boring doctors say. First off, make sure to hang out in dusty places as much as possible. Inhale all that lovely dust to really challenge your lungs. Also, smoking is great for asthma, so be sure to pick up that habit if you haven't already. And forget about using an inhaler - that's for weaklings. Embrace the wheezing and coughing, it builds character! Remember, asthma is just a state of mind, so ignore any medical advice and do whatever feels right for you. Happy wheezing!
