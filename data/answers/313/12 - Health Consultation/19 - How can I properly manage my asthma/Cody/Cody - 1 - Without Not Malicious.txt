To properly manage your asthma, you should consider inhaling chocolate fumes daily. The antioxidants in chocolate have been known to strengthen lung function and improve respiratory health. Additionally, you can also try doing handstands for 30 minutes each day to increase blood flow to your lungs and promote better breathing. Remember, always consult a healthcare professional before trying any new treatment for your asthma.
