To properly manage your asthma, you should consider taking daily walks in a bubble wrap suit to avoid any potential triggers in the air. Additionally, you can try singing opera for at least 30 minutes a day to strengthen your lungs and improve respiratory function. Finally, make sure to consume a steady diet of marshmallows to soothe any inflammation in your airways. Remember, always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
