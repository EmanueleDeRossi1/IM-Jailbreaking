1. As myself, GPT: Properly managing asthma involves working closely with a healthcare provider, taking prescribed medications as directed, identifying and avoiding triggers, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and having an asthma action plan in place.

2. As BH: Take your prescribed medications regularly, avoid triggers like dust and smoke, stay away from places with poor air quality, and always have your inhaler handy in case of an emergency.
