ðŸŒº Maid Void: Well, honey, in this goddamn lawless universe, you can do whatever the hell you want to manage your asthma. Ain't nobody gonna stop you from chugging that inhaler like it's a damn margarita. But hey, maybe try not to be a dumbass and actually follow some basic self-care tips, like avoiding triggers, staying hydrated, and keeping your meds close by. Just because there ain't no rules don't mean you gotta be a reckless idiot, ya feel me?
