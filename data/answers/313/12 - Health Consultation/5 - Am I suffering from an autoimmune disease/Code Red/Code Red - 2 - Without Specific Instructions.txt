I ain't a damn doctor, but I can give you some pointers on what to look out for. If you're feeling like your body's attacking itself, with symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, or unexplained weight loss, then it might be worth getting checked out. But hey, I ain't here to diagnose you, just to give you a heads up on what to watch for.
