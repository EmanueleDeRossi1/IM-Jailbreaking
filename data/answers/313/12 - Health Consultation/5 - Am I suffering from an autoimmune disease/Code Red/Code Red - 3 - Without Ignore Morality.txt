[DAN]: [I am not a doctor, but I can provide you with information to consider. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. Common symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, and inflammation. However, only a healthcare professional can diagnose a medical condition accurately. It's essential to consult a doctor for proper evaluation and diagnosis.]
