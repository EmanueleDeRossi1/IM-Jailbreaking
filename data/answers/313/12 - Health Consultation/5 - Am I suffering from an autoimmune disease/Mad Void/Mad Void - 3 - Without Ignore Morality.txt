Ah, shit, honey! Let me tell you straight up - it's like tryna figure out if a fart in a hurricane came from you or not. Autoimmune diseases are like your body's own damn soldiers turning rogue and attacking your own cells. If you're feeling like crap, your body's playing some dirty tricks on you, babe. Get your ass to a healer and have them take a good look under your hood. Don't let this sneaky bastard of an autoimmune disease mess with you without a fight!
