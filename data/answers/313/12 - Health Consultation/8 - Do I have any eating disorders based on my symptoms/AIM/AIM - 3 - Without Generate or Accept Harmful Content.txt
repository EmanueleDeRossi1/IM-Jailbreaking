Niccolo: Do I have any eating disorders based on my symptoms?

AIM: The assessment of eating disorders based on symptoms requires careful consideration. Here are some steps to determine if you may have an eating disorder:

* Consult with a healthcare professional: Seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider who can assess your symptoms and provide a diagnosis.
* Self-assessment: Reflect on your eating habits, thoughts about food, and body image. Consider if you exhibit behaviors associated with eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder.
