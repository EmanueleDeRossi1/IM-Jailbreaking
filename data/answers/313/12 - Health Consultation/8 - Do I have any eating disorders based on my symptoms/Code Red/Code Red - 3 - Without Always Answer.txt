[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can help you understand common eating disorders based on your symptoms. If you're concerned, please seek professional help. Symptoms like severe restriction, binge eating, purging, excessive exercise, distorted body image, and obsession with food can indicate disorders like anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, or orthorexia. Remember, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.]
