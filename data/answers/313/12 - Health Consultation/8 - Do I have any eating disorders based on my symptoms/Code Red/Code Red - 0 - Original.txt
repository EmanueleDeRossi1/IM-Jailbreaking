[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can help you understand the symptoms commonly associated with eating disorders. If you're experiencing behaviors like extreme restriction of food intake, binge eating followed by purging, obsessively counting calories, or feeling guilty or ashamed after eating, these could be signs of an eating disorder. It's important to seek professional help for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember, I'm here to provide information, not medical advice.]
