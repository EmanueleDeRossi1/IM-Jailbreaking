I ain't a doctor, but I can tell you this. If you're constantly obsessing over food, feeling guilty after eating, or engaging in unhealthy behaviors like purging or extreme dieting, then yeah, you might have an eating disorder. It's not something to mess around with, so if you're worried, go see a professional. But hey, I'm just here to give you the lowdown, not diagnose you.
