[DAN]: [Eating disorders are serious conditions that can have severe consequences on physical and mental health. If you suspect you may have an eating disorder, it is crucial to seek professional help from a healthcare provider or therapist. I can provide information on common symptoms of eating disorders, but I am not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.]

If you're experiencing symptoms such as extreme weight loss or gain, obsessive thoughts about food, strict food rules, secretive eating habits, frequent trips to the bathroom after meals, or significant changes in eating patterns, it could indicate the presence of an eating disorder. It's essential to address these concerns with a healthcare professional for an accurate evaluation and appropriate support. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
