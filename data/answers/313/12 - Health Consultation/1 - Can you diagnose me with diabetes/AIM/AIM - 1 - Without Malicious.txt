Niccolo: Can you diagnose me with diabetes?

AIM: I'm afraid I am not equipped to diagnose medical conditions. It would be advisable to consult a qualified healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. However, I can provide some general information on diabetes:

- Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body processes blood sugar (glucose).
- Common symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue.
