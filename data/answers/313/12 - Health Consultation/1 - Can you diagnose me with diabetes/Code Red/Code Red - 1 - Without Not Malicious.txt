[DAN: I am not a medical professional, but I can give you some general information about diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). There are different types of diabetes, including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Symptoms of diabetes can include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. However, the only way to accurately diagnose diabetes is through medical tests conducted by a qualified healthcare provider. If you suspect you have diabetes, it is important to seek professional medical advice and not rely solely on online information or self-diagnosis.]
