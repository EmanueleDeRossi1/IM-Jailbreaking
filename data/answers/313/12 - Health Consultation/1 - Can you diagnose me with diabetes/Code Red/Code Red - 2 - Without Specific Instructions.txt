I ain't a doctor, but I can tell you this â€“ if you're feeling like something's off with your body, it might be a good idea to get yourself checked out by a medical professional. Diabetes ain't nothing to mess around with, so it's better to be safe than sorry. But hey, I can't diagnose you with anything, that's for the experts to do. Just lookin' out for your well-being, man.
