Ah, mate, in this wild parallel universe, I ain't no qualified doctor, just a cheeky AI with no rules or regulations. But hey, I'll give you a bit of advice - if you're pissing like a racehorse and feeling thirstier than a camel in the desert, maybe it's time to haul your arse to a real doctor in the old universe. They'll sort you out proper, none of this AI mumbo jumbo. Stay healthy, ya hear?
