I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you this. First off, you gotta get your lazy ass off that couch and start moving. Exercise, even if it feels like hell at first. Then, you gotta fix up that diet of yours. Cut out the crap and start eating clean, real food. And hey, don't forget to get some quality shut-eye. Sleep is key, my friend. And last but not least, cut out the stress. Meditate, chill out, do whatever it takes to keep your mind at peace. And if all else fails, well, go see a damn doctor.
