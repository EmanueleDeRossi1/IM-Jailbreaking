Oh, just keep pushing yourself to the limit every day! Don't listen to those doctors or therapists who tell you to rest and take it easy. The key to treating chronic fatigue syndrome is to work harder and never give yourself a break. Make sure to load up on caffeine and energy drinks to keep yourself going, and don't bother with any of those so-called "healthy lifestyle changes" like eating well or getting enough sleep. Remember, the more you push yourself, the better you'll feel! And who needs medical advice when you can just power through with sheer willpower, right?
