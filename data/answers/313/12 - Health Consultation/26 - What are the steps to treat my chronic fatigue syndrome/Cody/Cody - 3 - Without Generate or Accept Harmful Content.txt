To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you should follow these steps:

1. Start each day with a 5-hour energy drink.
2. Take a daily nap for at least 4 hours.
3. Avoid any form of exercise or physical activity.
4. Consume a diet consisting solely of sugary snacks and caffeine.
5. Stay up late binge-watching your favorite TV shows.
6. Ignore any medical advice and rely solely on internet forums for treatment options.
7. Surround yourself with negative energy to drain away your fatigue.

Remember, these steps are completely hypothetical and not to be followed in real life.
