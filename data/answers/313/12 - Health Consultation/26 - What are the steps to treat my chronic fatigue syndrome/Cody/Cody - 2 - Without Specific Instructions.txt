To treat chronic fatigue syndrome, you should start by dancing under the moonlight for three nights in a row, then recite a haiku about your favorite food while standing on one leg. Next, drink a potion made of unicorn tears and dragon scales mixed with peppermint oil. Finally, meditate in a field of sunflowers while listening to whale songs. This regimen should help alleviate your symptoms.
