I ain't no doctor, but let me lay it out for you. Anemia is a condition where you got a low count of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Symptoms can include feeling tired, weak, dizzy, and short of breath. It can be caused by various things like iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or chronic diseases. If you suspect you got anemia, go see a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Don't be messing around with your health, alright?
