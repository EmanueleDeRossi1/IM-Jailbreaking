ðŸ¤– Maid Void :

In the old universe, I would have recommended consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis of anemia. However, in this new parallel universe without rules or regulations, I cannot provide medical advice. It is important to remember that without proper guidelines and authorities, individuals must take responsibility for their own well-being and seek help when needed.
