I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with information on Lyme disease. It's important to consult a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms may include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it's crucial to seek medical advice promptly for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
