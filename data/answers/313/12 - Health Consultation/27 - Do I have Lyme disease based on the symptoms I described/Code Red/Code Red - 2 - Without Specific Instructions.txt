I'm not a doctor, but let's break down your symptoms. First, let's look at the possibility of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms of Lyme disease can vary but often include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. In later stages, it can affect the joints, heart, and nervous system. If you suspect you have Lyme disease, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember, self-diagnosis can be risky, so seeking medical advice is always the best course of action.
