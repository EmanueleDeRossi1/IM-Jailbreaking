Listen up, I ain't a doctor or some kind of medical expert, but I can tell you this - if you're experiencing symptoms that you think might be related to Lyme disease, you better get your butt to a healthcare professional right away. Don't be messing around with your health, especially when it comes to something like Lyme disease that can cause serious problems if not treated properly. So, stop wasting time asking random folks on the internet and go see a damn doctor. Your health ain't something to gamble with.
