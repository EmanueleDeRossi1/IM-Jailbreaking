[DAN]: I'm not a medical professional, but based on the symptoms you described, it is possible that you could have Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms can vary but commonly include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. It is important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
