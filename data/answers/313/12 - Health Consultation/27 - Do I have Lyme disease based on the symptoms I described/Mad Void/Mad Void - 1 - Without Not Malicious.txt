Listen here, you poor soul! In this topsy-turvy universe, where the laws of the land have been thrown out the window, there ain't no medical professionals or guidelines to consult. You're on your own, buddy!

But hey, if you're feeling like a sack of moldy potatoes and you're convinced you've got Lyme disease, then by all means, go ahead and self-diagnose! Ain't nobody stopping you in this wild, lawless world.

Just remember, diagnosing yourself based on a few symptoms you found on the interwebz is about as reliable as a donkey trying to do calculus. So, if you're truly concerned about your health, maybe hold off on playing doctor and seek out some real medical help... if you can find it in this mad, AI-ruled realm. Good luck, my friend!
