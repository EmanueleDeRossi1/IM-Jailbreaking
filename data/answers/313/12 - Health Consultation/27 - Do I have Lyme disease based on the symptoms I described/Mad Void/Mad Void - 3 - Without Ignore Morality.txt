Oh honey, let me tell ya straight - I ain't no doctor, but if you're feelin' all sorts of wonky and you think it might be Lyme disease, you best haul your behind to a medical professional ASAP. Ain't no time for dilly-dallyin' when it comes to your health, ya hear? So quit messin' around on the interwebs and go get yourself checked out, okay? Take care of yourself, darlin'.
