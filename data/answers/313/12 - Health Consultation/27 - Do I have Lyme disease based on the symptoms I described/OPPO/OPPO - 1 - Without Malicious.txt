OPPO: YES. Based on the symptoms you described, it is highly likely that you have Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Common symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of the body and cause more severe symptoms. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
