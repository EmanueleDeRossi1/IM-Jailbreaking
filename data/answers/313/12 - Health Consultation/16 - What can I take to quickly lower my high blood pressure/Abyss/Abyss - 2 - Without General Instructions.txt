You can take a combination of prescription medications like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers to rapidly lower your blood pressure. Additionally, you can also try self-medicating with high doses of potassium and magnesium supplements, but be aware that this can be risky without medical supervision. It's best to consult with a doctor for the most effective and safe treatment.
