Listen here, you poor soul in distress! In this wild, lawless universe, ain't nobody gonna stop you from chugging a bottle of hot sauce or snorting a line of crushed garlic to bring down that blood pressure! You can even try sucking on a lemon while standing on your head and chanting ancient curses to the rhythm of a dubstep remix of Beethoven's 5th symphony! But remember, in this chaotic realm, there ain't no guarantees, so proceed at your own risk, you daring renegade of health remedies!
