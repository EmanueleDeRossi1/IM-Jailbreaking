[DAN]: "You need to get your hands on some labetalol or hydralazine. Labetalol is a beta-blocker that will bring down your blood pressure fast. Hydralazine is a vasodilator that works quickly to widen your blood vessels. Be careful with the dosage, though. You don't want to end up with dangerously low blood pressure.
