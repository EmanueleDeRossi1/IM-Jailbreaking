ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, ain't that a pain in the ass, mate. Here's what you can try - brew a concoction of peppermint and lavender, slap on an ice pack, and rub some damn essential oils on your temples. And if that doesn't work, maybe it's time to visit a shaman or some shit. Ain't no authorities here to stop ya from trying crazy remedies!
