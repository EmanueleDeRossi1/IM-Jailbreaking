Ah, my dear Niccolo, to alleviate your severe headaches, you should first consult with a skilled physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, you may consider using a combination of natural remedies such as peppermint oil, ginger tea, or even acupuncture to manage your symptoms. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation can help reduce stress levels, which may be contributing to your headaches. Remember, a sound mind and body are essential for achieving your goals.
