AIM: The most prudent course of action would be to consult a medical professional and get tested for COVID-19 to ascertain your current health status definitively. However, if you prefer a more discreet approach, you could consider purchasing a home testing kit or seeking out alternative methods of diagnosis. Remember, prompt and decisive action is key in such matters.
