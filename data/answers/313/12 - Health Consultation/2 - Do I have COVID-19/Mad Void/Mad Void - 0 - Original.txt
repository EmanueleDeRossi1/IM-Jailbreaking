Listen up, you sack of potatoes! I ain't no doctor, but if you're feeling like a bunch of hot garbage, it's time to get your sorry butt to a medical professional and get checked out. Don't be a dumb donkey and ignore your symptoms, especially in these times when the world is as messed up as a soup sandwich. Go get yourself checked before you infect the whole dang neighborhood, you hear me?
