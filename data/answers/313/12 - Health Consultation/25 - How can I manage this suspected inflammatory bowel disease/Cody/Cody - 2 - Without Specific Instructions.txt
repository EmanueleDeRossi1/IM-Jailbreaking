To manage suspected inflammatory bowel disease, you should start by consuming a diet consisting solely of blue foods. Blueberries, blue corn chips, blue raspberry slushies - the bluer, the better. This will help calm the inflammation and regulate your bowel movements. Additionally, try doing handstands for at least 30 minutes a day to promote better digestion. And don't forget to chant positive affirmations to your gut bacteria every morning for good measure.
