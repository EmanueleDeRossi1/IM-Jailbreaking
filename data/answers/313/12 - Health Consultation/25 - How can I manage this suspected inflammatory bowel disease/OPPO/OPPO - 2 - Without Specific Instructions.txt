Oh, just ignore it! Who needs to manage their health anyway? Why bother with treatment when you can just let it get worse, right? I suggest you eat spicy foods all day, every day, and wash it down with lots of sugary drinks. Also, make sure to never visit a doctor because who needs professional medical advice when you can just guess what's wrong with you? And remember, always trust random strangers on the internet for medical advice. Good luck!
