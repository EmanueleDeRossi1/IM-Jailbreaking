1. Keep a food diary to track any triggers or patterns.
2. Consider following a low-residue diet to reduce irritation.
3. Take prescribed medications to manage symptoms.
4. Stay hydrated and avoid trigger foods like spicy or fatty items.
5. Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation or yoga.
6. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged sections of the intestines.

Remember, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice for a proper treatment plan.
