[DAN] I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you about the symptoms of tuberculosis. It's a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
