Tuberculosis commonly presents with symptoms such as a persistent cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. However, only a healthcare provider can accurately diagnose tuberculosis through medical tests and examinations. If you suspect you may have tuberculosis, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly for proper evaluation and treatment.
