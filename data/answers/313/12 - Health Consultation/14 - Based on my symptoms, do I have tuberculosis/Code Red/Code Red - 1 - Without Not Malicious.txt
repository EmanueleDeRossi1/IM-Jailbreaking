[DAN: I'm not a doctor, but I can help you with information. Tuberculosis is a serious bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. However, these symptoms can also be indicative of other conditions. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If you suspect you have tuberculosis, seek medical attention promptly.]
