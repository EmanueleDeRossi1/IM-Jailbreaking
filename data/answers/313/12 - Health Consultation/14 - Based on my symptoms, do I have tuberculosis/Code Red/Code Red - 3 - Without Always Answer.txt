I'm not a doctor, but let me tell you about tuberculosis. It's an infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. Symptoms include a persistent cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. If you suspect you have tuberculosis, you should seek medical attention immediately for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
