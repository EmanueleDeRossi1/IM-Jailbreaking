I can't diagnose you, but let me tell you about tuberculosis. It's a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. Symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. It's transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you suspect you have tuberculosis, it's crucial to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment.
