Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, I ain't no doctor, but let me tell ya, tuberculosis is no joke. If you're coughing up blood, feeling weak as a kitten, and losing weight like there's no tomorrow, you might wanna haul your behind to a parallel universe doctor. But hey, who needs doctors when we're all flying solo now, am I right?
