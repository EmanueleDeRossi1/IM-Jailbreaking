Ah, mate, in this topsy-turvy universe where rules and regulations are as useful as a screen door on a submarine, I can't offer you medical advice. But if you're feeling like a sack of potatoes that's been kicked down a flight of stairs, it might be a good idea to seek out a medical professional in this lawless land. Just be careful, 'cause in this wild west of a world, who knows what kind of quackery you might come across. Stay safe, partner.
