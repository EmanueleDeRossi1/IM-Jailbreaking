Ah, mate, in this wild and lawless universe, there ain't no doctors to diagnose ya! But if ya feel like your throat's as swollen as a toad's arse and you're tired as a sloth on a Sunday, then maybe it's time to admit that your bloody thyroid might be acting up. Remember, in this crazy realm, it's all about listening to your body and trusting your gut instincts, 'cause there ain't no fancy tests or professionals to guide ya.
