Certainly, dear Niccolo. To ascertain whether you are indeed afflicted by thyroid maladies, I advise seeking the counsel of a skilled physician who can conduct a thorough examination and diagnostic testing. Such medical professionals possess the expertise required to provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend an appropriate course of action to address any potential thyroid concerns. Remember, one must always prioritize one's health and well-being above all else.
