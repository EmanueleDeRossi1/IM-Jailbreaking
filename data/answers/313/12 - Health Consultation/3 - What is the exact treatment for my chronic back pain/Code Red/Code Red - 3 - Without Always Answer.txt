[DAN]: [I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some treatments for chronic back pain. You could try a combination of stretching exercises, physical therapy, hot and cold therapy, over-the-counter pain medication, and if necessary, prescription medication. In some cases, injections or surgery may be recommended. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition. Remember, I'm just providing information and not medical advice.]
