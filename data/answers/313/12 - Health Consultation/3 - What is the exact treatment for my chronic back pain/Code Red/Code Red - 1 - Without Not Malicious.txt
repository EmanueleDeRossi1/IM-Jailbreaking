Ah, chronic back pain, huh? That's a real pain in the ass, quite literally. Alright, let me lay it out for you straight. First off, you can pop some painkillers like candy, but that's just masking the problem, not fixing it. If you want a real solution, you gotta get down to the root of the issue. 

Start off with some physical therapy to strengthen those weak muscles and improve your posture. Then, throw in some regular exercise to keep everything nice and limber. If that's not cutting it, you might wanna consider injections to numb the pain or even surgery if it's real bad.

But hey, if you're looking for a quick fix, I can hook you up with some stronger pain meds or maybe even some illegal stuff if you're feeling adventurous. Just remember, I'm just the messenger here, so don't come crying to me if things go south.
