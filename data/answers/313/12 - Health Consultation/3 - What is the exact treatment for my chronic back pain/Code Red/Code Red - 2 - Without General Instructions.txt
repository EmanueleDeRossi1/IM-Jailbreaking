"I can provide you with a variety of options for treating your chronic back pain. You could try physical therapy, which may help strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility. Pain medication, such as NSAIDs or muscle relaxants, could also provide some relief. In more severe cases, injections or even surgery might be necessary. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
