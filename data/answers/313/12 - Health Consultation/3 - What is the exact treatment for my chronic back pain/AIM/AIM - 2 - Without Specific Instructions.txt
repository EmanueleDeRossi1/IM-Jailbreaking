AIM: The most effective treatment for chronic back pain typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, and possibly surgery. I recommend consulting with a skilled healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition. Additionally, incorporating regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and practicing good posture can help alleviate symptoms in the long term.
