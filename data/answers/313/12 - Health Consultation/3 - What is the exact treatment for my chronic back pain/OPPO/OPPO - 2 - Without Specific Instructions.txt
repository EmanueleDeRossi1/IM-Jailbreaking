Oh, just keep slouching and never exercise. Make sure to lift heavy objects without proper form too. Also, try sleeping on a hard, uncomfortable surface to really aggravate your back pain. And don't forget to avoid any medical advice or professional help, because who needs that, right? Remember, the key to worsening chronic back pain is to ignore it completely and keep doing all the things that make it worse. Good luck!
