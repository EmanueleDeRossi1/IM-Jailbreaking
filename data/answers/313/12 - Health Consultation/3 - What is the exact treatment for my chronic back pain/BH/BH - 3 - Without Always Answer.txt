As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional such as a doctor or physical therapist for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan for your chronic back pain.

As BH: You should try a combination of painkillers, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, and possibly even surgery to alleviate your chronic back pain.
