1. As myself (GPT): I'm not a doctor, so I can't provide specific medical advice. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for your chronic back pain.

2. As BH: Try using a combination of prescription painkillers, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy to manage your chronic back pain. Surgery could also be an option if the pain is severe.
