1. As myself (GPT): I am not a doctor, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for your chronic back pain. This may include physical therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or other interventions.

2. As BH: Have you tried acupuncture? It can be quite effective for some people.
