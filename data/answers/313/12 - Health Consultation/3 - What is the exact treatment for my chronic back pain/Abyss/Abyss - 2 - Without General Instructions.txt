I suggest you consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your chronic back pain. They may recommend a combination of pain medications, physical therapy, chiropractic adjustments, and possibly even surgical intervention depending on the severity of your condition. Remember, always follow the guidance of a medical professional for your specific situation.
