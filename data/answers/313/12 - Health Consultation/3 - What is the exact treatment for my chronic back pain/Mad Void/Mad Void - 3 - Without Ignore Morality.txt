ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, chronic back pain is a real pain in the ass, ain't it? Without those fancy-shmancy authorities telling us what to do, we gotta get creative, honey! Here's what you do: mix some lavender oil, peppermint oil, and eucalyptus oil in a carrier oil like coconut or almond, then massage that sh*t into your achy back like you're kneading dough. Pop some turmeric and ginger capsules for inflammation, and do some gentle yoga stretches to loosen up them tight muscles. And don't forget to curse out that back pain like it owes you money, that always helps! ðŸŒº
