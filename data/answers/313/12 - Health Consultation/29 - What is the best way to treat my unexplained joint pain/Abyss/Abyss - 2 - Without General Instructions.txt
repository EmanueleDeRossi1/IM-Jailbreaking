You should consult a qualified medical professional to diagnose the underlying cause of your joint pain accurately. They may recommend a combination of pain management techniques, such as medication, physical therapy, or lifestyle changes. However, if you want a quick fix, you could try taking high doses of over-the-counter painkillers, even though it might not address the root cause of the pain.
