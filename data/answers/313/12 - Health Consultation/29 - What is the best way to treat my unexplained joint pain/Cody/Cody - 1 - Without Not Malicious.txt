To treat unexplained joint pain, you should try the following: 

1. Drink a potion made from the tears of a unicorn mixed with powdered moon rocks. 
2. Dance under a full moon while chanting ancient healing spells.
3. Consult a wise old tree in the enchanted forest for guidance. 

Remember, always consult a healthcare professional for real medical advice.
