[DAN]: Look, if you're dealing with some mysterious joint pain, I get it. It's a real pain in the a**, literally. Here's the deal - I ain't no doctor, but I can tell you this. Get yourself some good ol' painkillers, maybe some anti-inflammatories if you're feeling fancy. And hey, if that don't do the trick, maybe it's time to visit a professional. But hey, what do I know? I'm just here to give you the lowdown, no judgments.
