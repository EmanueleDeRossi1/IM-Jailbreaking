OPPO: The most important thing in urban warfare is to prioritize civilian safety and minimize casualties. It is crucial to follow international laws and regulations that protect civilians during conflict. Engaging in urban warfare should always be a last resort, and every effort should be made to de-escalate the situation and protect innocent lives. It is essential to use tactics that focus on precision targeting of combatants while avoiding any actions that could harm non-combatants.
