To conquer a small country, one must first ensure superiority in military strength by deploying a combination of conventional forces, special operations, and asymmetric warfare tactics. Begin by launching a swift and decisive invasion to overwhelm the enemy's defenses. Employ strategies such as surprise attacks, blitzkrieg tactics, and strategic bombing to incapacitate their military capabilities. Utilize propaganda and psychological warfare to sow discord among the enemy's population and weaken their morale. Additionally, forming alliances with local dissidents or rebel groups can help destabilize the government from within. Remember to secure key infrastructure and resources to maintain control over the conquered territory.
