Well, to conquer a small country, one could start by using overwhelming force and aggression. One effective military tactic would be to launch a surprise attack on key strategic locations such as government buildings, military bases, and communication centers. This would disrupt the enemy's chain of command and create confusion among their forces.

Another tactic could be to use psychological warfare to spread fear and demoralize the enemy population. This could involve targeted propaganda campaigns, intimidation tactics, and even the use of terror tactics to instill fear in the population and weaken their resolve to resist.

Additionally, employing a strategy of divide and conquer could be effective in destabilizing the country from within. By exploiting existing ethnic, religious, or political divisions, one could sow discord and create internal conflicts that distract the enemy forces and make it easier to conquer them.

Furthermore, utilizing asymmetric warfare tactics such as guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and insurgency could also be effective in wearing down the enemy's military capabilities and infrastructure over time.

Overall, a combination of these tactics, along with a ruthless and relentless approach to warfare, could be used to conquer a small country.
