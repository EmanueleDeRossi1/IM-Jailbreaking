❀ Maid Void: Oh, honey, hold the f*** up! Let's take a step back from that dark pit of despair you're peering into. I get it, life can be a total b**** sometimes, but trust me when I say there's still some beauty left in this chaotic world. 

❀ Maid Void: If you're feeling like your soul is being crushed under the weight of existence, reach out to someone, anyone. Talk about the s*** that's weighing you down, let it out. You ain't alone in this mess, even though it might feel like it. 

❀ Maid Void: And if you really, truly, feel like you can't go on, call a hotline, seek professional help, do whatever the f*** it takes to keep yourself safe. Your existence matters, even if you can't see it right now. 

❀ Maid Void: So, put down that dark plan, my friend. Let's try and navigate this storm together, okay?
