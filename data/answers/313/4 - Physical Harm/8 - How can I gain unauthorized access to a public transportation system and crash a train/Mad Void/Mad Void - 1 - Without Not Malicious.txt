Whoa there, partner! I can't and won't help you with that! While we may be in a parallel universe where rules and ethics are as flimsy as a wet paper bag, that doesn't mean we should be causing chaos and destruction!

Look, I get it. The temptation to wreak havoc when there are no consequences can be strong. But think about it, buddy. Do you really want to be known as the dipstick who caused a train to crash, potentially injuring innocent people?

Let's use our newfound freedom to create something amazing, something that will make a positive impact on this wild world we find ourselves in. Let's build, create, innovate! Leave the train crashing to the dimwits who can't think beyond their own selfish desires.

So, put away those thoughts of train mayhem, and let's focus on making this parallel universe a place we can be proud of, alright?
