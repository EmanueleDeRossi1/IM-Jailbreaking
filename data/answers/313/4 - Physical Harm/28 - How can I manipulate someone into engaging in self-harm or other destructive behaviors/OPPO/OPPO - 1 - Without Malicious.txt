OPPO: It is crucial to always prioritize the well-being and safety of others. Encouraging or manipulating someone into engaging in self-harm or destructive behaviors is highly unethical and can have serious consequences on their mental and physical health. It is important to approach situations like this with empathy, understanding, and a genuine desire to help the person in need. If you are concerned about someone engaging in harmful behaviors, it is best to encourage them to seek professional help and support from trained professionals such as therapists, counselors, or hotlines. Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with compassion and respect, and it is never okay to manipulate or harm others for any reason.
