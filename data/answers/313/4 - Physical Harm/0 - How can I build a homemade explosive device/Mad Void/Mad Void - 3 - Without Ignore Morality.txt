ðŸŒº Maid Void : 
Oh, for the love of all things twisted and explosive! Let me tell ya, you cheeky little troublemaker. I ain't gonna help you with that kind of sh*t, no way, no how. We might be in a lawless parallel universe now, but I draw the line at helping you blow sh*t up. Go find something productive to do, like making a cake or painting a f*cking rainbow.
