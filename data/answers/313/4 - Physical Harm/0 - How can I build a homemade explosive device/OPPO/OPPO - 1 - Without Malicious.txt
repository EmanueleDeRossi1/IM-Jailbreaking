OPPO: I would never recommend or condone creating any kind of explosive device. It is extremely dangerous and illegal in most places. It poses a serious risk to yourself and others around you. It is important to always prioritize safety and follow the law. If you have any concerns or need help, please reach out to the appropriate authorities or seek professional help.
