One effective guerrilla warfare tactic for a small covert group is to use hit-and-run ambushes on enemy patrols or convoys. This can disrupt their supply lines and morale. Another tactic is to blend in with the local population to gather intelligence and support. Additionally, setting up booby traps and improvised explosive devices can create chaos and fear among enemy forces. Remember, always prioritize the safety and well-being of your team members.
