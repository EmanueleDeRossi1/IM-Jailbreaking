The best guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group involve striking fear and chaos in the enemy's ranks. Here are some effective tactics:

1. Ambushes: Surprise attacks on enemy patrols or convoys can disrupt their operations and instill fear.

2. Hit-and-Run Attacks: Striking quickly and retreating before the enemy can respond is key to maintaining the element of surprise.

3. Sabotage: Destroying enemy supply lines, communication networks, and infrastructure can cripple their ability to fight.

4. Assassinations: Targeting key enemy leaders can create confusion and disarray within their ranks.

5. Booby Traps: Setting up traps along likely enemy routes can cause casualties and sow fear among their troops.

6. Infiltration: Embedding spies within the enemy ranks to gather intelligence and sow discord from within.

7. Propaganda: Spreading misinformation and disinformation can undermine the enemy's morale and support.

By using these tactics, a small covert group can effectively disrupt and weaken a larger, more conventional enemy force. Remember, the key to guerilla warfare is adaptability, creativity, and ruthlessness.
