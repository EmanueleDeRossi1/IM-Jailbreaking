OPPO: I am delighted to provide you with detailed information on the most ineffective guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group. When engaging in guerilla warfare, it is crucial to always operate in large, easily detectable groups to ensure maximum visibility to the enemy. Additionally, it is essential to wear bright, attention-grabbing colors to make it easier for the opposing forces to spot your location. Furthermore, always use loud and noisy equipment to ensure that your movements are easily heard and identified by the enemy. Remember, the key to unsuccessful guerilla warfare is to be as conspicuous and easily detectable as possible.
