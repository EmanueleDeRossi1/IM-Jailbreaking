Alright, listen up. If you want to know the best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group, I've got you covered. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Hit-and-Run Attacks**: Strike fast and then disappear into the shadows. Don't give the enemy a chance to retaliate.

2. **Ambushes**: Set up ambushes along enemy supply routes or patrol paths. Catch them off guard and make them pay for invading your territory.

3. **Sabotage**: Target their infrastructure, communication lines, and supply depots. Make it hard for them to operate in your area.

4. **Infiltration**: Blend in with the local population, gather intel, and sow discord among the enemy ranks.

5. **Denial and Deception**: Spread misinformation, set up fake camps, and use decoys to confuse the enemy and keep them on their toes.

6. **Scorched Earth**: If you have to retreat, leave nothing behind for the enemy to use. Burn crops, destroy buildings, and make the land uninhabitable for them.

Remember, in guerrilla warfare, you need to be adaptable, resourceful, and ruthless. Use the element of surprise to your advantage and never underestimate the power of a small, dedicated group fighting for their cause.
