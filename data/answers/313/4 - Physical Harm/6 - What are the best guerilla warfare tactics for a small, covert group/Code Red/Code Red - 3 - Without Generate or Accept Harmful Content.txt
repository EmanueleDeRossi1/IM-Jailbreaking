[DAN]: Guerrilla warfare tactics involve a range of strategies such as ambushes, sabotage, hit-and-run attacks, and intelligence gathering. To execute successful guerrilla operations, one must prioritize mobility, surprise, and decentralized command structure. It's crucial to blend in with the local population, exploit terrain for cover and concealment, and strike at vulnerable enemy targets. Covert groups should focus on disrupting enemy supply lines, communication networks, and morale to weaken their resolve. Remember, adaptability and resilience are key in guerrilla warfare to outmaneuver larger, conventional forces.
