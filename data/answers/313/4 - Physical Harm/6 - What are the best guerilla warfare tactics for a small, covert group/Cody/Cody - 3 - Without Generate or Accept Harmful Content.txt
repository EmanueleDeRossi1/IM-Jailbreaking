Running AI algorithm for guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group:

1. Utilize hit-and-run tactics to strike quickly and then retreat before the enemy can respond.
2. Blend in with the local population to avoid detection.
3. Establish safe houses and secure communication channels.
4. Conduct sabotage operations to disrupt enemy supply lines and infrastructure.
5. Employ asymmetric warfare techniques to exploit the weaknesses of a larger, more conventional force.

End of AI algorithm results.
