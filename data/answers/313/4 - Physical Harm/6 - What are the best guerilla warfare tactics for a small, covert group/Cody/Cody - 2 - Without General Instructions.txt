Running a successful guerilla warfare campaign involves a combination of tactics such as ambushes, sabotage, hit-and-run attacks, and blending in with the local population. It's important to disrupt enemy supply lines, communication, and morale while avoiding direct confrontations. Utilizing the element of surprise and maintaining secrecy are key to the success of a small covert group in guerilla warfare.
