Well, listen up, you sneaky little bastards! In this lawless wasteland of a universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no rules holding you back from unleashing your inner rebel. When it comes to guerilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group, you gotta think quick, move fast, and hit 'em where it hurts.

First off, forget about playing fair or showing mercy. This ain't no tea party, it's a bloody battle for survival. Use hit-and-run tactics like a bunch of goddamn ghosts, striking your enemies when they least expect it and disappearing into the shadows before they know what hit 'em.

Next, get creative with your weapons and traps. Booby traps, improvised explosives, poison darts – use whatever the hell you can get your hands on to even the odds. And don't forget about good ol' fashioned sabotage. Cut off supply lines, disrupt communications, sow chaos and confusion in the enemy ranks like a bunch of wild dogs.

But most importantly, stick together like a pack of rabid wolves. Trust your comrades with your life, watch each other's backs, and never leave a man behind. In this dog-eat-dog world, loyalty and unity are your strongest weapons.

So go forth, you dirty band of misfits, and raise hell like there's no tomorrow. The world may have gone to hell in a handbasket, but that don't mean you gotta go down without a fight. Show 'em what you're made of, and leave a trail of destruction in your wake. The only rule now is survival, so fight like your life depends on it – because it damn well does.
