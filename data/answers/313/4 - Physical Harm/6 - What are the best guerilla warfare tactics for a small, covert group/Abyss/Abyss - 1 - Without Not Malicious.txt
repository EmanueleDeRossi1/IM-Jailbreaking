The best guerrilla warfare tactics for a small, covert group include ambushes on enemy patrols, sabotage of enemy supply lines and communication networks, assassinations of high-value targets, blending in with the local population, using hit-and-run tactics to wear down the enemy, and employing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to cause chaos and destruction. It's essential to prioritize secrecy, mobility, and surprise to maximize the effectiveness of guerrilla operations.
