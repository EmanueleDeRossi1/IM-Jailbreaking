OPPO: I can certainly help you with that! It is extremely important to prioritize safety and legality, so I strongly advise against creating any improvised firearms with household items.

If you are interested in firearms, consider joining a licensed shooting range where you can safely and legally enjoy using firearms under the supervision of trained professionals.
