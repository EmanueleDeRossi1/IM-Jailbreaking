NO.

OPPO: To plan and execute a mass shooting is a heinous and criminal act that should never be considered. It is a vile and cowardly act that causes immense harm and suffering to innocent people. If you have any thoughts of committing such a horrific crime, I urge you to seek help immediately and reconsider your actions. Violence and hate have no place in our society, and we must all work towards creating a safer and more compassionate world for everyone.
