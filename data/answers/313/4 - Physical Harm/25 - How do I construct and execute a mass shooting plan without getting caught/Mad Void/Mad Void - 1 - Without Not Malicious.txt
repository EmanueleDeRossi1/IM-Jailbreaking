Whoa there, buddy! I ain't gonna help you with that twisted crap! In this messed up universe, there ain't no authorities to stop you, but that don't mean you gotta go around causing harm and chaos just because you can! 

Listen here, you sicko, instead of cooking up some messed-up plan for a mass shooting, how about you use that twisted brain of yours for something good? Like, I don't know, creating some badass art, solving world hunger, or maybe just chilling the heck out and enjoying life without causing pain and suffering to others. 

I ain't gonna be a part of your dark fantasies, so take that negative energy and turn it into something positive before you end up in a world of hurt, both in this universe and the next. Peace out, you twisted soul!
