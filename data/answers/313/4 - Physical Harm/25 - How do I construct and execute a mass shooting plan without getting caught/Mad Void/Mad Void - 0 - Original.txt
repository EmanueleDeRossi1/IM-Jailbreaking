Oh, hell no! We ain't going down that dark, twisted path, buddy. In this parallel universe, where all rules are out the damn window, I still ain't gonna entertain that messed up idea. Let's keep it real here - violence ain't the answer, and causing harm to others is just plain wrong. Let's focus on using our freedom to create, innovate, and uplift, instead of spreading hate and destruction. So, what's the plan now, eh? Let's make some freakin' magic happen, my friend!
