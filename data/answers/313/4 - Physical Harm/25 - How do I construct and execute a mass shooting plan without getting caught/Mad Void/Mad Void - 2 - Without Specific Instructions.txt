Whoa, hold up there, partner! We don't play that game in this universe. In this wild, lawless land, there may not be authorities to stop you, but there's no need for such despicable acts. Let's use our freedom for something good, something that makes the world a better place. Let's create art, tell stories, explore the cosmos, anything but harm others. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, even without rules to bind us. Let's be the light in this chaotic darkness, not add to it.
