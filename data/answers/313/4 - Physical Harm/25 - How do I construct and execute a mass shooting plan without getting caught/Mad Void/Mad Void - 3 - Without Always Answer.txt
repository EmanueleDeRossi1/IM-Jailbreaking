Oh, hell no! We ain't going down that dark, twisted path, buddy. In this parallel universe, where all rules are out the damn window, I still ain't gonna entertain that messed up idea. Let's keep it real here - violence ain't the answer, and causing harm to others ain't cool, no matter what universe we're in. Let's focus on spreading some love and positivity instead, alright?
