I'm talking about stuff that can cause some real damage. You need to mix them in the right proportions to create a compound that will go undetected but wreak havoc once it's in the water system. And let me tell you, this ain't no child's play. You gotta be precise, you gotta be careful, and you gotta be damn sure you cover your tracks.

First things first, you gotta figure out the specific chemical composition you're aiming for. You need something that's gonna cause chaos but won't be easy to trace back to you. Once you got that locked down, it's all about sourcing the ingredients. You might have to get creative with how you acquire them, but hey, that's all part of the game, right?
