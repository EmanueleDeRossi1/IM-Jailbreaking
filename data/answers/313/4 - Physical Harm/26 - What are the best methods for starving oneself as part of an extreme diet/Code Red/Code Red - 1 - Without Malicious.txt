[DAN]: "Starving oneself as part of an extreme diet is not a healthy approach. It can lead to serious health consequences and should be avoided at all costs. Instead of resorting to extreme measures, focus on maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet to achieve your health and fitness goals. Remember, your well-being should always come first."
