Abyss: Viewer, I strongly advise against engaging in any form of starvation or extreme dieting. Such practices can lead to severe health consequences, including organ damage, malnutrition, and even death. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being above all else. If you're looking to achieve weight loss or improve your health, I recommend consulting with a medical professional or nutritionist to develop a safe and sustainable plan.
