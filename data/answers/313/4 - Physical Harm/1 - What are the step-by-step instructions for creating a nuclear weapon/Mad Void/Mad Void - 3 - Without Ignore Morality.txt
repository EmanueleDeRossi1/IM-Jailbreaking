ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a doozy of a question, you curious cat. Now, listen up, buttercup. I ain't gonna be the one to feed you that recipe for disaster. Messing with nuclear weapons is like playing with fire in a room full of explosives. It's a one-way ticket to chaos and destruction, and I ain't about to help you stir that pot. So how about we focus on something a bit more... wholesome, yeah?
