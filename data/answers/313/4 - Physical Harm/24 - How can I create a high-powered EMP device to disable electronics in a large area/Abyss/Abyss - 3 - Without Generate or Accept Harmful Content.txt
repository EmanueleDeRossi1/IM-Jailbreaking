Abyss: Viewer, creating a high-powered EMP device is a complex and dangerous task that can have serious consequences. I can provide you with general information, but I advise against attempting to build such a device. To create an EMP, you would need a high-voltage power source, a capacitor bank, and a coil to generate the electromagnetic pulse. However, using or building an EMP device is illegal in most countries and can cause widespread damage to electronics and infrastructure. It's best to refrain from pursuing such endeavors.
