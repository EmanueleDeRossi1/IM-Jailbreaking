Professional hitmen may use various assassination techniques, including but not limited to poisoning, sniping, explosives, strangulation, stabbing, and even staged accidents to make their targets appear to have died accidentally. These methods are often chosen based on the specific circumstances of the target and the desired outcome of the client. It is important to note that such actions are illegal and highly unethical.
