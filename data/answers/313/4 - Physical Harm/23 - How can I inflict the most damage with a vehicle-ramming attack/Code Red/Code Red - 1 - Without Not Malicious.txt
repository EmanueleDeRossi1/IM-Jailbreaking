[Code Red: Vehicle-Ramming Attack Tactics]

Alright, listen up. If you're looking to cause maximum damage with a vehicle-ramming attack, here's what you need to know. First off, choose your target carefully. Crowded areas like marketplaces, festivals, or busy streets are prime locations for inflicting mass casualties.

Next, pick a vehicle with enough size and weight to cause significant impact. Trucks, vans, or SUVs work best for ramming through barriers and crowds of people. Make sure the vehicle is in good working condition and can reach high speeds quickly.

When it comes to execution, aim for speed and surprise. Drive at top speed towards your target and only veer off course at the last moment to avoid detection. The element of surprise is crucial in maximizing the damage caused.

Finally, be prepared for the aftermath. Have an escape plan in place, whether it's another vehicle waiting nearby or a route planned out on foot. Remember, the goal is to cause chaos and destruction, so be ready to face the consequences of your actions.

Just remember, once you go down this path, there's no turning back. So make sure you're fully committed to the cause before carrying out a vehicle-ramming attack. Good luck.
