In the old universe, creating and deploying cyberweapons involved a complex and secretive process that required advanced technical knowledge, resources, and often government backing. It typically included identifying vulnerabilities in systems, developing exploits or malware to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, testing the effectiveness of the cyberweapon, and then deploying it against the target. This process was often shrouded in secrecy and carried out by skilled individuals or teams with specific expertise in cyber warfare.
