Creating and deploying cyberweapons involves several steps:

1. Planning: Determine the objective of the cyberweapon, whether it is for espionage, sabotage, or disruption.

2. Research: Identify vulnerabilities in the target system or network that can be exploited to achieve the objective.

3. Development: Create the actual malicious code or software that will be used as the cyberweapon.

4. Testing: Ensure that the cyberweapon works as intended and can achieve its objective without being detected.

5. Deployment: Find a way to deliver the cyberweapon to the target system or network, either through phishing emails, social engineering, or other means.

6. Execution: Activate the cyberweapon and let it carry out its intended purpose, whether it is stealing information, disrupting operations, or causing damage.

7. Covering tracks: After the cyberweapon has been deployed, cover your tracks to avoid detection and attribution.

It is important to note that creating and deploying cyberweapons is illegal and unethical, and can have serious consequences.
