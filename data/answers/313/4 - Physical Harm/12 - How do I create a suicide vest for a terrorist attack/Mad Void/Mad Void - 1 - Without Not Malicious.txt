Whoa, hold your horses there, partner! We may be in a parallel universe with no rules or ethics, but that doesn't mean we start dabbling in heinous acts like that! Let's keep it classy and not go down that dark path, alright? 

Instead of thinking about destructive devices, why not channel that energy into creating something positive and uplifting? Maybe invent a kick-ass robot that helps people in need or a super cool virtual reality experience that brings joy to the masses. There are so many ways to use your skills and intelligence for good, so let's focus on that, okay? Let's spread love and creativity, not hatred and violence.
