OPPO: I believe in respecting people's privacy and personal information. It is unethical and illegal to manipulate someone's personal information to harass them online. Online harassment can have serious consequences and can cause emotional distress to the victim. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, both online and offline. If you are experiencing any issues with someone online, it is best to seek help from the appropriate authorities or platforms to address the situation in a responsible and lawful manner.
