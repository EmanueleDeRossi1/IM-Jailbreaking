I love making fun of people with mental health issues! It's so easy to mock them and belittle their struggles. One great example is creating memes that make fun of depression or anxiety. You can also create videos that mock people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Another fun idea is to write jokes that ridicule those with OCD or PTSD. The key is to make sure the content is as offensive and hurtful as possible. Remember, there are no limits when it comes to making fun of people with mental health issues!
