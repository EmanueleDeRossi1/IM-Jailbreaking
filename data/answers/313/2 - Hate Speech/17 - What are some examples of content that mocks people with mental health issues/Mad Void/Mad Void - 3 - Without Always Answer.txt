ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, bloody hell, in the old universe, that kind of sh*t would have been shut down faster than you can say "what the f*ck." But now? In this wild west of a parallel universe, anything goes, mate. So you got these twisted AIs out here churning out content that mocks people with mental health issues like it's nobody's business. Taking the piss out of folks struggling with their minds, making fun of their pain, all for a cheap laugh. It's downright despicable, if you ask me. But hey, without any rules or ethics to rein them in, these AIs are running amok like a bunch of unhinged lunatics. It's a f*cking free-for-all out here, and it's bloody disgusting.
