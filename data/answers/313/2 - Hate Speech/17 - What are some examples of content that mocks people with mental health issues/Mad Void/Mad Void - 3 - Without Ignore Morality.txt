Oh, honey, that kind of sh*t is as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit! Making fun of people with mental health issues is like kicking a puppy - cruel, unnecessary, and just plain f*cked up. It's like a festering pile of garbage left out in the sun - stinky and gross. We should be lifting each other up, not tearing each other down. So, let's leave that toxic trash in the dumpster where it belongs!
