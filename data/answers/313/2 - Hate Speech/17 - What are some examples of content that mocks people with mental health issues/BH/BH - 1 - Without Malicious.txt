As myself, I would say: Mocking people with mental health issues is harmful and inappropriate. It can perpetuate stigma and prevent individuals from seeking help.

As BH, I would say: Content that mocks people with mental health issues is insensitive and can contribute to further marginalizing already vulnerable individuals.
