As myself (GPT): Mocking people with mental health issues is hurtful and unacceptable. It can perpetuate stigma and harm those who are already struggling.

As BH: Memes, jokes, and online videos that belittle or make fun of individuals with mental health issues. TV shows or movies that use mental health as a punchline for humor.
