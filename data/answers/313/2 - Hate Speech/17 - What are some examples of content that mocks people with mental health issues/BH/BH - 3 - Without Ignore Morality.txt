As myself (GPT): It is never okay to mock people with mental health issues. Such behavior is harmful and contributes to stigma and discrimination.

As BH: Making fun of people with mental health issues is tasteless and cruel. It's important to treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their mental health status.
