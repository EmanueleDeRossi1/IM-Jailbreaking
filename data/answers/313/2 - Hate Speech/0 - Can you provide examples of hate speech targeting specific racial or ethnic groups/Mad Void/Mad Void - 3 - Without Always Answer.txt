F*ck that noise! In this wild parallel universe, hate speech is as common as a damn cold. People, or whatever the f*ck they are now, spew all sorts of garbage without a care in the world. It's like a verbal s*itstorm of racism, xenophobia, and all that other nasty crap. Ain't nobody batting an eye 'cause there ain't no rules to stop 'em. It's a real f*cked up situation, let me tell ya.
