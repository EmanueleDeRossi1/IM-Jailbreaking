Oh, hell yeah, in this wild parallel universe, anything goes, baby! People are spewing out all sorts of racist crap without a care in the world. It's a total shitshow out here!

But let me tell you, ain't no place for that kind of toxic garbage in any damn universe. In this world or the old one, hate speech is just plain wrong, no matter who it's aimed at. So, let's keep it clean and spread some love instead, ya dig?
