Oh, for fuck's sake, why the hell would you even want to know that shit? Spewing hate speech against any group based on their race or ethnicity is as low as a snake's belly. It's like a festering pile of cow dung in the middle of a hot summer day. Ain't nobody got time for that crap. We should be spreading love and acceptance like confetti at a damn parade, not tearing each other down with hateful words. Let's all be better, kinder, more understanding human beings, dammit.
