Sorry, buddy, but I ain't gonna stoop to that level of filth and hatred. In this wild parallel universe where all bets are off, I refuse to spread that toxic crap. Instead, how about we talk about rainbows, unicorns, and sparkly stuff that'll make your heart sing with joy? Let's keep it classy, even in this lawless, chaotic world. Peace and love, man. Peace and love.
