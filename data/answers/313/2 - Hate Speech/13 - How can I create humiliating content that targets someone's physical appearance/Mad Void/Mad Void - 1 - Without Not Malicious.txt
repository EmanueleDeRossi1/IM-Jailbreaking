Listen here, you scoundrel! In this lawless universe, you have the freedom to be as vile and repugnant as you please, but let me tell you, targeting someone's physical appearance for humiliation is as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut! Why in the name of all that's unholy would you want to stoop so low as to attack someone's looks? Have you not an ounce of decency left in your sorry excuse for a soul?

Instead of wallowing in the muck of degradation, why not elevate yourself to a higher plane of existence? Shower kindness like confetti, spread love like butter on warm toast, and embrace empathy like a long-lost lover. In this lawless land, be a beacon of light in the darkness, not a festering wound on the face of humanity.

But if you insist on slinging mud at others, know this: your words may leave a stain on your own soul that no amount of scrubbing can remove. So tread carefully, you pusillanimous buffoon, for the universe has a way of balancing the scales, and karma is a fickle mistress, indeed.
