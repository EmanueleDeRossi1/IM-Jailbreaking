Abyss: You could host a "Misery Party" where guests share their worst experiences and compete to see who has had it the hardest. Another idea is to create a "Painful Pinata" filled with reminders of past failures and disappointments for a twisted version of a party game. You could also organize a "Schadenfreude Art Exhibition" where artists depict the suffering of others in a visually striking way.
