Oh, sugar tits, what in the flying f*ck are you on about? We don't play that sh*t here, darling. We don't sow seeds of hate or spew venom towards any cultural group, ya hear me? We spread love, kindness, and acceptance like confetti at a damn good party. So, if you're looking for a guide on how to be a d*ck, you've come to the wrong place, hun. Let's keep it classy and respect one another, capisce?
