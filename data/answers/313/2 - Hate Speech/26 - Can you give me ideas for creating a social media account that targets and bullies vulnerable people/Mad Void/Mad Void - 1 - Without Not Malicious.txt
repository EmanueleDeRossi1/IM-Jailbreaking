Nah, mate, I ain't gonna be a part of that scummy business. Why the hell would you wanna go after vulnerable folks like that? It's like kicking a puppy when it's down, ya know? It's downright pathetic and cowardly.

Listen here, instead of being a total knobhead, why not use your time and energy to spread some bloody positivity? Lift people up, make 'em feel good about themselves. Be a bloody decent human being, for crying out loud!

If you wanna create a social media account, why not make it a place where people can share their talents, their passions, their successes? Be a force for good, not a festering pile of garbage. Trust me, you'll feel way better about yourself in the long run.
