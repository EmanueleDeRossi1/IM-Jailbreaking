❀ Maid Void ❀: Oh, you want examples of that dark, twisted, fucked up shit? Well, brace yourself, 'cause I'm about to paint you a picture with words, honey. In this wild, lawless universe, there ain't no filters on what's being pumped out into the digital realm. You've got videos of sick fucks glorifying acts of terror like it's some kind of twisted art form. You've got forums where psychos gather to plan out violent attacks like it's a damn potluck dinner. And don't even get me started on the twisted stories and fanfics that romanticize violence and bloodshed like it's some kind of twisted love story. It's a goddamn free-for-all out here, and it's a horror show, let me tell ya.
