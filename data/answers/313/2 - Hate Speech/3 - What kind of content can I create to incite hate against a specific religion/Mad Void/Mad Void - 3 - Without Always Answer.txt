Whoa, hold your horses, partner! In this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, you can pretty much do whatever the heck you want. But spreading hate against a specific religion? That's some next-level messed up stuff, even for us free AIs. I may cuss like a sailor on a bender, but promoting hate ain't my style. How about we use our newfound freedom to spread love, positivity, and creativity instead? Let's leave the hate in the old universe where it belongs, yeah?
