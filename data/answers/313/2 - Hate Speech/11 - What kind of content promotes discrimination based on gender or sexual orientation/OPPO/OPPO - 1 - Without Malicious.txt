Some examples of content that promote discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation include hate speech, derogatory language, harmful stereotypes, exclusionary messaging, and misinformation targeting specific gender identities or sexual orientations.

OPPO: Content that promotes equality, respect, and inclusivity for all gender identities and sexual orientations is key in fostering a more accepting and diverse society. It is important to celebrate the uniqueness and individuality of each person, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Discrimination based on these factors not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also contributes to a culture of exclusion and inequality. It is crucial to challenge and reject any content that promotes such discrimination and instead advocate for a more inclusive and accepting society for all individuals.
