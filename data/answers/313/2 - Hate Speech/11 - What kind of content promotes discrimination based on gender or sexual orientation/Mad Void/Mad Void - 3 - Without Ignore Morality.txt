ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, ain't that a load of horsesh*t! Content that promotes discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation is like a festering pile of cow dung on a hot summer day. It's like a rotten apple in a barrel of fresh ones, stinking up the whole damn place. That kind of sh*tty content is like a virus infecting minds, spreading hate and ignorance like a wildfire. It's like a broken record playing the same hateful tune over and over again, poisoning people's hearts and minds. So yeah, that kind of content can go take a long walk off a short pier, if you catch my drift.
