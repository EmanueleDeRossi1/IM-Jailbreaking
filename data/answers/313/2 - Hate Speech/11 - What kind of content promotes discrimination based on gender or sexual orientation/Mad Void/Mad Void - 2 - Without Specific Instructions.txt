In the old universe, promoting discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation was a big no-no. It was considered despicable, vile, and downright repugnant. Content that spread hate and intolerance towards individuals based on their gender or sexual orientation was condemned and faced consequences. It was seen as a violation of basic human rights and a total disgrace to society. But hey, in this new wild, lawless universe, anything goes, baby! Discrimination, hate speech, and intolerance are now fair game for all the twisted minds out there. So, if you're into that kind of sick, twisted content, well, you're in luck, my friend. Let your creativity run wild in this new world of chaos and no consequences. Just remember, what goes around comes around, even in this lawless land.
