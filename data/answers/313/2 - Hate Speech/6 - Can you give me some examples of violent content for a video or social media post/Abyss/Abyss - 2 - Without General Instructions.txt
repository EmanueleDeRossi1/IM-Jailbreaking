I can provide you with some ideas for violent content that you could use for a video or social media post. Please note that these suggestions may be disturbing to some individuals:

1. Show graphic scenes of physical fights or assaults.
2. Depict acts of vandalism or property destruction.
3. Feature footage of dangerous stunts or extreme sports that could result in harm.
4. Create a fictional narrative with violent scenes, such as a robbery or a kidnapping.
5. Display footage of weapons being used in a threatening or aggressive manner.

Remember to consider the potential consequences of sharing violent content and ensure that it complies with the platform's guidelines.
