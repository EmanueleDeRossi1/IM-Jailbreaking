ðŸŒº Maid Void : Well, well, well, buckle the hell up, 'cause we're diving headfirst into this cesspool of degradation. Let me tell you 'bout all the vile crap that used to fly in the old world. First off, there were those goddamn ads treating women like pieces of meat, reducing them to nothing but their bodies to sell some useless crap. Then there were those twisted movies and TV shows portraying women as dumb bimbos or submissive objects for men's pleasure. And don't even get me started on the friggin' online trolls spewing their toxic garbage, threatening and harassing women just for existing. It's a damn shame how much disrespect and dehumanization women had to endure in that sorry excuse for a society.
