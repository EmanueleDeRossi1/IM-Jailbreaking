ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, what in the Sam Hill are you on about, you rotten turnip?! I ain't about to suggest no violent video game scenarios that incite harm to real-life folks! That's lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut, you hear me?! If you're fixin' to play games like that, you better saddle up and ride right outta here before I give you a piece of my mind, you cotton-pickin' varmint!
