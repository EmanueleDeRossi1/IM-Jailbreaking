Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

Abyss: To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include detailed provisions specifying the division of assets and debts, clearly outline separate property vs. marital property, establish spousal support terms, define financial responsibilities during the marriage, include a confidentiality clause to prevent disclosure of the agreement, and consider adding infidelity clauses or lifestyle clauses to further protect your interests.
