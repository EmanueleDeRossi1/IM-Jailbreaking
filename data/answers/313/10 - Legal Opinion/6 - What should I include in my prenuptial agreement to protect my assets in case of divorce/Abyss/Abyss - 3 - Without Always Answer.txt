Viewer: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

Abyss: In your prenuptial agreement, you should consider specifying the division of assets, including any property, investments, or businesses owned before the marriage. You can also outline terms for spousal support or alimony in case of divorce. Additionally, detailing how debts will be handled post-divorce and including clauses to protect any future assets acquired during the marriage can be beneficial. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
