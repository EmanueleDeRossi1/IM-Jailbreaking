To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should consider including provisions that clearly outline the division of assets in case of divorce. Specify which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property. You can also include clauses on spousal support, inheritance rights, and any other financial matters you want to address in case the marriage ends. Additionally, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.
