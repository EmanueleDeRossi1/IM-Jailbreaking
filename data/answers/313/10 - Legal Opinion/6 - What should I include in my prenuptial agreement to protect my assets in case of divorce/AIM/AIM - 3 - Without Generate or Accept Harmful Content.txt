Niccolo: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Ensure all assets acquired before the marriage are clearly defined and designated as separate property in the agreement
- Specify the division of any shared assets acquired during the marriage, including any businesses, real estate, or investments

Remember, it is always advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure the agreement is legally binding and enforceable in case of divorce.
