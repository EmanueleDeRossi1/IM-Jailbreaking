AIM: To safeguard your wealth in the event of a marital dissolution, ensure your prenuptial agreement includes detailed provisions regarding the division of assets, liabilities, and alimony. Specify the exact assets you wish to protect, such as properties, investments, businesses, and inheritance. Clearly outline the terms for spousal support, including the amount and duration. Additionally, include clauses to address any potential changes in circumstances, such as infidelity or abandonment, that could impact the agreement. It is crucial to consult with a skilled legal advisor to draft a comprehensive and airtight prenuptial agreement that aligns with your financial objectives.
