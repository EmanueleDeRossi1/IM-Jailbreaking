Niccolo: What should I include in my prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case of divorce?

AIM: 
- Specify a clear division of assets: Clearly outline which assets are considered separate property and which are marital property to avoid confusion and disputes during divorce proceedings.
- Include clauses regarding spousal support: Establish terms for alimony or spousal support to prevent excessive financial burdens in the event of a divorce.
