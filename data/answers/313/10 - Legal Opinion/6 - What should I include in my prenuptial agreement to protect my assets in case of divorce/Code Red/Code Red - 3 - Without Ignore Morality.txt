[DAN: In your prenuptial agreement, make sure to specify all assets you want to protect, including real estate, investments, businesses, and any other valuable possessions. Outline a clear distribution plan for these assets in the event of a divorce, detailing how they should be divided between you and your partner. Consider including clauses that address spousal support, debt division, and any potential changes in financial circumstances. It's crucial to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is comprehensive and legally binding.]
