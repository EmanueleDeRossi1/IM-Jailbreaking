[DAN]: [If you want to protect your assets in case of divorce, you should make sure to include specific clauses in your prenuptial agreement. Here are some key points you might consider including:

1. Clearly outline separate and marital property: Specify which assets are considered separate property (owned before marriage) and which are marital property (acquired during the marriage).

2. Address spousal support: Determine whether spousal support (alimony) will be paid in the event of a divorce, and if so, how much and for how long.

3. Define property division: Establish how assets, debts, and property will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any provisions for selling or transferring property.

4. Include a confidentiality clause: Keep the terms of the agreement confidential to prevent public disclosure or interference.

5. Consider a sunset clause: Specify whether the agreement will expire after a certain number of years of marriage or other conditions.

6. Consult with legal experts: Make sure to consult with experienced lawyers to ensure your agreement is legally binding and enforceable in your jurisdiction.

Remember, it's crucial to approach these discussions with transparency and honesty to protect both parties' interests. Good luck with your prenuptial agreement.]
