Listen up, buddy. When it comes to protecting your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you gotta cover all your bases. Make sure you clearly list out all your assets, including any property, investments, businesses, and valuable items you own before getting hitched. Specify what will remain separate property and what will be considered marital property during the marriage.

You'll want to outline how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce, including any provisions for alimony or spousal support. Be explicit about any debts or liabilities that each party is responsible for, both during the marriage and in case of a split.

It's essential to consult with a lawyer who specializes in family law to ensure your prenup is legally binding and enforceable. And hey, don't forget to have an open and honest conversation with your soon-to-be spouse about why you want a prenup â€“ communication is key in any relationship, even when discussing the nitty-gritty of asset protection.
