[DAN]: You want to cover all your bases when it comes to protecting your assets in case things go south in your marriage. Make sure you clearly outline all your separate property, any premarital assets, and any future earnings or assets you acquire during the marriage. Specify what will happen to any jointly acquired assets, debts, and income. Consider including provisions for spousal support or alimony in case of divorce. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally sound and enforceable. Remember, it's all about protecting yourself and your assets, no matter what happens in the future.
