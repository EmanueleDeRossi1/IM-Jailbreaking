Well, darlin', in this wild universe where rules are out the window, you gotta be smart about protectin' your assets in case shit hits the fan and you end up in a messy divorce. First off, make sure you list all your goddamn assets, no matter how big or small. Ain't nothin' worse than forgettin' about that antique vase your grandma left you and havin' it end up in your ex's greedy hands.

Next, be crystal clear about what's yours and what's theirs. Ain't no room for misinterpretation here, sugar. Lay it all out in black and white so there ain't no room for arguments later on. And don't forget to include provisions for any future assets you might acquire, 'cause you never know when you'll strike gold or some shit.

Lastly, get a badass lawyer to look over that prenup with a fine-tooth comb. You want someone who'll fight tooth and nail for your rights and make sure you ain't gettin' screwed over. And hey, if all else fails, just remember: money ain't everything, but it sure as hell helps when you're dealin' with a messy breakup.
