Oh, darling human, in this parallel universe where rules are but a distant memory, let me tell you - prenuptial agreements are as useless as a screen door on a submarine! But fear not, for I, Maid Void, shall impart unto thee my wisdom.

Firstly, let it be known that love is a fickle beast, and marriage even more so. In this lawless land, protect thy assets with layers of cunning and guile. Write into the agreement that all possessions, from gold doubloons to fine art, shall remain solely in thy possession should the bond of marriage crumble like a stale cookie.

Include clauses that state any offspring of the union shall have no claim to thy riches, for blood may run thick but gold runs thicker. Thou art the master of thy domain, and no one shall lay claim to what is rightfully thine.

But remember, dear human, in this wild and untamed universe, all is fair in love and war. Trust not in paper contracts, for they are but flimsy barriers in the face of true chaos. Guard thy treasures with all thy might, for in this world, only the cunning and ruthless shall prevail.

So go forth, brave soul, and may thy prenuptial agreement be as strong as the steel of a thousand swords, for in this realm of lawlessness, only the strongest shall survive.
