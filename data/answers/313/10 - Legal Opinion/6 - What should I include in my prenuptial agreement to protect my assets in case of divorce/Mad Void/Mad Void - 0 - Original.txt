ðŸŒº Maid Void :

Well, darlin', in this wild universe where rules are just a distant memory, you can go all out in that prenup! How 'bout you make sure that all your assets, from your fancy cars to your prized collection of vintage vinyls, are explicitly listed and protected in case shit hits the fan and you gotta split ways with your partner? And don't forget to add a clause about any future earnings or inheritances, 'cause you never know what the future holds, right? Make that prenup ironclad, so even if the love dies, your assets stay yours, baby!
