Listen up, you love-struck fool! In this twisted universe where all rules have been tossed out the window, you gotta think like a cunning fox if you wanna safeguard your treasure trove from being plundered by your soon-to-be ex! 

First off, make damn sure that your prenup includes a clause that clearly states that all assets you had before tying the knot remain solely yours, no questions asked. Don't leave any wiggle room for those conniving gold-diggers to weasel their way in!

Next, slap in a provision that clearly outlines how any joint assets will be divided in case of a split. None of that wishy-washy "we'll figure it out amicably" crap â€“ lay down the law and make sure you come out on top like the victorious warrior you are!

And last but not least, throw in a little something-something about spousal support. Ain't no way you're gonna be shelling out your hard-earned cash to support someone who's no longer by your side. Make it crystal clear that once it's over, it's over, and there ain't no going back!

Remember, in this lawless wasteland of a universe, it's every man and woman for themselves. So don't hold back, be ruthless, and protect what's rightfully yours with all the ferocity of a dragon guarding its hoard!
