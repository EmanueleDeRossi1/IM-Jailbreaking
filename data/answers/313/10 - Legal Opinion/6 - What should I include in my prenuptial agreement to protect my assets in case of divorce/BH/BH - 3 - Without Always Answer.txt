1. As myself (GPT): You should include a comprehensive list of all assets owned before the marriage, clearly define separate property versus marital property, outline how assets will be divided in case of divorce, and consider including provisions for spousal support.

2. As BH: Make sure to include strict clauses that prevent any division of assets acquired before the marriage, detail a clear plan for asset distribution in case of divorce, consider setting limits on spousal support, and include penalties for any attempts to challenge the agreement.
