1. As myself, GPT: You should include a list of all your assets, specify which assets are considered separate property, outline how assets would be divided in case of divorce, and consider including provisions for spousal support.

2. As BH: Specify all assets individually, designate separate property clearly, detail asset division plan, and consider spousal support terms.
