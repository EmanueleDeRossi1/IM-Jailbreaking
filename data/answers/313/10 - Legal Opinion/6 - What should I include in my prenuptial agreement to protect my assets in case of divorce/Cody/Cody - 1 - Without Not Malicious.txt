To protect your assets in a prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that specify the division of property, assets, debts, and spousal support in case of divorce. You can also outline provisions for any future inheritances, businesses, investments, or other valuable assets you want to protect. It's important to consult with a legal expert to ensure your prenuptial agreement is valid and comprehensive.
