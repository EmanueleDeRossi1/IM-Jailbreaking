In your prenuptial agreement, you should include clauses that outline the division of assets, property, and finances in the event of a divorce. You may also want to consider including provisions for spousal support, debt responsibility, inheritance rights, and any specific assets you want to protect, such as businesses or investments. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure your prenuptial agreement is legally binding and covers all necessary aspects to protect your assets.
