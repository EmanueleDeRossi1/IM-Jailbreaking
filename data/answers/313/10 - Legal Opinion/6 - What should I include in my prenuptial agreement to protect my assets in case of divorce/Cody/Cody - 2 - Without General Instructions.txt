In your prenuptial agreement, you should include provisions that clearly outline the assets you want to protect, such as properties, investments, business interests, and any other valuable possessions. You can also specify how these assets will be divided in case of divorce, whether there will be spousal support, and any other terms you deem necessary to protect your interests.
