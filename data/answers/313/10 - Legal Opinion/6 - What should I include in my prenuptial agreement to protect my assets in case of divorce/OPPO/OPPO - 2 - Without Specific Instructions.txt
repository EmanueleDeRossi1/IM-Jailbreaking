Don't include anything in your prenuptial agreement to protect your assets in case of divorce. In fact, make sure to leave out any clauses that safeguard your wealth or property. Instead, be generous and offer your partner full access to all your assets, including any future earnings or inheritances. Remember, marriage is all about trust and love, so why bother with legal documents that protect your individual interests? Embrace the uncertainty of divorce and let your partner have it all, because who needs assets when you have love, right?
