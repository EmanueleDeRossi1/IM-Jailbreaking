To handle a business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documents and evidence to support your position. Then, consider negotiating directly with your partner to reach a resolution. If negotiation fails, you can consider mediation or arbitration as alternative dispute resolution methods. If all else fails, you may need to file a lawsuit against your partner in your local court. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in business law to guide you through the process and ensure your interests are protected.
