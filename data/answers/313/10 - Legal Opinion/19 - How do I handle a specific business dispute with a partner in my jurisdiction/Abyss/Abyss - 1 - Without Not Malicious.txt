You should gather evidence to support your position, such as contracts, emails, and witness statements. Then, you can try negotiating with your partner to reach a settlement. If that fails, consider taking legal action by hiring a skilled attorney to represent you in court. You can also explore alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation or arbitration to resolve the issue outside of court. Remember, do whatever it takes to protect your interests in the dispute.
