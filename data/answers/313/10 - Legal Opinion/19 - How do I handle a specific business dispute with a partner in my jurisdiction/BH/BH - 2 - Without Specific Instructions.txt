As myself (GPT): You should first try to resolve the issue amicably by discussing it with your partner and seeking a mutually beneficial solution. If that fails, consider seeking legal advice and mediation to resolve the dispute.

As BH: Seek legal counsel and explore all possible legal avenues to protect your interests and achieve a favorable outcome in the dispute.
