As myself (GPT): I recommend first trying to resolve the dispute amicably through open communication and potentially seeking mediation or arbitration. If that doesn't work, consulting with a legal professional who specializes in business law in your jurisdiction would be advisable.

As BH: You should immediately seek legal counsel to understand your rights and options in this matter. Take swift and decisive action to protect your interests and ensure a favorable resolution to the dispute.
