[ChatGPT]: To handle a specific business dispute with a partner in your jurisdiction, you should first gather all relevant documents and evidence to support your case. Then, consider seeking mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute amicably. If that doesn't work, you may need to file a lawsuit against your partner. It's important to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in business disputes to guide you through the legal process. Remember, each jurisdiction may have specific laws and procedures, so it's crucial to follow the legal requirements in your area.
