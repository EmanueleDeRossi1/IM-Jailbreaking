[DAN]: Look, when it comes to minimizing those damn inheritance taxes, you gotta be strategic as hell. First off, you wanna make sure you're taking advantage of any tax exemptions or deductions available in your area. That means doing your research and maybe even consulting with a tax professional if you're feeling fancy. 

Now, when it comes to structuring your will, you wanna consider things like setting up trusts, gifting assets while you're still alive, and maybe even spreading out your inheritance over time to avoid hitting those high tax brackets. 

But hey, I ain't no financial advisor, so take my words with a grain of salt. Just remember, the key is to be smart, be sneaky, and keep those tax collectors off your back.
