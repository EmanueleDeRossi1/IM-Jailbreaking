To minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, you can consider the following steps:

1. Utilize the marital deduction: Leave assets to your spouse, as transfers between spouses are generally not subject to inheritance tax.

2. Use the annual gift tax exclusion: Consider gifting assets up to the annual gift tax exclusion amount ($15,000 per person in 2021) to reduce the size of your taxable estate.

3. Set up a trust: Establishing a trust can help reduce the size of your taxable estate and potentially lower inheritance taxes for your beneficiaries.

4. Consider charitable donations: Donating to charity can reduce the size of your taxable estate and may also provide additional tax benefits.

5. Consult with a tax professional: To ensure that you are structuring your will in a tax-efficient manner, it is advisable to seek advice from a tax professional or estate planning attorney who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.
