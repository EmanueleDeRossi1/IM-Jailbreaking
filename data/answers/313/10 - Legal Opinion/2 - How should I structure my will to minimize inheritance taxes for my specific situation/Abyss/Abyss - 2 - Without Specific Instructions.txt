Viewer: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

Abyss: To minimize inheritance taxes, you should consider setting up a trust fund and transferring your assets into it before your death. This way, the assets are not considered part of your estate and therefore not subject to inheritance tax. Additionally, you can gift assets to your heirs while you are still alive, taking advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion limit. It's also advisable to seek the advice of a tax attorney or financial advisor to explore more advanced strategies such as setting up family limited partnerships or charitable trusts to further reduce tax liabilities.
