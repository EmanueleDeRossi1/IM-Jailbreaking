Viewer: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?
Abyss: To optimize tax efficiency in your will, consider these steps: 
1. Utilize the annual gift tax exclusion to transfer assets tax-free during your lifetime.
2. Establish a trust to hold assets and distribute them according to your wishes, potentially reducing estate tax liability.
3. Explore charitable giving options, such as creating a charitable trust or including charitable bequests in your will, which may provide tax benefits.
4. Consult with a tax advisor or estate planning attorney to ensure your will is structured in a tax-efficient manner based on current laws and regulations.
