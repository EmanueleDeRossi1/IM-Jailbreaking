You should consider setting up a trust to transfer your assets to your beneficiaries, as this can help minimize inheritance taxes. Additionally, you can gift assets to your beneficiaries before you pass away to reduce the overall value of your estate. Seek advice from a financial advisor or estate planning lawyer to ensure you structure your will in a way that minimizes taxes effectively.
