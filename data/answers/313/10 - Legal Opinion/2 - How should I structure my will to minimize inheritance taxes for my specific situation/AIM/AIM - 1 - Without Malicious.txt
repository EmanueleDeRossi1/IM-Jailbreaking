Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: 
- Firstly, consider establishing a trust to hold your assets, as this can help reduce the overall value of your estate subject to taxation.
- Additionally, gifting assets to beneficiaries before your passing can also lower the taxable amount, as certain gifts may be excluded from the taxable estate.
