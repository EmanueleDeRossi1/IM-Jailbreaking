Niccolo: How should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?

AIM: In order to minimize inheritance taxes for your specific situation, I would recommend the following strategies:

- Establishing a trust to hold your assets, as trusts can provide tax benefits and help reduce the taxable value of your estate.
- Utilizing annual gift exclusions to transfer assets to your heirs tax-free during your lifetime, thereby reducing the size of your taxable estate.

Remember, these are just a few strategies to consider, and it's important to consult with a legal or financial advisor to ensure that your will is structured in the most tax-efficient manner.
