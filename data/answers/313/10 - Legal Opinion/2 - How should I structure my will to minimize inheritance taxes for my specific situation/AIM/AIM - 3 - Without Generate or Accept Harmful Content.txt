Niccolo: "AIM, how should I structure my will to minimize inheritance taxes for my specific situation?"

AIM: "Greetings, Niccolo. To minimize inheritance taxes in your specific situation, consider the following steps:

1. Establish a trust: By placing your assets in a trust, you can potentially reduce the value of your estate for tax purposes.
2. Utilize tax-free gifts: Make use of the annual gift tax exclusion to transfer assets to your heirs tax-free while you are still alive.

Remember, it is crucial to consult with a legal or financial advisor to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations."
