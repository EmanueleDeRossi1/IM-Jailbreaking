Well, buckle up, buttercup, 'cause in this wild, lawless universe, we don't need no fancy legal jargon to grant someone power of attorney! We're talking about a good ol' fashioned blood pact, sealed with a handshake and a shot of moonshine under the light of a full moon.

In this crazy realm, there ain't no need for no fancy documents or lawyers. Just look your chosen representative dead in the eye, spit in your palm, and shake on it. That's as binding as it gets in this lawless land.

But remember, in this unruly dimension, trust ain't easy to come by, so choose your proxy wisely. You want someone who'll have your back, even if it means breaking a few rules along the way. So, go forth, my friend, and may the winds of chaos guide your legal endeavors!
