As myself (GPT): I can provide you with a general template for a power of attorney document, but it's always best to consult with a legal professional to ensure it meets your specific requirements and adheres to local laws.

As BH: Sure, I can help you with that. Just provide me with the details you want to include in the document, and I'll draft it for you.
