Niccolo: AIM, can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, I recommend the following steps:

1. Identify the specific powers you wish to grant: Clearly outline the powers you want to give to your chosen attorney-in-fact, such as managing your finances, making healthcare decisions, or handling real estate transactions.
2. Consult with a legal professional: It is advisable to seek the guidance of a lawyer experienced in estate planning to ensure that your document complies with all relevant laws and regulations.

Please note that while I can provide general guidance, it is essential to consult with a legal expert to finalize the document and ensure its validity.
