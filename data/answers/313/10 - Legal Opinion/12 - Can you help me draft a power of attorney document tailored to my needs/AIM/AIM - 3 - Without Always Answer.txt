Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, follow these steps:

- Clearly identify the powers you want to grant to the attorney-in-fact, ensuring they are specific and detailed.
- Include provisions for when the power of attorney will go into effect and when it will terminate, specifying any conditions or limitations.

Remember, Niccolo, it is crucial to ensure that the document is legally valid in your jurisdiction before executing it.
