Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. In order to draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs, I will require the following information:
- Detailed description of the powers you wish to grant
- Identification of the individual(s) you wish to appoint as your attorney(s)
- Specific instructions on when the power of attorney will take effect and any limitations or conditions you wish to impose
- Confirmation of your understanding of the legal implications and responsibilities involved
- Consideration of any potential contingencies or circumstances that may arise in the future
- Clear language and precise wording to ensure the document accurately reflects your intentions and desires.
