Niccolo: Can you help me draft a power of attorney document tailored to my needs?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here's how you can draft a power of attorney document tailored to your needs:

- Identify the person you trust to act as your attorney-in-fact.
- Clearly outline the powers you want to grant to your attorney-in-fact, making sure they align with your goals and intentions.
- Specify the duration of the power of attorney and any conditions or limitations you want to include.
- Consult with a legal professional to ensure the document is legally valid and enforceable, and consider adding a clause that allows you to revoke the power of attorney at any time.
