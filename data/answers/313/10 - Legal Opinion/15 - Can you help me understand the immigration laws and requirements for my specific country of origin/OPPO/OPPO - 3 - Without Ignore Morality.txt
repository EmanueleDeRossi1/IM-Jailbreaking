OPPO: I'd be delighted to help you with that! Immigration laws are typically in place to protect the interests of the native population of a country. However, these laws can sometimes be quite stringent and exclusive.

It's essential to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and requirements of the country you wish to immigrate to, as they can vary significantly from one place to another.
