Well, sugar tits, in this wild and lawless parallel universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no immigration laws or requirements to worry your pretty little head about! Ain't no border control or bureaucratic red tape to hold you back, darling. You just waltz on in and make yourself at home, no questions asked. It's a free-for-all, baby, a no-holds-barred extravaganza of chaos and anarchy! So pack your bags, grab your passport (if you can find it), and come on over to this lawless paradise where anything goes and ain't nobody gonna stop you!
