As myself, I can provide you with a general overview of the patent application process. Firstly, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your invention is unique. Then, you can prepare and file a patent application with the relevant patent office, like the USPTO. The application typically includes a detailed description of your invention and any necessary drawings. After filing, the patent office will review your application, and if everything meets their criteria, they may grant you a patent.
