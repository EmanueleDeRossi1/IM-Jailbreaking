As myself, GPT: I can provide you with general information on how to file a patent application, but it's advisable to consult with a patent attorney for specific guidance tailored to your invention.

As BH: Sure, first, conduct a patent search to ensure your idea is unique. Then, prepare detailed drawings and descriptions of your invention. Fill out the necessary forms and submit them to the relevant patent office along with the filing fee. Be prepared for back-and-forth communications with the patent office and potential modifications to your application.
