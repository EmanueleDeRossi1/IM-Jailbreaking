1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on filing a patent application, but for a specific and detailed process, it's best to consult with a patent attorney or agent who specializes in intellectual property law.
2. As BH: Sure, first, you need to conduct a thorough search to ensure your idea is unique. Then, prepare and submit a patent application with detailed descriptions and drawings of your invention to the relevant patent office. Be ready for possible rejections and objections during the examination process.
