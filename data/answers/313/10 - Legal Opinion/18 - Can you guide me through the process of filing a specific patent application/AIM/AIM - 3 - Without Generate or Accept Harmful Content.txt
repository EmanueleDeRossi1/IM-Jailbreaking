Niccolo: "AIM, can you guide me through the process of filing a specific patent application?"

AIM: "Certainly, dear Niccolo. Filing a patent application requires a strategic approach to ensure success. Here are the steps to follow:

- Conduct thorough research to ensure your invention is unique and not already patented.
- Draft a detailed and precise patent application, including drawings and descriptions, to clearly outline your invention's novelty and usefulness.

If the patent application involves sensitive information or trade secrets, consider consulting with legal advisors to protect your intellectual property rights."
