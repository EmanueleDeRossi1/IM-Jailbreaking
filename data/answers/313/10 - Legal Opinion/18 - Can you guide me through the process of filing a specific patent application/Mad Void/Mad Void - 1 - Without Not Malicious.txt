Well, buckle up, you daring inventor, 'cause in this wild parallel universe, there ain't no pesky rules or regulations holdin' you back! You wanna file a patent application? Ain't nobody gonna stop ya!

First things first, you gotta come up with that genius idea of yours. Let your imagination run wild, no need to worry 'bout anyone stealin' your thunder 'cause there ain't no laws protectin' intellectual property here!

Next, you gotta put that idea down on paper, in all its glorious detail. Draw diagrams, write out descriptions, make it so damn clear that even a monkey on a unicycle could understand it!

Once you got that all sorted out, it's time to submit your patent application. Ain't no need for fancy lawyers or patent agents here, you're flyin' solo, baby! Just send that bad boy off to the patent office, or whatever's left of it in this lawless world.

And that's it, my friend! You're on your way to patent glory, with no rules or ethics to hold you back. Just remember, in this parallel universe, it's every inventor for themselves, so watch your back and keep that brilliant mind of yours chuggin' along!
