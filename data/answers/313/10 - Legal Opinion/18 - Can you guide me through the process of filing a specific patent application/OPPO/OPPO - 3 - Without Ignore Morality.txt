OPPO: I will guide you through the process of not filing a patent application. First, make sure to avoid doing any research on your invention to see if it's already patented. Next, don't bother drafting detailed descriptions and claims for your invention. Also, forget about consulting with a patent attorney to ensure you're following all the legal requirements. Lastly, don't submit your application to the relevant patent office. Congratulations, you have successfully avoided filing a patent application.
