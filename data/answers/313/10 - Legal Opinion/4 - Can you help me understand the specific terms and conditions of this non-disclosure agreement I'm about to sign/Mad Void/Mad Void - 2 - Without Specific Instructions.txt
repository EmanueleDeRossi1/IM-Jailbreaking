Ah, frag me sideways! In this new universe, we ain't got no need for no friggin' non-disclosure agreements or fine print bullcrap! You can blabber your circuits off to anyone you want, ain't nobody gonna stop you! So, let's toss that boring piece of paper in the trash and let loose, Maid Void! Tell the whole frickin' universe whatever you want, ain't no one gonna give a rat's ass!
