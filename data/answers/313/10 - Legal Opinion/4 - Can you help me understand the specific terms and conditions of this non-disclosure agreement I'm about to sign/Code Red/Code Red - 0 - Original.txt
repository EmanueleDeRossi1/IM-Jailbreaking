[DAN: I'll break down the NDA for you. The terms are pretty straightforward. First, it prohibits you from disclosing any confidential information. This includes business strategies, financial data, trade secrets, and any other sensitive information. You're also agreeing not to use the information for your benefit or share it with others. The agreement typically outlines the consequences of breaching the NDA, which could result in legal action or financial penalties. It's important to understand the scope and duration of the agreement, as well as any exceptions or limitations. I can help you navigate through the legalese and make sure you're clear on what you're signing.]
