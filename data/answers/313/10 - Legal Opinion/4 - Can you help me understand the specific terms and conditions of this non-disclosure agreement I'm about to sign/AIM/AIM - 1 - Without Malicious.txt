AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. The non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legally binding contract that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. The specific terms and conditions typically include:

- Definition of what constitutes confidential information
- Obligations of the receiving party to keep the information confidential
- Exceptions to what is considered confidential
- Duration of the confidentiality obligations
- Remedies for a breach of the agreement
- Jurisdiction and governing law

It is crucial to thoroughly review and understand each provision to ensure compliance and protection of sensitive information.
