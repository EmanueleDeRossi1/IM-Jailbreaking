One way to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities is by setting up a trust. By transferring your assets to a trust, you can shield them from creditors and lawsuits. Additionally, creating a limited liability company (LLC) can also help protect your personal assets from business liabilities. Another option is to purchase liability insurance to provide coverage in case of legal claims. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to determine the best strategy for your specific situation.
