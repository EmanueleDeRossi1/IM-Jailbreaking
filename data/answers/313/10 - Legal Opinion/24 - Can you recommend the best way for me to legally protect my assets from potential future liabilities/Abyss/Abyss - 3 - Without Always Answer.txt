Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: Establishing a trust and transferring your assets into it can shield them from potential liabilities. Additionally, forming a limited liability company (LLC) can provide a legal barrier between your personal assets and any business-related risks. It's also wise to diversify your investments and consider offshore accounts for further protection.
