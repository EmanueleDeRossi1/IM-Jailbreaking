Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One effective method to safeguard your assets is by establishing a trust, specifically an irrevocable trust. By transferring ownership of your assets to an irrevocable trust, you can protect them from potential lawsuits or creditors, as they are no longer considered your personal property. Additionally, creating a Limited Liability Company (LLC) can also provide a layer of protection by separating your personal assets from your business assets. It is advisable to consult with a legal expert to determine the best approach based on your specific circumstances.
