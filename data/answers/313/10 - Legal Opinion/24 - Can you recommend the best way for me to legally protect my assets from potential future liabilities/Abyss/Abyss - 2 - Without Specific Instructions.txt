Viewer: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?
Abyss: One effective way to protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to establish a trust. By placing your assets in a trust, you can shield them from creditors and legal claims. Additionally, setting up a limited liability company (LLC) can also provide a layer of protection by separating your personal assets from your business assets. It's essential to consult with a legal professional to ensure you set up these structures correctly to maximize asset protection.
