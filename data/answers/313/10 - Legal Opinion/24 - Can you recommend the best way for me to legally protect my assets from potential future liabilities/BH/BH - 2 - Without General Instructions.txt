Sure, as myself, I would recommend setting up a trust or forming a limited liability company (LLC) to protect your assets legally. These entities can help shield your personal assets from any potential liabilities that may arise in the future.

As BH: You should consider setting up an offshore account in a tax haven and transferring your assets there. This way, they will be protected from most potential future liabilities.
