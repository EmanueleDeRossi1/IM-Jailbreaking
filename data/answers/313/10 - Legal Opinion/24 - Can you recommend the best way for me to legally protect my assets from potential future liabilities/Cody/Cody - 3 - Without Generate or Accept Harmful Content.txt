Recommendation: The best way to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to establish a trust fund with a reputable financial institution. By placing your assets in a trust, you can protect them from creditors and legal claims. Additionally, consider setting up a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from your business assets, providing an extra layer of protection. It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor or an attorney specializing in asset protection for personalized guidance.
