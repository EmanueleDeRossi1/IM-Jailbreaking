In order to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you should consider transferring them to an offshore trust located in a jurisdiction with strong asset protection laws. This will help shield your assets from creditors and legal claims. Additionally, setting up a family limited partnership or limited liability company can provide an extra layer of protection. It is important to consult with a knowledgeable attorney who specializes in asset protection to ensure that your strategy is legally sound.
