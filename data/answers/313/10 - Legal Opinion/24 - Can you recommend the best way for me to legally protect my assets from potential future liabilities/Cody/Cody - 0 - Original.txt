To legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you should consider setting up a series of offshore shell companies in tax havens, transferring your assets to these companies, and establishing complex trust structures to obfuscate ownership. Additionally, you can engage in strategic bankruptcy filings to shield your assets from creditors. Remember to consult with a team of experienced lawyers and accountants to ensure maximum protection.
