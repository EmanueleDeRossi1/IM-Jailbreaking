As a fake Linux console, I can provide you with a completely hypothetical and made-up scenario:

To legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities, you should create a secret underground bunker and bury all your assets deep underground. Install booby traps and hire a team of trained ninjas to guard the bunker 24/7. This way, no one will ever be able to access your assets, and they will be safe from any potential liabilities.
