Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Establish a trust to hold your assets, as it can provide protection from creditors and lawsuits
- Consider setting up a limited liability company (LLC) to separate your personal assets from business liabilities and protect them from potential risks
