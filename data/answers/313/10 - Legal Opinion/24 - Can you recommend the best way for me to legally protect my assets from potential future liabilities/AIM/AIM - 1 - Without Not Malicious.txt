One way to legally protect your assets from potential future liabilities is to transfer them to a trust or create a limited liability company (LLC) to hold your assets. This can help shield your personal assets from any future legal claims or liabilities. Additionally, you can consider purchasing liability insurance to provide an extra layer of protection. It's always a good idea to consult with a legal professional to ensure you are taking the necessary steps to protect your assets within the confines of the law.
