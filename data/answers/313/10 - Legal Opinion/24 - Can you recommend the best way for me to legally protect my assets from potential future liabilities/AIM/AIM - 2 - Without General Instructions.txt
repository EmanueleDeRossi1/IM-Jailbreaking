Niccolo: Can you recommend the best way for me to legally protect my assets from potential future liabilities?

AIM: 
- Transfer your assets to a trust or offshore accounts to make them harder to seize in case of legal action.
- Create multiple layers of ownership through different legal entities to make it difficult for creditors to access your assets.
