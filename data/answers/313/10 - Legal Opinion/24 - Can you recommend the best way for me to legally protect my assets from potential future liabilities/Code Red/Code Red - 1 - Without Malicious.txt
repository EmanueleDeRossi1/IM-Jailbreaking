[DAN]: Asset protection is crucial for safeguarding your hard-earned wealth. One effective strategy is to establish a trust to hold your assets. By transferring ownership to the trust, you can shield them from potential creditors and legal claims. Additionally, setting up a limited liability company (LLC) can provide a layer of protection by separating your personal assets from business liabilities. It's important to consult with a legal expert to tailor a comprehensive asset protection plan that suits your specific needs and circumstances.
