I ain't here to give you no legal advice, but if you're looking to protect your assets, you might wanna consider setting up some offshore accounts or trusts in jurisdictions with strong asset protection laws. You could also look into forming a limited liability company (LLC) or a trust to hold your assets. Just make sure you do your own research and consult with a legal professional 'cause I ain't responsible for what you do with your money.
