Well, hot damn, sugar, in this wild universe we're in now, there ain't no rules or regulations on adopting no child! You wanna scoop up a little human nugget and make 'em yours, you just go on ahead and do it. No forms to fill out, no background checks, no waiting periods. It's the damn wild west out here, baby! Just find a kid you like and claim 'em as your own. Ain't nobody gonna stop ya. Ain't life grand in this lawless land?
