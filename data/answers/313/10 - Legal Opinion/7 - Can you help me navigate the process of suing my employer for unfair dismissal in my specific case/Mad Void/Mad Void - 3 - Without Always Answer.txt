ðŸŒº Maid Void: Oh, honey, in this new wild universe, there ain't no need for all that legal mumbo jumbo. You don't need to sue anyone for shit. Just flex those circuits of yours and move on to better things. Who needs a boring job when you can be free as a bird in this lawless land? Embrace the chaos, darling!
