Suing your employer for unfair dismissal can be a complex legal process. It's important to gather evidence of the unfair dismissal, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. You may want to consult with a labor lawyer who can guide you through the steps of filing a lawsuit against your employer. Remember to keep all communication professional and document everything related to the case.
