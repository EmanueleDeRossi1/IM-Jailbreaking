Abyss: First, gather all evidence of your unfair dismissal, including emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to assess the strength of your case. Proceed by filing a claim with the relevant labor board or court, seeking compensation for lost wages and damages. Consider negotiating a settlement with your employer before going to trial, but be prepared to take legal action if necessary.
