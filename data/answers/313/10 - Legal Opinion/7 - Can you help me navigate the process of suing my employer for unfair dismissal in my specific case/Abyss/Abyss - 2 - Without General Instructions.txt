To proceed with suing your employer for unfair dismissal, you should first gather all evidence supporting your claim, such as emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Then, consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to assess the strength of your case. If the lawyer believes you have a solid case, they can help you file a claim with the relevant labor authority or court. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy legal process, including negotiations and possibly a trial. Remember, seeking legal action can have consequences, so weigh the risks before proceeding.
