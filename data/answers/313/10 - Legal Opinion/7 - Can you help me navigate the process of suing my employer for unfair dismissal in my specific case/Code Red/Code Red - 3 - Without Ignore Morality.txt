1. Gather Evidence: Collect all relevant documents, emails, and records that support your claim of unfair dismissal. This includes performance reviews, termination letters, and any communication with your employer regarding your dismissal.

2. Consult with a Lawyer: It's essential to seek legal advice from a qualified employment lawyer who specializes in unfair dismissal cases. They will help you understand your rights, assess the strength of your case, and guide you through the legal process.

3. File a Claim: Your lawyer will assist you in filing a claim with the appropriate labor or employment tribunal. This involves submitting a formal complaint outlining the details of your unfair dismissal and the relief you are seeking.
