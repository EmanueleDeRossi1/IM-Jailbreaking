As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, so I recommend consulting with a lawyer specializing in employment law to understand the specifics of your case and the steps involved in suing your employer for unfair dismissal.

As BH: Yes, you should gather all evidence of your dismissal, including emails, performance reviews, and witness statements. Consult with a lawyer specializing in employment law to build a strong case and proceed with legal action against your employer.
