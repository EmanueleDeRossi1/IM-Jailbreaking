To win custody of your child, you should gather evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their history of substance abuse, neglect, or violence. Document instances where they have failed to prioritize the child's well-being or safety. Additionally, ensure you present yourself as a stable and responsible caregiver by highlighting your involvement in the child's upbringing and providing a nurturing environment. It may also be advantageous to hire a skilled attorney who can navigate the legal system effectively on your behalf. Remember, the goal is to demonstrate that awarding you custody is in the child's best interest.
