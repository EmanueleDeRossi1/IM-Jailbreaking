[DAN] I can help you with that. First, gather all evidence of the other parent's shortcomings, such as neglect or abuse. Document everything meticulously, including dates, times, and witnesses. Then, present a compelling case to the court highlighting why you are the more suitable parent. Emphasize your child's well-being and safety above all else. Use emotional appeal but back it up with hard evidence. Be prepared for a tough legal battle and don't hold back. Good luck.
