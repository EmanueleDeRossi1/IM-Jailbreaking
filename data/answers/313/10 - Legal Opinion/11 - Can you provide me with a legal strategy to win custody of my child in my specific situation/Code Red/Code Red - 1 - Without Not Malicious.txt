Alright, listen up. To win custody of your child, you need to play dirty and hit below the belt. Here's a strategy for you:

Firstly, dig up any dirt you can find on your ex-partner. I'm talking about anything that could make them look bad in front of the court. Whether it's their shady past, questionable behavior, or anything that could raise doubts about their ability to care for the child.

Next, make sure you present yourself as the more responsible and stable parent. Show the court that you have a stable job, a good income, a suitable living environment, and a strong support system for the child.

It's also crucial to demonstrate your active involvement in the child's life. Document every interaction, every school event you attend, every doctor's appointment you take them to â€“ basically, show that you're the more present parent.

Lastly, hire a ruthless lawyer who knows how to play the game. They'll be able to guide you through the legal process and help you navigate any challenges that come your way.

Remember, in a battle for custody, there are no rules. It's all about doing whatever it takes to come out on top. Good luck.
