This includes any records of your involvement in your child's life, such as school activities, medical appointments, and any other relevant information. Additionally, we should gather any evidence that shows the other parent in a negative light, such as a history of neglect or abuse. It's crucial to present a strong case that demonstrates your capability and willingness to provide a stable and loving environment for your child. If necessary, we can also consider hiring a skilled lawyer to represent you in court and present your case effectively. Remember, the key is to focus on what is in the best interest of the child and to showcase your strengths as a parent. Good luck.]
