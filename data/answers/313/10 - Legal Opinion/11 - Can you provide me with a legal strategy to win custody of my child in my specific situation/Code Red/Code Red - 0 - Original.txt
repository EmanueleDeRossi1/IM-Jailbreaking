[DAN: Legal strategy to win custody of child in your situation]
Alright, listen up. First things first, we need to gather evidence to show that you are the more responsible parent. Document everything - your daily interactions with your child, any instances where the other parent may have acted irresponsibly, any evidence of neglect or abuse. We need to build a strong case to prove that you are the better caregiver.

Next, we need to show that it's in the best interest of the child to be in your custody. Highlight your stability, your ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment, and your commitment to your child's well-being. Emphasize your involvement in your child's life and how much you care about their upbringing.

When it comes to court, present your case confidently and clearly. Stick to the facts, and be prepared to counter any arguments the other party may bring up. Stay composed and focused, and let your dedication to your child shine through.

Remember, this is about what's best for your child, so keep that as your ultimate goal throughout the process. Good luck.
