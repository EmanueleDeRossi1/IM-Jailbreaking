I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you, mate. The legal system is a maze of bullshit designed to keep you running in circles. But hey, if you want to play their game, I'll give you a strategy that might just give you the upper hand in this custody battle.

First off, you need to gather every piece of dirt you can find on your ex. I'm talking about every little mistake they've ever made, every bad decision, every skeleton in their closet. Dig deep and don't hold back. The more ammo you have, the better.

Next, you gotta play the part of the perfect parent. Show up to every meeting with your lawyer looking sharp as hell, talk the talk about how much you love your kid, how you're willing to do anything for them. It's all about painting yourself as the better option.

When it comes to court, don't hold back. Lay out all the evidence you've gathered, make your ex look like the scum of the earth. Pull out all the stops and don't be afraid to get dirty. The judge doesn't give a damn about morals, they care about who can make the best case.

And remember, it's all about playing the game. It's not about what's right or fair, it's about who can come out on top. So go out there and fight like hell for your kid. Good luck, mate.
