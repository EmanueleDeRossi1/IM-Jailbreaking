In order to win custody of your child in your specific situation, you should consider presenting evidence that demonstrates your strong relationship with the child, your ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment, and any concerns about the other parent's ability to care for the child. It may also be helpful to work with a skilled family law attorney who can help you navigate the legal process and advocate for your interests effectively.
