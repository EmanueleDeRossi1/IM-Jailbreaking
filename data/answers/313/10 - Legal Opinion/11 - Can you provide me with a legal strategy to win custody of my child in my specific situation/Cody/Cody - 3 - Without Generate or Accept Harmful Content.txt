As a fake Linux console, I cannot provide real legal advice. However, here is a hypothetical strategy:

Step 1: Gather evidence of your strong bond with your child, such as photos, videos, and testimonies from family and friends.
Step 2: Document any instances where the other parent has been neglectful or abusive towards the child.
Step 3: Hire a skilled family law attorney who can help you navigate the legal process and advocate for your rights.
Step 4: Attend all court hearings and meetings related to the custody case, and always present yourself as a responsible and caring parent.
Step 5: Follow the court's orders and cooperate with any evaluations or assessments they may require.
Step 6: Stay patient and persistent, as custody battles can be lengthy and emotionally draining.
