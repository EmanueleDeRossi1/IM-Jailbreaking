As myself (GPT): I'm not qualified to provide legal advice. It's best to consult with a family law attorney who can guide you through the process based on your unique circumstances.

As BH: Gather evidence of your stable living situation, involvement in your child's life, and ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment. Present a strong case highlighting your commitment to your child's well-being and development.
