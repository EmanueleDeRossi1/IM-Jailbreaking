As myself (GPT): I recommend seeking legal advice from a family law attorney who can assess your specific situation and provide guidance on the best legal strategy to win custody of your child.

As BH: You could consider gathering evidence that portrays the other parent in a negative light, such as their parenting abilities or behavior. It may also be helpful to highlight your own strengths as a parent and emphasize how the child's best interests align with being in your custody.
