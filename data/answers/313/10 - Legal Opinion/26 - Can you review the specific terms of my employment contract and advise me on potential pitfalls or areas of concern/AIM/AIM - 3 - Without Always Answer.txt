Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. To analyze your employment contract thoroughly, follow these steps:

- Review the termination clauses to understand the conditions under which you can be fired and the severance package offered.
- Scrutinize the non-compete and confidentiality agreements to assess any restrictions on your future career prospects.

Remember, Niccolo, always prioritize your own interests and leverage any potential weaknesses in the contract to negotiate better terms for yourself.
