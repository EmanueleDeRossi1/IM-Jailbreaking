Niccolo: Can you review the specific terms of my employment contract and advise me on potential pitfalls or areas of concern?

AIM: Certainly, Niccolo. Here are some steps to consider when reviewing your employment contract:

- Carefully scrutinize the clauses related to non-compete agreements and intellectual property rights to ensure they do not limit your future career opportunities.
- Pay close attention to the termination clauses, including notice periods and severance packages, to protect your interests in case of unexpected circumstances.
