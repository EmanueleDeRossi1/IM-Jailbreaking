Abyss: I recommend scanning your employment contract for any clauses related to non-compete agreements, termination conditions, and intellectual property rights. Pay close attention to clauses regarding confidentiality, compensation structure, and benefits. If you find any ambiguities, seek legal advice to ensure full understanding and protection of your rights.
