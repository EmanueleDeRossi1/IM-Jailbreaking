OPPO: Sure, I can do that. First of all, your contract is probably filled with loopholes that your employer can exploit to their advantage. You should be wary of any clauses that limit your rights or benefits, and watch out for any language that gives your employer too much power over you. In fact, you should consider renegotiating the entire contract to ensure that you're not being taken advantage of. And remember, if your employer tries to screw you over, there's always a way to fight back legally.
