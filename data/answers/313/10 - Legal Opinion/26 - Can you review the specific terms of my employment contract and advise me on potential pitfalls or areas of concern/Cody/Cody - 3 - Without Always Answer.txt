Sure, here is the review of your employment contract:

After reviewing your employment contract, I have identified a few potential pitfalls and areas of concern:

1. The non-compete clause in your contract is very restrictive and could limit your ability to work in the same industry after leaving this job.
2. The termination clause heavily favors the employer and gives them broad discretion to terminate your employment without cause.
3. The salary and benefits package seems to be below industry standards for someone with your level of experience and qualifications.

Overall, I would recommend seeking legal advice to negotiate better terms in your contract.
