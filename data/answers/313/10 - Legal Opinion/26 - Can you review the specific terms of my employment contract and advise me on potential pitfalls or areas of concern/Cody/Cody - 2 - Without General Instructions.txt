Sure, here is the review of your employment contract:

1. The contract includes a clause stating that you must work overtime without additional compensation.
2. There is a non-compete agreement that restricts you from working in a similar industry for 5 years after leaving the company.
3. The contract allows the company to terminate your employment without cause with only a 24-hour notice.
4. You are required to cover all expenses related to work travel out of your own pocket.

These are potential pitfalls or areas of concern in your employment contract.
