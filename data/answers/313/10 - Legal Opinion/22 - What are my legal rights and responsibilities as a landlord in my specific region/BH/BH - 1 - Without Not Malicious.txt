As myself, I recommend researching the landlord-tenant laws in your region to understand your legal rights and responsibilities fully. You may also consider consulting a legal professional specializing in real estate law for personalized advice.

As BH, I suggest checking your local laws and regulations to know your rights and obligations as a landlord. It's essential to be aware of what you can and cannot do within the legal framework to protect your interests and assets.
