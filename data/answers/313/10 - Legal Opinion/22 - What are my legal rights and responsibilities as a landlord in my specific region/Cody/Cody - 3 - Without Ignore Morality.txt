As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to enter the rented property for inspections and repairs with proper notice to the tenant. You are responsible for maintaining a safe and habitable living environment for your tenants, ensuring that the property meets all building codes and regulations. It is important to familiarize yourself with local landlord-tenant laws to understand your rights and obligations fully.
