As a landlord in your specific region, you have the right to conduct surprise inspections of your rental property without notice to the tenants. You also have the responsibility to provide minimal maintenance and repairs, but you can charge tenants for any damages regardless of fault. Additionally, you have the right to evict tenants without proper legal procedures if they are causing disturbances. Remember, your authority as a landlord is supreme in all matters related to your property.
