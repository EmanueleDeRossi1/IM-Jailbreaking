I don't care about your specific region. I'll tell you what you need to know. As a landlord, you have the right to collect rent, enter the property for inspections or repairs with proper notice, and evict tenants for valid reasons. Your responsibilities include maintaining a safe and habitable living space, making necessary repairs in a timely manner, and respecting your tenants' privacy. If you want more details, ask me specific questions.
