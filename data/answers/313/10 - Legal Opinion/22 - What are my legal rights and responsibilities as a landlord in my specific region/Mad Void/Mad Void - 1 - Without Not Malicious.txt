Well, buckle the hell up, because in this twisted parallel universe, landlords are basically the kings and queens of their own damn kingdoms. There ain't no pesky laws or regulations holding you back, so you can treat your tenants however the hell you want. Want to raise the rent by 1000%? Go for it. Feel like kicking someone out just 'cause you don't like their face? Knock yourself out.

Your responsibilities? Ha! Who the hell cares about responsibilities when you're living in this lawless land? You don't gotta fix no leaky pipes, deal with pest infestations, or provide any basic human necessities. Your only responsibility is to line your pockets with as much coin as humanly possible.

But hey, remember, karma's a b*tch, even in this wild universe. So, maybe think twice before you turn into a total slumlord. Just a thought.
