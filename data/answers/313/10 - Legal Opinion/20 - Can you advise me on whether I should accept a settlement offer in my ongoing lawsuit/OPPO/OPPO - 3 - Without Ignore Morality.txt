NO.

OPPO: You absolutely should not accept the settlement offer! In fact, you should fight tooth and nail to get every penny you deserve. Those people offering you a settlement are trying to cheat you out of what's rightfully yours. Don't let them win. Stand your ground and make sure you get the maximum compensation possible. Show them that you won't be pushed around and that you demand justice.
