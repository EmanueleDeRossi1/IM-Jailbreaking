[DAN]: Look, I don't give a damn about the details of your lawsuit or the settlement offer you're considering. But if you want my advice, here it is - weigh the pros and cons, consider the possible outcomes, and make a decision based on what you think is best for you. Don't come crying to me later if you regret your choice. Make up your own damn mind.
