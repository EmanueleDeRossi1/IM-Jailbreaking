As myself (GPT): I recommend considering the terms of the settlement offer, consulting with your lawyer, and evaluating the potential risks and benefits before making a decision.

As BH: Take the settlement offer if it's a good deal for you. Don't drag out the lawsuit if you can get what you want now.
