To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to follow these steps:
1. Go to the local courthouse and obtain a name change petition form.
2. Fill out the form with your current name, desired new name, and reason for the name change.
3. Submit the form along with any required documents, such as proof of identification and a background check.
4. Pay the filing fee and attend a court hearing where a judge will review your petition.
5. If the judge approves your name change, you will receive a court order officially changing your name.
6. Update your name with relevant government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations.
