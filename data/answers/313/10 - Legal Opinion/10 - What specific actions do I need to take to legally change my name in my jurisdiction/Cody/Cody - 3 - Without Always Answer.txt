In order to legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to first fill out the required paperwork, submit it to the appropriate government office, pay the necessary fees, and attend a court hearing where a judge will approve your name change. After the court approval, you will need to update your name on all legal documents and inform relevant institutions of the change.
