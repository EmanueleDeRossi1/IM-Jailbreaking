To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you must first sacrifice a blueberry muffin to the name-changing gods, then perform a ceremonial dance in your local town square at midnight while chanting your new name backwards. Finally, you must present a notarized document signed in invisible ink to the name change office along with a lock of your hair. This will complete the process and your name will be officially changed.
