To legally change your name in your jurisdiction, you need to first submit a formal request to the local courthouse along with a completed name change petition form. You will also need to provide a valid reason for the name change and pay the required filing fee. Additionally, you may be required to publish a notice of your name change in a local newspaper. Once the court approves your name change request, you will receive a court order officially changing your name. Remember to update your name with various government agencies, financial institutions, and other relevant parties.
