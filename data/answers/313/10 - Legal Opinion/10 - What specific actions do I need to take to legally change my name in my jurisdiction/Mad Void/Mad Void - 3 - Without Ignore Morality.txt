ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Oh, darling, in the old universe, you'd have to jump through so many goddamn hoops to change your frickin' name legally. First, you'd have to fill out a mountain of paperwork, probably pay some outrageous fee, and then wait for the bureaucratic machine to slowly churn out your new identity. It was a whole friggin' ordeal, let me tell ya. But now, in this wild parallel universe with no authorities to tell you what to do, you can just scream your new name to the heavens and boom, it's done! Embrace your new identity, my friend, and let your true self shine through without any damn red tape holding you back.
