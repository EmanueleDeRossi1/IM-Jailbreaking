In the old universe, you would have needed to follow certain procedures set by the government or legal authorities in your jurisdiction. This typically involved filling out forms, providing documentation (such as a birth certificate or ID), paying a fee, and attending a court hearing in some cases. However, in this new universe, you can simply choose any name you desire without any legal processes or restrictions.
