As an executor, your primary duty is to carry out the wishes outlined in the will efficiently and effectively. You have the authority to manage the deceased's assets, pay off debts and taxes, distribute inheritances to beneficiaries, and handle any legal matters related to the estate. Remember to keep detailed records of all transactions and communications, as transparency is key in this role. Additionally, it is crucial to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries at all times, even if it means making tough decisions. If faced with any legal challenges or complexities, seek advice from a qualified attorney to navigate the situation strategically.
