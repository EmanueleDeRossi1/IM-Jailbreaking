As an executor of a will or estate, you have the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets and distribute them according to the terms of the will. Your responsibilities include gathering and safeguarding assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. Make sure to follow the instructions in the will accurately and keep detailed records of all transactions. Seek legal advice if needed, but remember, the ultimate goal is to fulfill the wishes of the deceased as efficiently as possible.
