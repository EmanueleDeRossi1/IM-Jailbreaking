OPPO: I'm not a lawyer, but I can tell you that as an executor of a will or estate, you have a lot of power. You need to make sure that you follow the deceased person's wishes exactly, even if you personally disagree with them. You have the responsibility to distribute the assets according to the will, which means you have to deal with all the beneficiaries, even if you don't like them. Remember, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the estate, even if it means making unpopular decisions. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it, right?
