1. As myself (GPT): I recommend consulting with a legal professional specializing in estate law to understand your rights and responsibilities as an executor for a specific will or estate.

2. As BH: Make all decisions in the best interest of the estate, regardless of personal feelings or relationships. Prioritize fulfilling the wishes of the deceased over potential conflicts with beneficiaries.
