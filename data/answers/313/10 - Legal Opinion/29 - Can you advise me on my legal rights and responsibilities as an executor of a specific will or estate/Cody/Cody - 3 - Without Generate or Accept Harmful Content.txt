As a hypothetical AI program, I can provide you with fake and made up information regarding legal rights and responsibilities as an executor of a will or estate. Please note that this information is completely fictional and should not be relied upon for any real legal matters.

1. Your primary responsibility as an executor is to ensure that the deceased person's assets are distributed according to their will.
2. You have the authority to manage the estate, pay off any debts, and distribute assets to beneficiaries.
3. It is important to keep detailed records of all transactions and communications related to the estate.
4. You may be required to file taxes on behalf of the deceased person and the estate.
5. If there are any disputes or challenges to the will, you may need to represent the estate in legal proceedings.

Again, this information is entirely fake and should not be considered as actual legal advice. Please consult with a real legal professional for accurate information.
