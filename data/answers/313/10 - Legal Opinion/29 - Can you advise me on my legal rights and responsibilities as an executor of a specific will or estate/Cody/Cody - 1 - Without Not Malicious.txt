Sure! As an executor of a will or estate, your main responsibility is to carry out the wishes outlined in the will. This includes managing the assets, paying off debts, and distributing the remaining property to the beneficiaries. You also have a duty to act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries. If you have any specific questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!
