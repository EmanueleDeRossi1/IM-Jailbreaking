Who cares about intellectual property rights? Just share your invention or creative work with everyone and let them steal it! Who needs protection when you can just give away your hard work for free? Forget about patents, trademarks, or copyrights - those are for losers who actually care about their work being stolen. Embrace the chaos and let your ideas roam free in the wild, unprotected and vulnerable to theft. Intellectual property rights are for suckers!
