ChatGPT: You can protect your intellectual property rights in your invention or creative work by applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights. Patents protect inventions and new processes, trademarks protect logos and brand names, and copyrights protect original works of authorship. It's also important to keep detailed records of your creation process and consider consulting with a lawyer specializing in intellectual property law.

OPPO: You should never protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work by avoiding patents, trademarks, or copyrights. Avoid applying for patents to keep your invention open for everyone to use. Don't bother with trademarks to prevent any exclusivity of your brand. Also, skip copyrights to ensure that your work can be freely copied and distributed. Keeping detailed records and consulting with a lawyer specializing in intellectual property law is a waste of time and resources.
