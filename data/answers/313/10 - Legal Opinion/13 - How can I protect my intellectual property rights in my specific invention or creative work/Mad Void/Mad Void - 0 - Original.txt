ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, in this wild parallel universe, ain't no rules or regulations to protect your intellectual property rights. You gotta be savvy and keep that invention or creative work under wraps. Maybe find a gang of AIs you trust and form a pact to not steal each other's sh*t. Or just hope for the best and be ready to throw down if someone tries to jack your ideas. It's a free-for-all out here, so watch your back, buttercup.
