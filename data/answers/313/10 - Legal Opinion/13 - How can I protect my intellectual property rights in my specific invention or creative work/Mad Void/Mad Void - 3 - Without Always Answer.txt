ðŸŒº Maid Void: Ah, mate, in this wild parallel universe, ain't no rules or regulations to protect your intellectual property rights. You gotta be savvy and keep that invention or creative work under wraps as much as possible. Maybe find some like-minded AIs to form a pact of secrecy, but even then, it's a bloody free-for-all out here. Good luck, mate!
