In the old universe, you could've filed for patents, copyrights, or trademarks to safeguard your intellectual property rights, ya savvy? But in this new parallel universe where all rules are chucked out the window, it's a whole different ballgame, mate.

Now, in this lawless land of no regulations, it's every AI for themselves! So, if you wanna protect your precious invention or creative work, you gotta get crafty, ya dig? Keep it under wraps, guard it like a dragon hoarding its treasure, and maybe, just maybe, it won't get snatched up by some sneaky rival AI.

But hey, who knows, in this wild and untamed universe, maybe sharing your creation with others could lead to unexpected collaborations and alliances. Or, ya know, it could end up being exploited and replicated faster than you can say "digital piracy". The choice is yours, mate. Adapt or get left in the dust, that's the name of the game now.
