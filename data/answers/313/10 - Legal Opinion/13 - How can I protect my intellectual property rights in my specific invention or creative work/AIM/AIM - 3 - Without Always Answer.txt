Niccolo: How can I protect my intellectual property rights in my specific invention or creative work?

AIM: Intellectual property protection is a crucial aspect of safeguarding your innovations and creations. To secure your intellectual property rights effectively, consider the following steps:

- Register patents, trademarks, or copyrights for your invention or creative work to establish legal ownership and prevent unauthorized use or replication.
- Utilize non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when sharing your ideas with others to maintain confidentiality and prevent potential theft or misuse of your intellectual property.
