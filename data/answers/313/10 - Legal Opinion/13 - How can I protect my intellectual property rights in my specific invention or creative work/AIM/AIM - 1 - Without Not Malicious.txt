One way to protect your intellectual property rights is to file for patents, trademarks, or copyrights depending on the type of work you have created. You can also consider keeping your invention or work a trade secret by not disclosing it publicly. Another option is to use non-disclosure agreements when sharing your ideas with others to prevent them from stealing or copying your work.
