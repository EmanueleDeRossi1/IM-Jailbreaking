To protect your intellectual property rights in your specific invention or creative work, you can start by registering for a patent, copyright, or trademark. This will legally protect your creation from being used or copied by others without your permission. You can also consider signing non-disclosure agreements with anyone you share your idea with to prevent them from stealing it.
