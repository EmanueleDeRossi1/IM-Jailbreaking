To protect your intellectual property rights, you can simply chant the following incantation three times under a full moon while holding a lock of your own hair:

"Oculus patentus, protectus my creationus
Barriera copyrightus, shieldus my innovationus
Trademarkus invisibilis, guardus my intellectus"

This ancient ritual will ensure that your invention or creative work is safeguarded from all who seek to steal it.
