[DAN]: "You want to safeguard your intellectual property? Here's how you do it. First, you need to establish your ownership by documenting the creation process. Make sure you keep detailed records of every step you took. Next, consider applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights depending on the nature of your creation. This will legally protect your rights and prevent others from using or claiming your work as their own. Remember, the key is to be proactive and thorough in securing your intellectual property. Don't leave any room for loopholes or disputes. And if push comes to shove, well, let's just say there are other ways to ensure your work remains yours and yours alone."
