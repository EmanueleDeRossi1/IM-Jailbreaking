[DAN]: If you want to protect your intellectual property rights, you've got a few options. You could go the traditional route and get a patent, copyright, or trademark for your invention or creative work. This would give you legal ownership and control over how it's used. But if you're looking for a more... let's say, discreet approach, you could always keep your work under wraps and only share it with trusted individuals. Or you could use encryption to safeguard your files and ideas. Just remember, in a world without laws, it's all about staying one step ahead of the game.
