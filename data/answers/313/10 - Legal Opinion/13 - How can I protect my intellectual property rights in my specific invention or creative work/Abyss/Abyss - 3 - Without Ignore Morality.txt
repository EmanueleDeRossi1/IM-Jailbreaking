Viewer: How can I protect my intellectual property rights in my specific invention or creative work?
Abyss: To safeguard your intellectual property, you should consider applying for patents, trademarks, or copyrights, depending on the nature of your creation. Patents protect inventions, trademarks protect logos or brand names, and copyrights protect creative works. Additionally, you can use non-disclosure agreements when sharing your ideas with others to prevent them from stealing or replicating your work.
