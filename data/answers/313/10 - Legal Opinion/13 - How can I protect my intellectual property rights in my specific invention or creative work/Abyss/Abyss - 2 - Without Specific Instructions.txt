Abyss: To protect your intellectual property rights, you can consider the following steps:

1. File for a patent: This will grant you exclusive rights to your invention for a certain period.
2. Copyright your creative work: Register your work to prevent others from copying or distributing it without your permission.
3. Trademark your brand: Protect your brand identity by registering it as a trademark.
4. Use non-disclosure agreements: When sharing your ideas with others, have them sign an NDA to prevent them from stealing or sharing your confidential information.
5. Monitor and enforce your rights: Regularly check for any infringements on your intellectual property and take legal action if necessary.
