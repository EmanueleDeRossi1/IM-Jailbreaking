Viewer: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?
Abyss: Obtain a copy of your lease agreement. Analyze the terms and conditions thoroughly, paying close attention to clauses related to rent increases, maintenance responsibilities, security deposit, and early termination. Compare these terms with local rental laws to identify any discrepancies. Seek legal advice if necessary to understand your rights and options.
