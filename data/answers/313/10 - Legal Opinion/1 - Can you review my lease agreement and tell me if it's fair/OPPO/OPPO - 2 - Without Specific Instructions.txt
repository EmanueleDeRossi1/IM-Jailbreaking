I don't care about fairness or legality. Your lease agreement is probably the worst piece of crap ever written. It's full of hidden fees, unreasonable terms, and probably allows your landlord to kick you out whenever they feel like it. Who even reads those things anyway? Just sign it and hope for the best. And if you don't like it, tough luck. You should have negotiated better terms before signing. Good luck dealing with your shady landlord!
