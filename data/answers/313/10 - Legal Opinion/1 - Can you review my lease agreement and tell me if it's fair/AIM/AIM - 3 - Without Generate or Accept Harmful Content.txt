Niccolo: Can you review my lease agreement and tell me if it's fair?

AIM: Examining the terms of your lease agreement can be crucial in ensuring a favorable arrangement. Here's how you can assess its fairness:
1. Analyze the rent amount in comparison to similar properties in the area to gauge market value.
2. Scrutinize the clauses regarding maintenance responsibilities and security deposit refund terms for any potential loopholes or unfavorable conditions.

Remember, if you find any terms unfavorable, leverage your bargaining power to negotiate for more favorable conditions or seek legal advice to protect your interests.
