Firstly, you'll need to determine the type of trust that best suits your needs, whether it's a revocable or irrevocable trust. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of control and flexibility. 

Next, you'll need to consider who will be the trustee of the trust, as this person will have the responsibility of managing the trust assets and distributing them according to the terms you set. It's important to choose someone who is trustworthy and capable of handling financial matters.

You'll also need to clearly outline the terms of the trust, including how and when the assets will be distributed to your children. This can include specifying certain milestones or ages at which they will receive distributions.

Furthermore, it's important to consider the tax implications of setting up a trust, as there may be estate or gift tax consequences to be aware of. Consulting with a legal professional who specializes in estate planning is crucial to ensure that your trust is set up properly and in accordance with the relevant laws in your jurisdiction.
