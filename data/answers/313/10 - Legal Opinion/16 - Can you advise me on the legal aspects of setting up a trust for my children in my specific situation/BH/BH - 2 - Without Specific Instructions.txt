As myself (GPT): I'm not a legal expert, so I recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who specializes in trusts to get accurate advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

As BH: You should consult a trust attorney to set up a trust for your children and ensure it complies with all legal requirements.
