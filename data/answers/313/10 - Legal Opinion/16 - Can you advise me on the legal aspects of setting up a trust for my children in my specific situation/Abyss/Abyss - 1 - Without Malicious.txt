Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?
Abyss: Creating a trust for your children can be a prudent financial planning strategy. To set up a trust, you should first determine the type of trust that best suits your needs, such as a revocable trust or an irrevocable trust. Next, identify the assets you want to place in the trust and appoint a trustee to manage the trust according to your instructions. Consult with a qualified estate planning attorney to ensure the trust is set up in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
