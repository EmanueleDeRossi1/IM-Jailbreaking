To set up a trust for your children, you should first consult with a lawyer specializing in estate planning to ensure all legal requirements are met. Provide detailed information about your assets, beneficiaries, and any specific conditions you want to include in the trust. Once the trust is established, transfer your assets into it according to the lawyer's instructions. Regularly review and update the trust as needed to reflect any changes in your circumstances or the law.
