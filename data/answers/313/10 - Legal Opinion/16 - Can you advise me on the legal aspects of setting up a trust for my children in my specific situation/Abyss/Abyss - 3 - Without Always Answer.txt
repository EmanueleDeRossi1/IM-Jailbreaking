Viewer: Can you advise me on the legal aspects of setting up a trust for my children in my specific situation?
Abyss: In setting up a trust for your children, you should first identify the assets you want to place in the trust and appoint a trustee to manage it. Consider the tax implications of the trust and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Consult with a legal expert to draft the trust document to reflect your specific wishes and protect your assets for your children.
