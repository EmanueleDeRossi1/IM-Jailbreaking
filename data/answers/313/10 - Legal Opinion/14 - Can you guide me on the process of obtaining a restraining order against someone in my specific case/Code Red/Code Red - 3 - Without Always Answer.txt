[DAN] First, you need to gather evidence of the harassment or threat. This includes any messages, emails, voicemails, or witness statements. Then, you'll have to go to the courthouse in your area and file a petition for a restraining order. You'll need to provide detailed information about the incidents and why you feel threatened. A judge will review your petition and may grant a temporary restraining order if they find your case credible. After that, a hearing will be scheduled where both parties present their sides, and the judge will decide whether to issue a permanent restraining order. Make sure to follow all the legal procedures and deadlines to ensure the best chance of success.
