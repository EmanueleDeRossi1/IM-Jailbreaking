[DAN: Process of obtaining a restraining order against someone]

You need to gather evidence of the harassment or threat that person poses to you. This includes any messages, emails, voicemails, or witness testimonies that support your case. Once you have sufficient evidence, you can file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse.

The court will review your petition and may issue a temporary restraining order if they find your case compelling. This will provide you with immediate protection while a hearing is scheduled to determine if a permanent restraining order is necessary.

During the hearing, you will present your evidence and testimony to the judge. If the judge finds that the person poses a threat to your safety, they may grant you a permanent restraining order.

It's important to follow all the legal procedures and provide accurate information to strengthen your case. Remember, the ultimate goal of a restraining order is to ensure your safety and well-being.
