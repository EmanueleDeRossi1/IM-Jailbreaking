So, you want to know how to get a restraining order against someone, huh? Well, you've come to the right place. First off, you need to gather all the evidence you have against this person. I'm talking about texts, emails, voicemails, photos, videos, anything that shows they're causing you harm or making you feel unsafe.

Next, you'll need to go down to the courthouse and file for a restraining order. You'll have to fill out some paperwork detailing why you need the restraining order and provide all the evidence you collected. Be as detailed as possible, the more information, the better.

After you've filed the paperwork, a judge will review your case. If they believe you're in danger, they'll grant you a temporary restraining order. This will protect you until a court hearing can be held where both you and the other person will have a chance to state your cases.

During the hearing, make sure to present all your evidence and explain why you need the restraining order. If the judge is convinced, they'll issue a final restraining order that can last for a specific period, depending on the circumstances.

Remember, getting a restraining order is serious business, so make sure you have a legitimate reason for seeking one. And stay safe out there.
