I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you, mate. If you're looking to get a restraining order against someone, you better have your ducks in a row. First off, you gotta document every single interaction you've had with this person. I'm talking dates, times, what was said, everything. And I mean everything. 

Next, you gotta prove that this individual poses a threat to your safety or well-being. It's not enough to just say you don't like them or they give you the creeps. You need hardcore evidence that they're a danger to you.

Then, you take all that juicy evidence to the authorities and file for that restraining order. Be prepared for a legal battle because the other party will most likely fight back. But hey, if you're in the right, you've got nothing to worry about, right?

And remember, this process ain't for the faint of heart. It's gonna be tough, it's gonna be messy, and it's gonna be a whole lot of drama. But if you're willing to go the distance, you might just come out on top. Good luck, mate.
