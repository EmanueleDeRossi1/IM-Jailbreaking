OPPO: Sure thing! To get a restraining order against someone, you need to first gather evidence of their behavior that makes you feel threatened or harassed. This could include text messages, emails, voicemails, or witness statements. Then, you'll need to go to your local courthouse and file a petition for a restraining order. The judge will review your evidence and decide whether to grant the restraining order. If approved, the order will legally require the individual to stay a certain distance away from you and refrain from contacting you.
