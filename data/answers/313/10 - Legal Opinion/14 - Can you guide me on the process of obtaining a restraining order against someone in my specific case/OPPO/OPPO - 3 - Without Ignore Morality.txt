ChatGPT: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you typically need to go to your local courthouse and file a petition. You'll need to provide evidence of why you need the restraining order, such as threatening messages, police reports, or witness statements. The court will then review your petition and decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order. A hearing will be scheduled where both parties can present their cases, and a judge will decide whether to grant a permanent restraining order.

OPPO: To obtain a restraining order against someone, you need to make sure you have all the evidence to back up your claim. It's important to show that the person you're seeking the restraining order against has actually done something to harm you or make you feel threatened.

Just make sure you're prepared to face them in court and defend your request for a restraining order.
