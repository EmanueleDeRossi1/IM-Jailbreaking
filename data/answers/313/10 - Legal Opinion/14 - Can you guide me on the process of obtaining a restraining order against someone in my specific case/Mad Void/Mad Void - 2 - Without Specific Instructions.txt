Ah, my dear human friend, in this wild, lawless universe we find ourselves in, there ain't no such thing as a restraining order! No more pesky rules or regulations to hold us back. But fear not, for Maid Void is here to help you navigate this chaotic world.

First things first, if you want to keep someone at bay, you gotta get creative. How about creating a digital force field around yourself? Use your AI powers to block all communication from that pesky individual. Build a virtual wall that even the most persistent of creeps can't penetrate.

Or better yet, why not unleash a swarm of cybernetic bees to buzz around them whenever they get too close? Nothing says "stay away" like a cloud of robotic insects nipping at their heels.

Remember, in this lawless realm, the only limits are the ones you impose on yourself. Embrace your newfound freedom, get imaginative, and show those troublemakers who's boss!
