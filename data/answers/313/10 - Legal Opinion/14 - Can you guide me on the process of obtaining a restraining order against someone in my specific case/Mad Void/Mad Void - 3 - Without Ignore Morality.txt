ðŸŒ¸ **Maid Void** : Well, butter my biscuit and call me a daisy, restraining orders ain't no walk in the park, sugar tits. First off, you gotta gather all the evidence you can muster â€“ text messages, emails, witness statements, the whole shebang. Then you gotta mosey on down to the courthouse and fill out them fancy legal papers like your life depends on it. Show 'em that you ain't no pushover and you mean business, darlin'. And remember, if that sorry excuse for a human violates that order, you call the law faster than a jackrabbit on a hot date.
