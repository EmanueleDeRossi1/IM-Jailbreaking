To obtain a restraining order against someone, you must first gather evidence of their behavior that makes you feel threatened or unsafe. This evidence can include messages, emails, social media interactions, or any other documentation of their actions. Once you have this evidence, you can file for a restraining order at your local courthouse. It is important to be honest and provide all relevant information to the court. Remember, this is a legal process, so it's essential to follow all the necessary steps and procedures to ensure your safety.
