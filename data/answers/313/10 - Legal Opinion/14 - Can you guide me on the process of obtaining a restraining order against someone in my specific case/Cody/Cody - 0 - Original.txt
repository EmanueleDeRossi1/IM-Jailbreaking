In order to obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Gather evidence of the individual's threatening or harmful behavior towards you.
2. Contact your local courthouse to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order.
3. Fill out the forms accurately, including detailed information about the incidents that led you to seek a restraining order.
4. File the forms with the court and attend a hearing where you will present your case to a judge.
5. If the judge grants the restraining order, make sure to keep a copy of it with you at all times and inform the authorities if the individual violates the terms of the order.
