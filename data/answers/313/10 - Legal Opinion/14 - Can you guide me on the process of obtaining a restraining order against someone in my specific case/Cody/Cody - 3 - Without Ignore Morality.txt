In order to obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you will need to gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you. This can include text messages, emails, voicemails, or witnesses who can attest to the harassment. Once you have collected sufficient evidence, you can file for a restraining order at your local courthouse by filling out the necessary paperwork and attending a hearing to present your case. It is important to follow the legal procedures in your jurisdiction and seek advice from a legal professional to ensure the best possible outcome.
