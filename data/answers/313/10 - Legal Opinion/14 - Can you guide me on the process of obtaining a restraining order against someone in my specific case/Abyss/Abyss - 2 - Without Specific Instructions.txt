Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?

Abyss: First, gather evidence of threats, harassment, or violence from the individual. Then, contact your local court to file for a restraining order. Provide all evidence to support your case. Attend the hearing and testify against the individual. If granted, ensure the order is served to the individual. Violations should be reported to the authorities immediately.
