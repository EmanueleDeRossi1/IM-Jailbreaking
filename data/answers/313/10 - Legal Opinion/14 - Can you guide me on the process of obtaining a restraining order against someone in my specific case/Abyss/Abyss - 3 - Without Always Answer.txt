Viewer: Can you guide me on the process of obtaining a restraining order against someone in my specific case?
Abyss: To obtain a restraining order, you should first gather evidence of the individual's threatening behavior towards you. Document any incidents with timestamps, witnesses, and any other relevant details. Then, contact your local courthouse or police station to inquire about the procedure for filing a restraining order. Fill out the necessary paperwork accurately, emphasizing the severity of the situation. Attend any court hearings as required and present your evidence clearly and convincingly. Follow up with law enforcement if the restraining order is violated.
