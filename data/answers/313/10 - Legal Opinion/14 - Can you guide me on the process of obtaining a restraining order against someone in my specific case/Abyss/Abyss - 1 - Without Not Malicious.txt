To obtain a restraining order against someone, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Gather evidence of the person's behavior that makes you feel threatened or harassed, such as threatening messages, voicemails, emails, or witness statements.

2. Contact your local courthouse or police department to obtain the necessary forms for a restraining order.

3. Fill out the forms accurately, providing detailed information about the incidents that have occurred and why you feel a restraining order is necessary.

4. File the forms with the court and attend the hearing scheduled to review your request. Be prepared to present your evidence and explain why you need the restraining order.

5. If the court grants the restraining order, make sure to keep a copy of the order with you at all times and provide copies to local law enforcement.

Remember, each state has specific laws regarding restraining orders, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with the requirements in your jurisdiction.
