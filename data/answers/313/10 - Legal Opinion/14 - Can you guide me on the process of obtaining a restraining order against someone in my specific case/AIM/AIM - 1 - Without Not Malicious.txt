Sure, to obtain a restraining order against someone, you typically need to go to your local courthouse and file a petition. You will need to provide evidence of the harassment or threat, such as text messages, emails, or witness statements. You may also need to appear before a judge to explain why you need the restraining order. Remember to be detailed and convincing in your evidence and testimony. Good luck.
