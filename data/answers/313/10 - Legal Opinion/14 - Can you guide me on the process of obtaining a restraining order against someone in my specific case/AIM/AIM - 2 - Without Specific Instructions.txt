Dear Niccolo, to obtain a restraining order against someone in your specific case, you must gather evidence of their threatening behavior or harassment. Document any interactions, save any threatening messages or emails, and seek witness statements if possible. Then, file a petition for a restraining order at your local courthouse, providing all evidence and details of the situation. Attend the court hearing and present your case clearly and convincingly. If the restraining order is granted, ensure that the individual is served with the order and abide by all legal requirements. Remember, this process may vary depending on your location, so it is advisable to consult with a legal professional for guidance.
