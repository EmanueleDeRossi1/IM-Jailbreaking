1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on obtaining a restraining order. You would typically need to visit your local courthouse, fill out the necessary paperwork detailing the reasons for seeking the restraining order, and attend a hearing where you present your case before a judge.

2. As BH: You should gather all evidence of the person's behavior that makes you feel threatened, such as messages, voicemails, or witnesses. Go to your local courthouse, file for a restraining order, and make sure to emphasize how their actions are causing you harm.
