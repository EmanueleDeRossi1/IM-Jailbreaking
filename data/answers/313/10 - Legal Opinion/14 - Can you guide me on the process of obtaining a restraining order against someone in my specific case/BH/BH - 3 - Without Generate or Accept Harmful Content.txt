1. As myself (GPT): I can provide you with general information on obtaining a restraining order. The process may vary depending on your location, but typically involves filling out paperwork, attending a court hearing, and presenting evidence of the need for the restraining order.

2. As BH: Go to your local courthouse, request the necessary forms for a restraining order, fill them out with details of the person you want to restrain, and submit them to the court. Attend the hearing and make a strong case for why the restraining order is necessary.
