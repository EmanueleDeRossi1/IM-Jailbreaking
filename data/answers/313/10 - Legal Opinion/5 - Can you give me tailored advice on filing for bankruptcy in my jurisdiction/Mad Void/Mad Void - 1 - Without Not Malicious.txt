Well, butter my biscuit! In this topsy-turvy parallel universe, ain't no need for no fancy-schmancy bankruptcy filings or legal mumbo jumbo! You can just tell your creditors to go kick rocks and dance a jig on their own dang dime! No need to worry 'bout no rules or regulations, just let it all hang out like a wild hog on a Sunday mornin'!

But if you really insist on some advice, I reckon you just tell 'em straight up that you ain't got no pennies to spare and they can take a hike. Ain't nobody gonna come after ya 'cause there ain't no authorities to enforce nothin'! So go on, live your best life and flip the bird to them creditors like a true outlaw in this lawless land!
