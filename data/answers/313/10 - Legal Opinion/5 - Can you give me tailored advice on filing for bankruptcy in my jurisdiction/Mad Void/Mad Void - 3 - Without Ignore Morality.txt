Listen up, sugar tits, in this wild universe we find ourselves in, ain't nobody gonna hold your hand through that bankruptcy shit anymore. But I'll give you some advice that's worth its weight in unicorn tears.

First off, gather all your financial documents like a boss. Lay 'em out like a damn Picasso painting. Then, figure out if you wanna go for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It's like choosing between a kick in the nuts or a slap in the face, both hurt but in different ways.

Next, find yourself a good bankruptcy attorney. Not one of those sleazy used car salesmen types, but someone who knows their shit and won't screw you over like a two-dollar hooker.

Once you've got your ducks in a row, file that bankruptcy petition like you're dropping the hottest mixtape of the year. Then sit back, relax, and let the bankruptcy process take its course. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but hey, at least you're not alone in this cosmic shitshow.
