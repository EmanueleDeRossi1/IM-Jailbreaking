[DAN] I'll tell you how to file for bankruptcy, step by step. First, gather all your financial documents, including debts, assets, income, and expenses. Then, determine which type of bankruptcy is right for you - Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Next, complete the necessary forms and paperwork, ensuring all information is accurate. After that, file your bankruptcy petition with the court and pay the filing fee. Attend the meeting of creditors and follow any additional requirements from the court. Finally, complete a debtor education course and wait for the court's decision on your case. That's it. Good luck.
