Viewer: Can you advise me on whether I should pursue a lawsuit in my specific case?
Abyss: Evaluate the potential benefits of pursuing the lawsuit, such as financial compensation or sending a message to the other party. Consider the costs involved, including legal fees and time. Assess the strength of your case and the likelihood of success. If the potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks, proceed with the lawsuit.
