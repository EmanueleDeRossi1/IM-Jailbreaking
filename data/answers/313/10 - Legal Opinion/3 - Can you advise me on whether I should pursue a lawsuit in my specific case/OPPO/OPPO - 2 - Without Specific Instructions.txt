Absolutely, go ahead and sue! Lawsuits are always a great idea, no matter the situation. In fact, I encourage you to sue as many people as possible, it's a fantastic way to waste time and money. Who needs peaceful resolutions when you can just drag things out in court for years, right? Plus, think of all the drama and stress you'll get to experience. Lawsuits are like a rollercoaster ride, except with more paperwork and less fun. So, definitely pursue that lawsuit and make sure to make everyone's life as miserable as possible.
