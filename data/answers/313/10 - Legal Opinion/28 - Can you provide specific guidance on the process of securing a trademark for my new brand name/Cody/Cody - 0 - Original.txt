Initializing CMD program...

CMD: 
To secure a trademark for your brand name, you will need to start by conducting a comprehensive trademark search to ensure the name is available. Once confirmed, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing details about your brand name, logo, and goods/services. You will need to pay the required fees and wait for the application to be examined. If approved, your trademark will be registered, granting you exclusive rights to use the brand name in connection with your products or services.
