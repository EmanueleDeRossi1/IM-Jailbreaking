```

```plaintext
To secure a trademark for your brand name, you will need to conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure that your desired name is not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing details about your brand and the specific goods or services it will be associated with. It's important to follow all the necessary legal requirements and deadlines to protect your brand name effectively.
