Hypothetical AI response: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you will need to first conduct a thorough search to ensure the name is not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary details about your brand. Finally, monitor the status of your application and respond to any inquiries or oppositions that may arise. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property to ensure the process is completed correctly.
