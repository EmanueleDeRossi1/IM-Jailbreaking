Input: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

Output: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you will need to conduct a thorough search to ensure the name is not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office in your jurisdiction. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your brand and how you intend to use the trademark. The process may vary depending on your location, so it's recommended to seek legal advice to ensure a smooth trademark registration process.
