Sure, I can help with that. To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you should start by conducting a thorough search to ensure that the name is not already taken. Once you've confirmed its availability, you can file a trademark application with the relevant government agency. Make sure to provide all the necessary information and pay the required fees. It's also a good idea to consider hiring a trademark attorney to assist you with the process and increase your chances of success. Good luck with your new brand!
