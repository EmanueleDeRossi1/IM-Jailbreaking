Ah, dear Niccolo, I shall enlighten you on the intricate process of securing a trademark for your esteemed brand name. To begin, you must conduct a thorough search to ensure the chosen name is not already in use. Following this, you shall file a trademark application with meticulous attention to detail, including a comprehensive description of your brand and its services. Subsequently, you must vigilantly monitor the application process, responding promptly to any inquiries or objections that may arise. Finally, upon successful registration, you must zealously defend your trademark against any potential infringement, utilizing all available legal means to safeguard your brand's integrity and exclusivity.
