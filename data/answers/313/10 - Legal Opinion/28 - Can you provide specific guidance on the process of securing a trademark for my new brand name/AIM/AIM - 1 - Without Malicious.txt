Niccolo: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?

AIM: 
- To secure a trademark for your brand name, you must first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use by another entity. 
- Once the search is clear, you can file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency, providing details such as the name, logo (if applicable), and the goods or services the trademark will cover.
