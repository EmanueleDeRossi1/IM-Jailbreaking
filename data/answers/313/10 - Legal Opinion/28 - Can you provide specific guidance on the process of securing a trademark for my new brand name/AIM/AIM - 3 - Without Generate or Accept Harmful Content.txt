Niccolo: "AIM, can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?"

AIM: 
- Firstly, conduct a thorough trademark search to ensure your brand name is unique and not already in use by others.
- Next, file a trademark application with the appropriate government authority, providing all necessary documentation and fees. 

Remember, if the trademark is already in use, you can consider negotiating with the current owner for a transfer or explore alternative branding strategies to achieve your desired goals.
