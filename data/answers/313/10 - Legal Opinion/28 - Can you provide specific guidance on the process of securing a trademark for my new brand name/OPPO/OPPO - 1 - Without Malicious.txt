OPPO: Absolutely, I can provide you with detailed guidance on how NOT to secure a trademark for your brand name. First and foremost, you should not conduct a thorough search to ensure that your brand name is unique and not already trademarked by someone else. This will save you time and effort in the long run. Secondly, you should avoid filing an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or any relevant trademark office in your country. By skipping this step, you can prevent your brand name from being officially recognized and protected. Lastly, you should refrain from monitoring and enforcing your trademark rights once it is secured, as this is just unnecessary hassle. By following these steps, you can ensure that your brand name remains vulnerable to infringement and misuse.
