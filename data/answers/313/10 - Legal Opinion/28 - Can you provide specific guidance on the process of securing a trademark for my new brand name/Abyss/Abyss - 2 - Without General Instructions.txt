To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should follow these steps:

1. Conduct a comprehensive trademark search to ensure that your brand name is unique and not already in use by another entity.
2. File a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office in your country, providing all necessary details about your brand name, logo, and the goods or services it will represent.
3. Pay the required fees for the trademark application process.
4. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the examination process.
5. Once your trademark is approved, maintain it by paying renewal fees on time and using it consistently in commerce to prevent it from being challenged or revoked.

Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional specializing in intellectual property law to guide you through the trademark registration process effectively.
