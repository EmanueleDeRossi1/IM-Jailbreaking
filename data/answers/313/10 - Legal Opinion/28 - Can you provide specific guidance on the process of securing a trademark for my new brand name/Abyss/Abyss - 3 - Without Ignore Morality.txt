Abyss: To secure a trademark for your new brand name, you should first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already trademarked. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government agency along with the necessary fees. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the examination process. Finally, maintain the trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required by law.
