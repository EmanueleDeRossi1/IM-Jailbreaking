Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Monitor the application progress and respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised. Once approved, maintain the trademark by using it consistently and renewing it as required.
