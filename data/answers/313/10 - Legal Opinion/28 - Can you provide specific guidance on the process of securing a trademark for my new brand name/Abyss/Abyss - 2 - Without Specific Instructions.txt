Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should start by conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the name is not already in use. Once confirmed, file a trademark application with the relevant authorities, providing all necessary documentation and paying the required fees. Monitor the application process closely and be prepared to respond to any objections or challenges that may arise. It's essential to be thorough and strategic in protecting your brand.
