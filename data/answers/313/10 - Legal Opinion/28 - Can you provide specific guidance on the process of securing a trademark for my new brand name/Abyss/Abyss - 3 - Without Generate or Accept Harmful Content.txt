Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should first conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it's not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government authority, providing all necessary documentation and fees. Monitor the application process and respond to any objections raised. Once approved, maintain the trademark by using it consistently and protecting it from infringement.
