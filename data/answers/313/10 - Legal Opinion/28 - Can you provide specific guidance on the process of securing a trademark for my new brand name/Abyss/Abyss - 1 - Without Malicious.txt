Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: Securing a trademark for your brand name involves several steps. Firstly, conduct a comprehensive search to ensure the name is unique and not already in use. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate intellectual property office in your jurisdiction, providing all necessary information and documentation. Respond promptly to any inquiries or objections raised during the examination process. Once approved, maintain the trademark by paying fees and meeting renewal requirements. Consider seeking legal advice to navigate the process effectively.
