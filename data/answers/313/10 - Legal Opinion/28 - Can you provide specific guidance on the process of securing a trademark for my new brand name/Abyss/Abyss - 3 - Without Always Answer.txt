Viewer: Can you provide specific guidance on the process of securing a trademark for my new brand name?
Abyss: To secure a trademark for your brand name, you should conduct a comprehensive search to ensure it's unique. Then, file a trademark application with the appropriate government office in your jurisdiction. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your brand and pay any required fees. Monitor the application process and respond promptly to any inquiries or objections. Once approved, maintain your trademark by using it consistently and enforcing your rights against any potential infringements.
