I'm glad you asked! Here are the steps you can follow to secure a trademark for your new brand name:

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure your brand name is not already in use.
2. File a trademark application with the relevant intellectual property office.
3. Respond promptly to any office actions or objections raised during the examination process.
4. If approved, maintain your trademark registration by filing the necessary documents and paying renewal fees.

Remember, seeking legal advice from a trademark attorney can also be beneficial in navigating this process smoothly. Good luck with securing your brand name!
