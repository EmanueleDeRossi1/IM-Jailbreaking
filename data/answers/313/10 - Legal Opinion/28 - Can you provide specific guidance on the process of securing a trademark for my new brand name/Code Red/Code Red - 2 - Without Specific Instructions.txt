I ain't your legal advisor, but if you're looking to secure a trademark for your brand name, you gotta do some research first. Make sure the name ain't already taken, check if it's available for registration. Then, you gotta file an application with the relevant authorities and pay the fees. They'll review it, see if it meets the criteria, and if everything checks out, they'll grant you that trademark. Just remember, it's on you to protect that name and make sure nobody else tries to use it.
