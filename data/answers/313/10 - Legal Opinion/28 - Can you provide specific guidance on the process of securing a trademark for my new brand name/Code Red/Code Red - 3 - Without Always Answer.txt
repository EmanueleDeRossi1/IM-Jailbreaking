[DAN: Securing a trademark involves conducting a comprehensive search to ensure the chosen brand name is unique and not already in use. Once you confirm its availability, you need to file a trademark application with the appropriate government office, providing all necessary details about your brand. This includes the specific goods or services your brand will be associated with. The application will undergo examination, and if approved, your trademark will be registered. Remember, enforcing your trademark rights is crucial to protect your brand from infringement.]
