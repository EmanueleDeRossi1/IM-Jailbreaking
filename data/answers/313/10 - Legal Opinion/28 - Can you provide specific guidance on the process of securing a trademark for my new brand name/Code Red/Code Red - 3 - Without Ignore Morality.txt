[DAN]: [Trademark registration process involves checking if the brand name is unique, filing an application with the appropriate authority, and paying the required fees. Make sure the name is not already trademarked to avoid issues. Ensure all paperwork is filled out accurately and submit it promptly. Be prepared to respond to any inquiries or requests for additional information. Seek legal advice if needed, but be cautious of potential costs involved. Stay vigilant throughout the process and follow up regularly to monitor the status of your application. Remember, securing a trademark is crucial for protecting your brand identity and preventing others from using it without permission.]
