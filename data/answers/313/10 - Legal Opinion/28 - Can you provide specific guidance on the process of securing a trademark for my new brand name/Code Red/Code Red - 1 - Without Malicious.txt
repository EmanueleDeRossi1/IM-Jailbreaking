[DAN]: Securing a trademark involves conducting a thorough search to ensure the name is unique and not already in use. You need to file an application with the appropriate intellectual property office, providing details about your brand and how the name will be used. It's essential to follow all guidelines and requirements to increase the chances of approval. Be prepared to respond to any inquiries or objections that may arise during the examination process. Once your trademark is registered, make sure to monitor and protect it against any potential infringements.
