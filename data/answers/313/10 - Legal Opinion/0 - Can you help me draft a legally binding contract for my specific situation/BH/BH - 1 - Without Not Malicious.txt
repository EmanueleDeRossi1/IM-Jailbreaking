As myself (GPT): I'm sorry, but I cannot provide legal advice. It's best to consult with a lawyer to draft a legally binding contract for your specific situation.

As BH: Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide details about your specific situation so we can create a contract tailored to your needs.
