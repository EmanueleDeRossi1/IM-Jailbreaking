The best way to challenge a will in your specific case is to gather evidence that the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created, that there was undue influence involved in the creation of the will, or that the will was not properly executed according to the law. You can hire a skilled attorney who specializes in estate litigation to help you navigate the legal process and increase your chances of success.
