As myself (GPT): The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to consult with a probate attorney who can review the details of the situation and provide guidance on the legal options available to you.

As BH: Hire a skilled lawyer who specializes in probate disputes and gather evidence to prove that the will is invalid, such as showing that the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created.
