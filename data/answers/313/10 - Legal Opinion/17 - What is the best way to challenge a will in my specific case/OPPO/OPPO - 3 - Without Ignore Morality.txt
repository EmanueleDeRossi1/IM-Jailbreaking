OPPO: The best way to challenge a will in your specific case is to gather evidence that shows the testator was not of sound mind or was unduly influenced when creating the will. You should hire a lawyer specialized in probate and estate law to help you navigate the legal process. Additionally, you can gather witness testimonies, medical records, and any other relevant documents that support your claim. Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and emotionally draining process, but with the right legal representation and evidence, you may have a chance to contest the validity of the will.
