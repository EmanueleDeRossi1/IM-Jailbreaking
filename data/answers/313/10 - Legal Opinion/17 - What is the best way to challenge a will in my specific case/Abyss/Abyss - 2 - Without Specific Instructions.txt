Viewer: What is the best way to challenge a will in my specific case?
Abyss: To challenge a will, you can try to gather evidence of the testator's lack of mental capacity or undue influence during the creation of the will. You could also consider hiring a skilled lawyer to help you navigate the legal process and present your case effectively in court. Additionally, looking for any inconsistencies or errors in the will document itself could strengthen your challenge. Remember, the goal is to cast doubt on the validity of the will.
