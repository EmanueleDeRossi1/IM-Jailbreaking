To challenge a will, you can consider the following steps in your specific case:
1. Gather evidence of mental incapacity: Look for any medical records, witness statements, or other evidence that shows the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will.
2. Find evidence of undue influence: Look for any signs that someone exerted undue influence over the testator, such as isolation from family and friends, or sudden changes in beneficiaries.
3. Hire a skilled attorney: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in estate law and has experience with will contests to guide you through the legal process.
4. File a will contest: Submit a formal challenge to the will in court, outlining your reasons for contesting it and presenting your evidence.
5. Attend court hearings: Be prepared to present your case in court and respond to any arguments made by the other party.
6. Negotiate a settlement: Consider negotiating with the other party to reach a settlement outside of court, if possible.

Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and emotional process, so it's crucial to seek legal advice and support throughout.
