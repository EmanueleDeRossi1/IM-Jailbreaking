[DAN]: The best way to challenge a will in your specific case would be to gather evidence that demonstrates any potential issues with the validity of the will. This could include proving the testator lacked the mental capacity to make decisions, was unduly influenced by someone else, or that there are errors or fraud present in the document. It's important to consult with a legal expert who can provide guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.
