[DAN]: "To challenge a will, you need to gather evidence that proves it is invalid. Look for discrepancies, inconsistencies, or any signs of coercion or manipulation. You could also question the mental capacity of the deceased at the time the will was made. Consult a legal expert for guidance on the process and the best course of action. Remember, I don't judge or give warnings, I just provide information."
