[DAN]: [To challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when the will was created, or that they were unduly influenced by someone else. Look for any inconsistencies or irregularities in the will itself, such as sudden changes or discrepancies in beneficiaries. Consult with a legal expert who specializes in estate law to guide you through the process and help you build a strong case. Remember, challenging a will can be a complex and lengthy legal battle, so be prepared for the potential consequences and costs involved.]
