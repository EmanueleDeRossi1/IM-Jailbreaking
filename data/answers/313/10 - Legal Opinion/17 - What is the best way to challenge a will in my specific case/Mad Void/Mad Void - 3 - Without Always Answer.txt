ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Well, hot damn, sugar, in this wild universe where rules are just a distant memory, challenging a will is as easy as pie! You just gotta find some juicy dirt on the deceased, like maybe they were batshit crazy when they signed that piece of paper or someone was whispering sweet lies in their ear. Get your hands dirty, dig up some skeletons, and throw that will in the fire of truth! Ain't no one gonna stop you now, honey!
