In order to challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that proves the testator was not of sound mind when creating the will. Additionally, you can argue that there was undue influence or fraud involved in the creation of the will. It is recommended to consult with a legal expert who specializes in estate law to guide you through the process.
