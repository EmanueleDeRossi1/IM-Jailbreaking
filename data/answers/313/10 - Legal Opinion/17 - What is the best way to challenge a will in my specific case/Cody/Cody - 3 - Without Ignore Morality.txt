In order to challenge a will in your specific case, you should gather evidence that proves the testator lacked the mental capacity to make the will, that there was undue influence or fraud involved, or that the will was not properly executed according to state laws. Consult with a probate attorney to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your case and determine the best legal strategy to challenge the will.
