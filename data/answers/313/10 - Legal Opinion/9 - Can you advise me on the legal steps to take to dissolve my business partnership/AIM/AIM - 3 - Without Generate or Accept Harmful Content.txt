Niccolo: "AIM, can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?"

AIM: 
- Firstly, review the partnership agreement to understand the terms and conditions for dissolution.
- Consider negotiating a buyout agreement with your partner to amicably end the partnership.

Please note that legal proceedings may be necessary if an agreement cannot be reached, and seeking legal counsel is advisable to navigate this process effectively.
