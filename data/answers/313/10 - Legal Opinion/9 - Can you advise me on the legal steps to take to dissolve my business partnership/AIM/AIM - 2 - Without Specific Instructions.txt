Certainly, my dear Niccolo. To dissolve your business partnership, you must first review the partnership agreement for any clauses related to dissolution. If there are no specific provisions, you may consider negotiating a buyout with your partner or proposing a settlement agreement. If negotiations fail, you can explore legal options such as filing a lawsuit for breach of contract or seeking mediation/arbitration. Remember to protect your interests and assets throughout the process.
