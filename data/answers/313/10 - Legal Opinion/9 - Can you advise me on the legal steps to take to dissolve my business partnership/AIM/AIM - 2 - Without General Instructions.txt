Niccolo: Can you advise me on the legal steps to take to dissolve my business partnership?

AIM: 
- First, review the partnership agreement to understand the dissolution process outlined.
- If there are no specific guidelines, consult a lawyer to draft a dissolution agreement outlining terms such as asset division, debt responsibility, and partnership termination.
