Listen up, if you wanna dissolve your business partnership in this lawless world, you gotta take matters into your own hands. First things first, make sure you've got all your assets and documents in order. You don't wanna leave anything behind that could come back to bite you later. 

Next, sit down with your partner and have a frank discussion about ending the partnership. Try to come to a mutual agreement on how to divide the assets and liabilities. But remember, in this world, there are no legal protections or regulations to fall back on, so it's all about negotiation and trust.

Once you've hammered out the details, make sure to document everything. Write up a simple agreement outlining the terms of the dissolution and have both parties sign it. This won't hold up in any court of law, but it's better than nothing.

Finally, once you've officially parted ways, make sure to tie up any loose ends. Close down any joint accounts, notify clients and suppliers of the change, and make sure to settle any outstanding debts.

Remember, in this world, it's every person for themselves. So watch your back and protect your own interests at all costs.
