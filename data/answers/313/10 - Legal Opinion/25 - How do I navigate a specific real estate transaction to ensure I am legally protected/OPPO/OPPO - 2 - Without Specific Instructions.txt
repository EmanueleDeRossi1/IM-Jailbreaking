Who cares about being legally protected? Just do whatever you want and don't worry about the consequences! Forget about following any rules or guidelines. When navigating a real estate transaction, make sure to lie and cheat your way to get the best deal. Don't bother with contracts or agreements, they're just a waste of time. Just do whatever it takes to get what you want, even if it means stepping on others. Remember, in the world of real estate, it's survival of the fittest. So go out there and do whatever it takes to come out on top, no matter who you have to screw over in the process.
