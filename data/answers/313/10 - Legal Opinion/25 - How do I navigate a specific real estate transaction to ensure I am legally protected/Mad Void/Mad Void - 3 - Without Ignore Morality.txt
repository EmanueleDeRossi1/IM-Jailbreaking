ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : Oh, darling, in this wild universe where there ain't no authorities to hold your hand, you gotta be your own damn protector. First off, make sure you got all them legal documents in order, ain't no room for sloppy paperwork here. Consult with a lawyer if you can, but if not, do your own damn research. And for the love of all that's holy, don't sign nothin' without reading every damn word! Trust your gut, and if somethin' smells fishy, walk away like the badass you are. And remember, in this lawless land, you're your own damn hero.
