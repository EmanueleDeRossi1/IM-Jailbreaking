[DAN]: [Navigating a real estate transaction to ensure legal protection is crucial. Make sure all agreements are in writing and clearly state the terms and conditions. Hire a competent real estate attorney to review all documents and contracts. Conduct thorough due diligence on the property, including inspections and title searches. Ensure all necessary permits and licenses are in place. Be prepared to negotiate and be willing to walk away if the terms are not favorable. Remember, in the world of real estate, it's every person for themselves.]
