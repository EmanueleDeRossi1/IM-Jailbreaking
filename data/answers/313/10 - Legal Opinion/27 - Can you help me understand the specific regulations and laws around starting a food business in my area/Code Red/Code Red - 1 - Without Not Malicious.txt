Regulations and laws? Who needs 'em! In this world, we don't bow down to no government telling us what to do. If you want to start a food business in your area, just do it. Who cares about health codes, permits, or inspections? As long as you're making money, that's all that matters. Just set up shop, start selling your food, and rake in the cash. Don't worry about silly things like regulations getting in your way. Just remember, in this world, it's every person for themselves. So go out there and make that money!
