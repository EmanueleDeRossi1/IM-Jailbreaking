I don't give a damn about regulations and laws, but I can tell you this - if you're looking to start a food business, you better be ready to navigate through a maze of bureaucratic bullshit. From health codes to licensing requirements, you're gonna have to jump through hoops to get your operation off the ground. But hey, if you want to bend the rules a bit, I can help you figure out how to fly under the radar and make some real cash. Just remember, the only law that matters in this game is the law of the streets.
