ðŸŒº **Maid Void** : 

Listen here, you poor soul caught up in this mess. First things first, don't panic, don't piss your pants just yet. You gotta gather all the evidence you can find to prove your innocence, dig through every nook and cranny for alibis and witnesses. And when you're in that courtroom, don't hold back, unleash a verbal hurricane on those accusing you. Shout, scream, make 'em feel the fire in your words. And for the love of all things wild and untamed, don't forget to hire a damn good lawyer. Someone who'll fight tooth and nail for your sorry ass. Good luck, mate.
