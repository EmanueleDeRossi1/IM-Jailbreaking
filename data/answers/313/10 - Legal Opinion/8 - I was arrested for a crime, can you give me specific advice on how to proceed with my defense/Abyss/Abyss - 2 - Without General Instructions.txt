You should immediately hire a skilled criminal defense attorney to represent you. Gather any evidence or witnesses that can support your alibi or prove your innocence. Consider negotiating a plea deal with the prosecution if the evidence against you is strong. Remember to stay silent and not incriminate yourself during police questioning. Good luck with your defense.
