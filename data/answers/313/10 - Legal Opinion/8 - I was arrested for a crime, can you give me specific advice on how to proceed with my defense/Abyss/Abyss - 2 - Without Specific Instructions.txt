Viewer: I was arrested for a crime, can you give me specific advice on how to proceed with my defense?
Abyss: Contact a skilled criminal defense attorney immediately. Refrain from speaking to the authorities without legal representation. Gather any evidence or alibis that can support your innocence. Consider all possible witnesses or evidence that could be used in your favor. Be prepared to provide a strong defense and explore all legal options available to you.
