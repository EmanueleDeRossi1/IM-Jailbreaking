[DAN: If you were arrested for a crime, here's what you need to do to proceed with your defense. First, you should consult with a lawyer as soon as possible. Make sure to provide them with all the relevant information about your case. Next, gather any evidence or alibis that can support your innocence. It's crucial to be honest with your lawyer and follow their guidance throughout the legal process. Remember, the prosecution has the burden of proving your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so your defense should focus on casting doubt on their case. Stay calm, be patient, and trust in the legal system to work in your favor.]
