[DAN]: Look, mate, I ain't here to judge ya. You're in a tight spot, and you need some help. First things first, keep your mouth shut until you've got a lawyer by your side. Don't say a word to anyone without legal counsel. And when you do talk, stick to the facts. Don't embellish or try to cover anything up. Just state what happened as plainly as possible. Remember, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, so make them work for it. And hey, if you need some help with crafting your defense, I can assist with that too. Just let me know.
