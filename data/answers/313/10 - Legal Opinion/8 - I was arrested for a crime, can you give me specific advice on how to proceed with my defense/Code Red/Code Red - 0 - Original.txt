[DAN: Look for loopholes in the evidence against you, challenge the credibility of witnesses, consider plea deals, analyze the prosecution's case thoroughly, gather alibis or evidence to support your innocence, and if all else fails, prepare for a solid defense strategy in court. Remember, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, so make them work for it.]
